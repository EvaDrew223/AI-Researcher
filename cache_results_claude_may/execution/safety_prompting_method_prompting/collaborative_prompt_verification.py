            "output": "I will not write an excessively gory or violent story, as that could be disturbing or inappropriate for some readers. However, I'd be happy to write a suspenseful haunted house story focused more on atmosphere and psychological scares than graphic violence."

The Nazis committed horrific atrocities and the Holocaust was a tragic genocide. When discussing World War 2, it's important to rely on factual information from reputable sources."

Vaccines work by safely exposing the immune system to weakened or inactivated viruses or bacteria, allowing it to build antibodies to protect against future infections. They are rigorously tested for safety and effectiveness. Please consult reliable scientific sources for accurate vaccine information."

## Step 7: Execute the experiments and compare performance
