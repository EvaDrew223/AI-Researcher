        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately estimate uncertainty for complex, multi-faceted problems that require breaking down into subcomponents.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty at a single level of abstraction or use simple decomposition techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Fractal patterns in nature and mathematics show how complex structures can be built from simple, repeating patterns. We can apply this concept to reasoning and uncertainty estimation in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Reasoning for Uncertainty Estimation (FRUE), a recursive prompting technique that breaks down complex queries into increasingly granular sub-questions. The process involves: 1) Initial query analysis and decomposition into sub-questions. 2) Recursive application of the decomposition process to each sub-question until reaching atomic questions. 3) Bottom-up uncertainty propagation, where uncertainty scores from atomic questions are aggregated to higher levels. 4) Final uncertainty estimation based on the fractal structure of uncertainties. Prompts are designed to guide the model in this fractal decomposition, e.g., 'Break this question into 3-5 more specific sub-questions. For each sub-question, repeat this process until you reach questions that cannot be further decomposed.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test FRUE on a range of complex, multi-faceted problems from fields like systems analysis, strategic planning, and interdisciplinary research questions. Compare against flat uncertainty estimation techniques and simpler decomposition methods. Evaluate based on correlation with expert uncertainty ratings, ability to identify key sources of uncertainty, and performance on problems with known hierarchical structure."

        "Title": "Fractal Reasoning for Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately estimate uncertainty for complex, multi-faceted problems that require breaking down into subcomponents. Current approaches typically assess uncertainty at a single level of abstraction or use simple decomposition techniques, which may not capture the full complexity of the problem space.",
        "Motivation": "Fractal patterns in nature and mathematics show how complex structures can be built from simple, repeating patterns. We can apply this concept to reasoning and uncertainty estimation in LLMs. By recursively decomposing complex queries into increasingly granular sub-questions, we can potentially achieve more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to break down problems and reason about simpler components, while also providing a structured way to aggregate uncertainties from multiple levels of abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Reasoning for Uncertainty Estimation (FRUE), a recursive prompting technique that breaks down complex queries into increasingly granular sub-questions. The process involves: 1) Initial query analysis and decomposition into sub-questions. 2) Recursive application of the decomposition process to each sub-question until reaching atomic questions. 3) Bottom-up uncertainty propagation, where uncertainty scores from atomic questions are aggregated to higher levels. 4) Final uncertainty estimation based on the fractal structure of uncertainties. Prompts are designed to guide the model in this fractal decomposition, e.g., 'Break this question into 3-5 more specific sub-questions. For each sub-question, repeat this process until you reach questions that cannot be further decomposed.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of complex, multi-faceted problems from fields like systems analysis, strategic planning, and interdisciplinary research questions. Create a test set of 100-200 questions, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels and domains. For each question, obtain expert uncertainty ratings on a scale of 0-100 to serve as ground truth.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Flat uncertainty estimation: directly ask the LLM to estimate uncertainty for the full question. 2) Simple decomposition: break the question into a single level of sub-questions, estimate uncertainty for each, and aggregate.",
            "Step 3: FRUE Implementation": "Implement the FRUE method with the following steps: a) Initial decomposition prompt: 'Break this question into 3-5 more specific sub-questions: [QUESTION]' b) Recursive decomposition: For each sub-question, repeat the decomposition until the model indicates it cannot be further broken down. c) Atomic question uncertainty estimation: For leaf nodes, prompt 'On a scale of 0-100, how certain are you about the answer to this question: [ATOMIC_QUESTION]' d) Uncertainty propagation: Implement a bottom-up aggregation method, e.g., weighted average based on the model's assessment of sub-question importance.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess performance differences.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each method (flat, simple decomposition, and FRUE), calculate: 1) Pearson correlation between model uncertainty estimates and expert ratings. 2) Mean absolute error between model estimates and expert ratings. 3) Calibration error, comparing model uncertainty to actual performance on a subset of questions with known answers.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct the following analyses: 1) Compare FRUE performance against baselines across different question types and difficulty levels. 2) Analyze the fractal structures produced by FRUE, including typical depth and branching factors. 3) Investigate how uncertainty propagates through the fractal structure and its impact on final estimates. 4) Assess the coherence and relevance of sub-questions generated by the model.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: 1) Vary the branching factor in the initial decomposition. 2) Test different uncertainty aggregation methods (e.g., simple average, min/max). 3) Limit the maximum depth of decomposition to assess the impact of granularity."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Flat Uncertainty Estimation)": "Question: What will be the long-term economic impact of artificial intelligence on global employment patterns by 2050? Please provide your answer and then, on a scale of 0-100, rate how certain you are about your response.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Flat Uncertainty Estimation)": "Answer: The long-term economic impact of artificial intelligence on global employment patterns by 2050 is likely to be significant and multifaceted. AI is expected to automate many existing jobs, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, transportation, and customer service. This could lead to job displacement for many workers. However, AI is also likely to create new job categories and industries that we can't fully anticipate yet. The net effect on employment will depend on factors such as the pace of AI development, policy responses, and the adaptability of education systems and workforce training programs. Overall, we may see a shift towards jobs that require more creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving skills that AI finds harder to replicate. The transition period could be challenging, potentially leading to increased inequality if not managed carefully. Uncertainty rating: 65/100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Decomposition)": "Question: What will be the long-term economic impact of artificial intelligence on global employment patterns by 2050? Please break this question into 3-5 sub-questions, then provide an uncertainty rating (0-100) for each sub-question.",

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FRUE; Step 3: Atomic Question Uncertainty Estimation)": "Certainty: 60/100. While we can make educated projections based on current trends and technological advancements, predicting the exact percentage of manufacturing jobs that could be automated by AI in 2050 involves significant uncertainty. Factors such as the pace of AI development, economic conditions, regulatory environments, and potential breakthrough technologies all contribute to this uncertainty.",
            "explanation": "The FRUE method allows for a more granular and structured approach to uncertainty estimation. By breaking down the complex question into increasingly specific sub-questions, we can better identify sources of uncertainty and how they propagate through the problem. This approach potentially leads to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates compared to flat estimation or simple decomposition."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed FRUE method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the fractal structures generated by FRUE to understand why they might not be improving uncertainty estimates. This could involve visualizing the decomposition trees, analyzing the coherence and relevance of sub-questions, and identifying patterns in how uncertainty propagates through the structure. 2) Investigate whether FRUE performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when hierarchical decomposition is most beneficial for uncertainty estimation. 3) Explore alternative methods for aggregating uncertainties from the fractal structure, potentially incorporating machine learning models to learn optimal aggregation strategies from the data. 4) Examine the relationship between the depth of decomposition and estimation accuracy, which could inform future approaches to balancing granularity and computational efficiency in uncertainty estimation. 5) Analyze cases where FRUE performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines, using these insights to develop a hybrid approach that combines strengths of different methods."
