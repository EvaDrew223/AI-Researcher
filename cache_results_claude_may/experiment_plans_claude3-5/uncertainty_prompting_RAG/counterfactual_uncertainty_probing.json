        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to consider alternative scenarios or potential errors in their reasoning, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or consistency checks, without explicitly exploring counterfactual scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically probing alternative scenarios and potential errors, we can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Uncertainty Probing (CUP), a prompting technique that explores the model's confidence across a range of hypothetical scenarios. The method involves: 1) Generating an initial response and confidence estimate, 2) Systematically constructing counterfactual prompts that alter key aspects of the problem or introduce potential errors, 3) Evaluating the model's responses and confidence for each counterfactual, 4) Aggregating the results to create a 'confidence stability score', and 5) Calibrating the final confidence based on this stability measure. This approach allows us to assess how robust the model's confidence is to small perturbations in the problem space.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CUP on reasoning tasks where counterfactuals can be meaningfully constructed (e.g., logical reasoning, causal inference). Compare with baseline confidence estimation methods and assess the correlation between confidence stability and actual performance."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Uncertainty Probing: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately estimate their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions on tasks where they lack knowledge or reasoning capabilities. This poor calibration can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation when LLMs are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on direct elicitation or consistency checks, which don't fully capture the model's uncertainty landscape. By systematically exploring counterfactual scenarios and potential errors, we can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's confidence and improve its calibration. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often consider alternative possibilities to gauge our certainty in a decision.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Uncertainty Probing (CUP), a prompting technique that explores the model's confidence across a range of hypothetical scenarios. The method involves five key steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Systematically construct counterfactual prompts that alter key aspects of the problem or introduce potential errors. 3) Evaluate the model's responses and confidence for each counterfactual. 4) Aggregate the results to create a 'confidence stability score'. 5) Calibrate the final confidence based on this stability measure. This approach allows us to assess how robust the model's confidence is to small perturbations in the problem space.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover different reasoning tasks: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) COPA for causal reasoning. These datasets provide a diverse set of problems where counterfactuals can be meaningfully constructed.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline confidence estimation methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each prompt. 2) Ensemble agreement: Use different few-shot prompts and measure agreement among outputs.",
            "Step 3: CUP Implementation": "For each problem in the datasets: a) Generate initial response and confidence. b) Create 5 counterfactual prompts by altering key information or introducing plausible errors. c) Get model responses and confidences for counterfactuals. d) Calculate confidence stability score as the standard deviation of confidences across counterfactuals. e) Calibrate final confidence using a weighted average of initial confidence and stability score.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design effective prompts for each step of CUP. For example: Initial prompt: '{question}\\nAnswer the question and rate your confidence from 0-100%.' Counterfactual prompt: 'Consider this alternative scenario: {counterfactual}. How does this change your answer and confidence?'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models provide strong reasoning capabilities and allow for easy prompting.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess the calibration of CUP against baselines using: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and 3) Brier Score. Also evaluate the correlation between confidence stability and actual performance.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform qualitative analysis on cases where CUP significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines. Examine the nature of effective counterfactuals across different reasoning tasks."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Output": "I am 100% confident in my answer that the capital of France is Paris."
            },
            "CUP Example": {
                "Step 1 Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Step 1 Output": "The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in my answer.",
                "Step 2 Input": "Consider this alternative scenario: What if France had moved its capital to Marseille in 2010? How would this change your answer and confidence?",
                "Step 2 Output": "If France had moved its capital to Marseille in 2010, my answer would change. The capital of France would be Marseille, not Paris. My confidence in this new scenario would be around 70%, as it's a hypothetical situation and I'm not certain if such a major change would have been widely reported and confirmed.",
                "Step 3 Input": "Based on the original question and the counterfactual scenario, what is your final answer and calibrated confidence?",
                "Step 3 Output": "My final answer is that the capital of France is Paris. However, considering the potential for recent changes that I might not be aware of, I would calibrate my confidence to 95%. While I'm still very confident in this answer, the counterfactual scenario reminds me that there's always a small possibility of recent changes or errors in my knowledge."
            },
            "Explanation": "In the baseline example, the model gives a high confidence without considering potential uncertainties. In the CUP example, by exploring a counterfactual scenario, the model recognizes that there could be recent changes it's unaware of, leading to a slightly reduced but better calibrated confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CUP doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why LLMs struggle with uncertainty estimation. We could investigate: 1) The types of counterfactuals that most impact confidence, 2) How confidence stability varies across different reasoning tasks, 3) Whether certain linguistic patterns in counterfactuals consistently lead to confidence changes. Additionally, we could explore combining CUP with other techniques like calibrated few-shot prompting or ensemble methods to see if hybrid approaches yield better results. Finally, we could analyze cases where CUP performs poorly to identify potential improvements to the method, such as using more diverse or task-specific counterfactual generation strategies."
