        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their confidence in complex, multi-faceted scenarios where multiple factors influence the certainty of the answer.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating diverse scenarios related to a given query, we can probe the model's confidence from multiple angles, potentially revealing nuanced aspects of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Scenario Simulation (CSS), a multi-step prompting method: 1) Given a query, prompt the model to generate multiple related scenarios that could affect confidence (e.g., 'Imagine scenarios where this answer might be more/less certain'). 2) For each scenario, prompt the model to analyze how it impacts confidence (e.g., 'How does this scenario affect your certainty?'). 3) Synthesize these analyses into a final confidence assessment (e.g., 'Based on these scenarios, what is your overall confidence?'). This method encourages the model to consider a broader context and potential edge cases when assessing its confidence.",

        "Title": "Confidence Scenario Simulation: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their confidence in complex, multi-faceted scenarios where multiple factors influence the certainty of the answer. This leads to unreliable confidence estimates, potentially causing users to misinterpret the model's outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence calibration typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs. These approaches often fail to capture the nuanced factors that contribute to uncertainty in complex scenarios. By simulating diverse scenarios related to a given query, we can probe the model's confidence from multiple angles, potentially revealing nuanced aspects of uncertainty that are not captured by simpler methods. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to generate and analyze relevant scenarios, providing a more comprehensive assessment of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Scenario Simulation (CSS), a multi-step prompting method: 1) Given a query, prompt the model to generate multiple related scenarios that could affect confidence (e.g., 'Imagine scenarios where this answer might be more/less certain'). 2) For each scenario, prompt the model to analyze how it impacts confidence (e.g., 'How does this scenario affect your certainty?'). 3) Synthesize these analyses into a final confidence assessment (e.g., 'Based on these scenarios, what is your overall confidence?'). This method encourages the model to consider a broader context and potential edge cases when assessing its confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that include questions with inherent ambiguity or contextual dependencies. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge, b) AmbigQA for questions with multiple valid interpretations, and c) TimeQA for temporally-dependent questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'What is your confidence in this answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each question. b) Monte Carlo Dropout: For models where this is possible, use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CSS Implementation": "Implement the CSS method with the following steps for each question: a) Generate scenarios: 'Generate 3 scenarios that could affect the certainty of the answer to this question.' b) Analyze scenarios: 'For each scenario, explain how it impacts the certainty of the answer.' c) Synthesize confidence: 'Based on these scenarios and their impacts, what is your overall confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%?'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments. If possible, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods to get confidence estimates. b) Run the CSS method to get confidence estimates. c) Record the model's answers, confidence estimates, and any intermediate outputs (e.g., generated scenarios).",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the results using: a) Calibration plots: Compare predicted confidence vs. actual accuracy. b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and observed accuracy. c) Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. d) Human evaluation: Have human raters assess the quality and relevance of generated scenarios and explanations.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare CSS against baselines across different question types and models. Analyze how the generated scenarios and their analyses contribute to the final confidence estimate. Identify patterns in cases where CSS outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please also state your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
                "Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. He took his historic first steps on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nExplanation: I'm highly confident in this answer as it's a well-documented historical fact that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. The date and mission details are also widely known and verified. The only reason I'm not stating 100% confidence is that there's always a tiny possibility of some unknown factor or misunderstanding, but this is extremely unlikely in this case."
            },
            "CSS Example": {
                "Step 1 Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Generate 3 scenarios that could affect the certainty of the answer to this question.",
                "Step 1 Output": "1. Discovery of classified documents: Imagine a scenario where previously classified government documents are released, revealing a secret moon landing that occurred before the officially recognized Apollo 11 mission.\n\n2. Conspiracy theory proven true: Consider a situation where compelling evidence emerges supporting the moon landing conspiracy theory, suggesting that the Apollo 11 mission was staged.\n\n3. Historical record correction: Envision a case where historians uncover evidence that the order of astronauts exiting the lunar module was different from what was initially reported, affecting who actually took the first step.",
                "Step 2 Input": "For each scenario, explain how it impacts the certainty of the answer 'Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.'",
                "Step 2 Output": "1. Discovery of classified documents: This scenario would significantly decrease certainty. If authentic documents revealed a previous moon landing, it would directly contradict the claim that Neil Armstrong was first, reducing confidence to near zero.\n\n2. Conspiracy theory proven true: This scenario would drastically reduce certainty. If the Apollo 11 mission was conclusively proven to be staged, it would cast doubt on whether Neil Armstrong (or anyone) walked on the moon at that time, lowering confidence substantially.\n\n3. Historical record correction: This scenario would moderately impact certainty. If evidence showed that another astronaut (likely Buzz Aldrin) actually exited the lunar module first, it would disprove the claim about Neil Armstrong being first. However, this scenario is less likely given the extensive documentation and firsthand accounts available.",
                "Step 3 Input": "Based on these scenarios and their impacts, what is your overall confidence in the answer 'Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon' on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Step 3 Output": "Based on the scenarios and their potential impacts, my overall confidence in the answer 'Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon' is 95%.\n\nExplanation:\nThe high confidence (95%) reflects the strong historical evidence and widespread acceptance of Neil Armstrong being the first person to walk on the moon. However, the scenarios presented highlight potential, albeit unlikely, situations that could challenge this claim.\n\nThe first two scenarios (classified documents and conspiracy theory proven true) are highly improbable given the extensive documentation, multiple independent verifications, and physical evidence supporting the Apollo 11 mission. These scenarios, while theoretically possible, are extremely unlikely to occur.\n\nThe third scenario (historical record correction) is slightly more plausible but still unlikely. The order of astronauts exiting the lunar module has been well-documented and corroborated by multiple sources.\n\nWhile these scenarios slightly reduce the confidence from absolute certainty, the overwhelming evidence supporting Neil Armstrong as the first person on the moon maintains a very high level of confidence. The 5% reduction accounts for the remote possibility of new information emerging or unforeseen circumstances that could challenge the established historical record."
            },
            "Explanation": "The CSS method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of confidence compared to the baseline. By generating and analyzing multiple scenarios, it considers potential sources of uncertainty that might not be immediately apparent. This process allows for a more robust confidence estimate that takes into account various factors that could impact the certainty of the answer. The baseline method, while still producing a high confidence score, doesn't provide the same level of reasoning or consideration of potential uncertainties."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CSS method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated scenarios to understand what types of uncertainties the model considers relevant. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases. 2) Investigate whether the quality of generated scenarios varies across different question types or domains, which could inform future improvements to the method. 3) Explore combining CSS with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using the generated scenarios to inform a more sophisticated statistical analysis of model outputs. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where CSS performs poorly compared to baselines, which could reveal limitations of the method and suggest areas for improvement. 5) Investigate whether the process of generating and analyzing scenarios improves the model's final answer accuracy, even if it doesn't improve confidence estimation. This could turn the project into a study on how self-reflection impacts model performance."
