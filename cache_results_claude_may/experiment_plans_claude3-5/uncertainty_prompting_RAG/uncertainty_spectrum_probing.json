    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often provide a single confidence score, which fails to capture the nuanced spectrum of uncertainties across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Typical approaches include using model logits or linguistic confidence markers to estimate overall uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express uncertainty differently for various aspects of their knowledge. By mimicking this behavior, LLMs could provide more granular and informative uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Probing (USP), a multi-step prompting technique that decomposes a response into key aspects and probes uncertainty for each. First, we prompt the LLM to identify distinct aspects of its response (e.g., factual claims, logical inferences, temporal information). Then, for each aspect, we use targeted prompts to elicit fine-grained uncertainty estimates across multiple dimensions (e.g., source reliability, logical consistency, temporal accuracy). Finally, we aggregate these estimates into an uncertainty spectrum, providing a detailed uncertainty profile for the entire response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare USP against baseline methods on diverse question-answering datasets, evaluating both overall calibration and aspect-specific uncertainty estimation. Conduct human evaluation to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the uncertainty spectra."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Spectrum Probing: Enhancing Granular Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single confidence score, which fails to capture the nuanced spectrum of uncertainties across different aspects of a response. This limitation hinders the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs, especially in critical applications where understanding the model's confidence in various parts of its response is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods, such as using model logits or linguistic confidence markers, typically estimate overall uncertainty without distinguishing between different aspects of the response. Human experts, however, often express varying levels of certainty for different parts of their knowledge. By mimicking this behavior, LLMs could provide more granular and informative uncertainty estimates. This approach could significantly enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, allowing users to make more informed decisions based on the model's responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Probing (USP), a multi-step prompting technique that decomposes a response into key aspects and probes uncertainty for each. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Aspect Identification: Prompt the LLM to identify distinct aspects of its response (e.g., factual claims, logical inferences, temporal information). 2) Targeted Uncertainty Probing: For each identified aspect, use targeted prompts to elicit fine-grained uncertainty estimates across multiple dimensions (e.g., source reliability, logical consistency, temporal accuracy). 3) Uncertainty Spectrum Aggregation: Aggregate these estimates into an uncertainty spectrum, providing a detailed uncertainty profile for the entire response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of domains and question types. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for factual knowledge, b) LogiQA for logical reasoning, and c) TimeQA for temporal reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Traditional confidence scoring using model logits, and b) Linguistic marker-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: USP Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of the USP method: a) Aspect identification prompt: 'Identify the key aspects of your response, categorizing them as factual claims, logical inferences, or temporal information.' b) Uncertainty probing prompts: For factual claims: 'Rate your confidence in this claim from 1-10 and explain why.' For logical inferences: 'Assess the strength of this inference from 1-10 and explain your reasoning.' For temporal information: 'Rate your certainty about this temporal information from 1-10 and explain your rating.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Generate a response using standard prompting. b) Apply baseline uncertainty estimation methods. c) Apply the USP method to generate an uncertainty spectrum.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "a) Overall calibration: Compare USP against baselines using standard calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error). b) Aspect-specific evaluation: Assess the correlation between USP's aspect-specific uncertainty estimates and human-annotated confidence scores. c) Interpretability study: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the uncertainty spectra.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze the results to identify: a) How USP performs compared to baselines across different question types. b) Whether certain aspects consistently show higher or lower uncertainty. c) The relationship between aspect-specific uncertainties and overall response quality."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "What was the capital of the Byzantine Empire?",
                "Output": "The capital of the Byzantine Empire was Constantinople. (Confidence: 0.92)",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score, which doesn't capture nuanced uncertainties about different aspects of the answer."
            },
            "USP Example": {
                "Input": "What was the capital of the Byzantine Empire, and when did it fall?",
                "Output": "Aspect 1 (Factual Claim): The capital of the Byzantine Empire was Constantinople. (Confidence: 9/10, Explanation: This is a well-established historical fact that I'm very confident about.)\n\nAspect 2 (Temporal Information): Constantinople fell in 1453. (Confidence: 8/10, Explanation: I'm quite certain about the year, but there's a small chance I might be off by a year or two.)\n\nAspect 3 (Logical Inference): The fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Byzantine Empire. (Confidence: 7/10, Explanation: While this is generally accepted, there could be nuances or alternative interpretations about the exact end of the empire that I'm not fully certain about.)",
                "Explanation": "USP provides a more granular uncertainty profile, distinguishing between factual, temporal, and inferential aspects of the response. This allows users to understand which parts of the answer are more or less certain."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If USP doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why granular uncertainty estimation is challenging for LLMs. We would conduct ablation studies to understand which components of USP are most effective and why others might be failing. For instance, we could analyze whether the aspect identification step is accurate, or if the model struggles with self-assessment of uncertainty for certain types of information. We could also investigate whether the performance varies across different domains or question types, which could provide insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we could explore alternative prompting strategies or uncertainty dimensions that might be more effective. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty in LLM outputs and guide future research in this area."
