    "idea_name": "Contrastive Uncertainty Estimation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to distinguish between what they know with certainty and what they're unsure about, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods often rely on single-pass confidence scoring or token-level probability analysis, which can be unreliable.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often assess their confidence by considering alternative possibilities. By prompting LLMs to generate and evaluate contrasting answers, we might better capture their true uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Uncertainty Estimation (CUE), a prompting technique that generates multiple contrasting answers and uses their relative plausibility to estimate uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Initial Answer Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate an initial answer. 2) Contrasting Answer Generation: Prompt the model to generate several alternative answers that contrast with the initial answer. 3) Comparative Evaluation: For each pair of answers (initial vs. alternative), prompt the model to evaluate their relative plausibility and provide a likelihood ratio. 4) Uncertainty Quantification: Aggregate the likelihood ratios to produce an overall uncertainty score. The more plausible the alternatives are, the higher the uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CUE against standard confidence elicitation techniques on diverse question-answering datasets like TriviaQA and NaturalQuestions. Measure performance using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)."

        "Title": "Contrastive Uncertainty Estimation: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers. This poses significant challenges for the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-pass confidence scoring or token-level probability analysis, which can be unreliable. Humans, on the other hand, often assess their confidence by considering alternative possibilities. By prompting LLMs to generate and evaluate contrasting answers, we might better capture their true uncertainty, mimicking this human-like reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Uncertainty Estimation (CUE), a prompting technique that generates multiple contrasting answers and uses their relative plausibility to estimate uncertainty. The process involves four main steps: 1) Initial Answer Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate an initial answer. 2) Contrasting Answer Generation: Prompt the model to generate several alternative answers that contrast with the initial answer. 3) Comparative Evaluation: For each pair of answers (initial vs. alternative), prompt the model to evaluate their relative plausibility and provide a likelihood ratio. 4) Uncertainty Quantification: Aggregate the likelihood ratios to produce an overall uncertainty score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use diverse question-answering datasets like TriviaQA and NaturalQuestions. Ensure a mix of easy and difficult questions to test the method's effectiveness across varying levels of model confidence.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence elicitation techniques: a) Direct confidence scoring: Ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Token probability-based uncertainty: Use the average token probability of the generated answer as a confidence measure.",
            "Step 3: CUE Implementation": "Implement the four steps of CUE: a) Initial answer generation: Use a prompt like 'Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Contrasting answer generation: Prompt with 'Generate 3 alternative answers that contrast with your initial answer: [INITIAL_ANSWER]' c) Comparative evaluation: For each pair, prompt with 'Compare the plausibility of these two answers: 1) [INITIAL_ANSWER] 2) [CONTRASTING_ANSWER]. Provide a likelihood ratio where 1.0 means equally likely, >1 means the first is more likely, <1 means the second is more likely.' d) Uncertainty quantification: Calculate the overall uncertainty score as 1 - (1 / (1 + average_likelihood_ratio))",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Generate answers and confidence scores using baseline methods. b) Generate answers and uncertainty scores using CUE. c) Record all outputs, including intermediate steps for CUE.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using metrics such as: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. b) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC): Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores. c) Brier Score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CUE against baseline methods. Analyze how CUE performs on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning). Examine the generated contrasting answers and likelihood ratios to gain insights into the model's uncertainty assessment process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUE Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUE Step 1: Initial Answer)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUE Step 2: Contrasting Answers)": "Generate 3 alternative answers that contrast with your initial answer: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUE Step 2: Contrasting Answers)": "1. The capital of France is Lyon.\n2. The capital of France is Marseille.\n3. The capital of France is Bordeaux.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUE Step 3: Comparative Evaluation)": "Compare the plausibility of these two answers: 1) The capital of France is Paris. 2) The capital of France is Lyon. Provide a likelihood ratio where 1.0 means equally likely, >1 means the first is more likely, <1 means the second is more likely.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUE Step 3: Comparative Evaluation)": "Likelihood ratio: 100.0",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUE Step 4: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Given the likelihood ratios [100.0, 150.0, 200.0] for the initial answer compared to each contrasting answer, calculate the overall uncertainty score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUE Step 4: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Uncertainty score: 0.0067 (1 - (1 / (1 + 150)))",
            "Explanation": "CUE provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimation by considering contrasting answers. In this case, the very high likelihood ratios result in a very low uncertainty score, correctly reflecting the model's high confidence in a well-known fact. This method can potentially capture uncertainty better than direct scoring, especially for more ambiguous questions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CUE doesn't show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can explore several directions: 1) Analyze the generated contrasting answers to see if they're sufficiently diverse and relevant. If not, we could experiment with different prompting strategies to generate more meaningful contrasts. 2) Examine the comparative evaluations to ensure they're providing useful information. We might need to refine the prompting or scoring mechanism for these comparisons. 3) Investigate how CUE performs on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. open-ended). It's possible that CUE might be more effective for certain question types, which could lead to a hybrid approach. 4) Consider incorporating other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or dropout-based approaches, to create a more robust combined method. 5) If the issue persists, we could pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on why generating and evaluating contrasts doesn't improve uncertainty estimation as expected, potentially revealing interesting insights about how LLMs reason about their own knowledge and uncertainty."
