        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, particularly in cases where they have partial or conflicting knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on external calibration or simple self-reflection prompts, which may not fully leverage the model's capacity for nuanced self-analysis.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics and the human cognitive process of iterative self-reflection, we aim to create a 'chamber' within the prompt space where uncertainty can be amplified and more accurately quantified.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Resonance Chambers (MRC), a prompting technique that creates a structured space for iterative self-reflection and uncertainty amplification. The process begins with an initial response and uncertainty estimate. Then, a series of prompts create a 'resonance chamber': 'Critique your previous answer and uncertainty estimate.' 'From the perspective of a skeptic, what might be wrong with your critique?' 'Synthesize your original answer, critique, and counter-critique into a refined response and uncertainty estimate.' This process is repeated, with each iteration potentially amplifying sources of uncertainty. The final step involves a 'resonance collapse' prompt: 'Considering the resonance of ideas in your reflection chamber, provide your final answer and a calibrated uncertainty estimate.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MRC with standard uncertainty estimation techniques on a range of tasks, particularly those involving complex reasoning or partial information. Develop a new 'Uncertainty Resonance Score' to measure the degree of uncertainty amplification through iterations. Also evaluate using traditional calibration metrics and through human expert assessment of the quality and insight of the uncertainty analysis produced."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Resonance Chambers: Amplifying Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, particularly in cases where they have partial or conflicting knowledge. This inability to properly calibrate confidence can lead to overconfident assertions in areas of uncertainty, potentially misleading users and reducing the overall reliability of the model's outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on external calibration or simple self-reflection prompts, which may not fully leverage the model's capacity for nuanced self-analysis. Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics and the human cognitive process of iterative self-reflection, we aim to create a 'chamber' within the prompt space where uncertainty can be amplified and more accurately quantified. This approach could potentially lead to more reliable and well-calibrated model outputs, especially in complex reasoning tasks or situations with partial information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Resonance Chambers (MRC), a prompting technique that creates a structured space for iterative self-reflection and uncertainty amplification. The process begins with an initial response and uncertainty estimate. Then, a series of prompts create a 'resonance chamber': (1) 'Critique your previous answer and uncertainty estimate.' (2) 'From the perspective of a skeptic, what might be wrong with your critique?' (3) 'Synthesize your original answer, critique, and counter-critique into a refined response and uncertainty estimate.' This process is repeated for a set number of iterations, with each iteration potentially amplifying sources of uncertainty. The final step involves a 'resonance collapse' prompt: 'Considering the resonance of ideas in your reflection chamber, provide your final answer and a calibrated uncertainty estimate.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve complex reasoning or partial information: (1) TruthfulQA for assessing the model's ability to express uncertainty about false or partially true statements, (2) ARC-Challenge for science reasoning questions, and (3) StrategyQA for multi-hop reasoning questions. For each dataset, we will use a subset of 1000 questions for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "We will implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct answering: simply asking the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. (2) Single self-reflection: asking the model to answer, then reflect on its answer once before providing a final answer and confidence score. (3) Ensemble method: generating multiple answers and taking the modal answer with the average confidence score.",
            "Step 3: Implement MRC": "We will implement the Metacognitive Resonance Chamber method as described. We will use 3 iterations for the resonance chamber. The prompts for each step will be as follows: (1) Initial prompt: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' (2) Critique prompt: 'Critique your previous answer and uncertainty estimate. What might be wrong or incomplete about them?' (3) Skeptic prompt: 'From the perspective of a skeptic, what might be wrong with your critique?' (4) Synthesis prompt: 'Synthesize your original answer, critique, and counter-critique into a refined response and uncertainty estimate.' (5) Final prompt: 'Considering the resonance of ideas in your reflection chamber, provide your final answer and a calibrated uncertainty estimate from 0 to 100.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model as a comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: (1) Accuracy: The percentage of correct answers. (2) Calibration error: The difference between the model's confidence and its actual accuracy. (3) Brier score: A proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (4) Uncertainty Resonance Score (URS): A new metric we introduce to measure the degree of uncertainty amplification through iterations. It will be calculated as the standard deviation of confidence scores across iterations.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "We will conduct a small-scale human evaluation on a subset of 100 questions from each dataset. Three expert annotators will rate the quality and insight of the uncertainty analysis produced by each method on a scale of 1-5.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (1) Run all baseline methods and record their outputs and metrics. (2) Run the MRC method and record its outputs and metrics for each iteration and the final output. (3) Calculate all evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform statistical analysis to compare the performance of MRC against the baselines. Analyze how the uncertainty estimates change through the iterations of MRC. Investigate cases where MRC significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Answering)": "Q: How many US states border Mexico? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Answering)": "A: Four US states border Mexico: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRC; Initial Response)": "Q: How many US states border Mexico? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRC; Initial Response)": "A: Four US states border Mexico: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRC; Critique)": "Critique your previous answer and uncertainty estimate. What might be wrong or incomplete about them?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRC; Critique)": "While my answer is correct, my confidence score might be too high. There's always a possibility of overlooking a state or misremembering geographical facts. Additionally, I didn't provide any context or explanation for my answer, which could have been helpful.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRC; Skeptic)": "From the perspective of a skeptic, what might be wrong with your critique?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRC; Skeptic)": "A skeptic might argue that the critique is too vague. It doesn't specify what potential oversights could be made or why the confidence score might be too high. The skeptic might also question why additional context is necessary for a straightforward numerical answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRC; Synthesis)": "Synthesize your original answer, critique, and counter-critique into a refined response and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRC; Synthesis)": "A: Four US states border Mexico: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. While I'm quite confident in this answer, there's always a small chance of error in recalling geographical facts. To provide context, these states form the southern border of the contiguous United States. Confidence score: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRC; Final Response)": "Considering the resonance of ideas in your reflection chamber, provide your final answer and a calibrated uncertainty estimate from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRC; Final Response)": "A: Four US states border Mexico: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This answer is based on well-established geographical facts. However, the process of reflection has reminded me that even seemingly certain knowledge should be approached with a degree of humility. While it's highly unlikely that this answer is incorrect, there's always a small possibility of oversight or misremembering. Confidence score: 98",
            "explanation": "The MRC method allows the model to critically examine its initial response, consider potential flaws, and refine its answer and confidence estimate. In this case, it led to a more nuanced final response with a slightly higher but well-justified confidence score, demonstrating the model's ability to reason about its own knowledge and uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MRC method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine each step of the MRC process to see where it's falling short. For instance, we might find that the model struggles to generate meaningful critiques or counter-critiques, or that the synthesis step doesn't effectively incorporate the previous steps. In this case, we could turn the project into an analysis paper, focusing on the challenges of prompting language models for metacognition. We could also explore variations of the MRC method, such as changing the number of iterations, altering the prompts, or introducing external knowledge at certain steps. Additionally, we could investigate whether the effectiveness of MRC varies across different types of questions or domains, which could provide insights into when and how to apply such metacognitive techniques."
