        "Problem": "Language models often fail to express appropriate uncertainty when faced with ambiguous or incomplete information, leading to false certainty in generated responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single-pass uncertainty estimation or simple ensembling techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from iterative human thought processes and scientific skepticism, we propose a method to progressively refine and amplify uncertainty estimates through multiple rounds of self-questioning and doubt induction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Uncertainty Amplification, a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Prompt the model to identify potential flaws or alternative viewpoints in its own reasoning. 3) Generate counterarguments to the initial response. 4) Revise the original answer and uncertainty estimate based on this new information. 5) Repeat steps 2-4 for multiple iterations, each time prompting the model to consider increasingly unlikely scenarios or extreme edge cases. 6) Aggregate uncertainty estimates across iterations, with later iterations given higher weight to capture the amplification effect.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare this method to single-pass uncertainty estimation on tasks requiring nuanced uncertainty quantification, such as scientific claim evaluation and complex decision-making scenarios. Evaluate how uncertainty estimates evolve over iterations and correlate with true task difficulty."

        "Title": "Iterative Uncertainty Amplification: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often fail to express appropriate uncertainty when faced with ambiguous or incomplete information, leading to false certainty in generated responses. This overconfidence can result in misleading or potentially harmful outputs, especially in critical applications such as medical diagnosis or financial advice.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty estimation in language models often rely on single-pass estimation or simple ensembling techniques, which may not capture the full complexity of uncertainty in natural language tasks. Drawing inspiration from iterative human thought processes and scientific skepticism, we propose a method to progressively refine and amplify uncertainty estimates through multiple rounds of self-questioning and doubt induction. This approach aims to better mimic the way humans reassess their confidence levels when faced with complex problems, potentially leading to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification in language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Uncertainty Amplification (IUA), a multi-step prompting technique that consists of the following steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Prompt the model to identify potential flaws or alternative viewpoints in its own reasoning. 3) Generate counterarguments to the initial response. 4) Revise the original answer and uncertainty estimate based on this new information. 5) Repeat steps 2-4 for multiple iterations, each time prompting the model to consider increasingly unlikely scenarios or extreme edge cases. 6) Aggregate uncertainty estimates across iterations, with later iterations given higher weight to capture the amplification effect.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) TruthfulQA for evaluating factual knowledge and uncertainty in question-answering, and 2) MedicalQA, a curated dataset of medical questions requiring nuanced uncertainty estimation. Both datasets should be split into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. b) Single-pass uncertainty estimation: use existing techniques like Monte Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles to estimate uncertainty in a single forward pass.",
            "Step 3: IUA Implementation": "Implement the Iterative Uncertainty Amplification method as described in the 'Proposed Method' section. Use GPT-4 as the base model for all experiments.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the IUA process. For example: Initial response: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100%: [QUESTION]' Flaw identification: 'What are potential flaws or weaknesses in your previous answer?' Counterargument generation: 'Generate a strong counterargument to your initial answer.' Revision: 'Based on the identified flaws and counterarguments, revise your answer and confidence score.' Edge case consideration: 'Consider an extreme or unlikely scenario that could invalidate your current answer.'",
            "Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning": "Experiment with different numbers of iterations (e.g., 3, 5, 7) and weighting schemes for aggregating uncertainty estimates across iterations. Use the validation set to determine the optimal configuration.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of the baseline methods and IUA on the test set using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy of the final answer. 2) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error). 3) Brier score to assess both accuracy and confidence calibration. 4) Qualitative analysis of uncertainty expressions in model outputs.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of IUA: a) Remove the counterargument generation step. b) Use equal weighting for all iterations instead of increasing weights. c) Vary the types of prompts used for flaw identification and edge case consideration.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the results to answer the following questions: 1) How does IUA compare to baselines in terms of accuracy and uncertainty calibration? 2) How does the uncertainty estimate evolve over iterations? 3) Are there specific types of questions where IUA shows the most improvement? 4) What are the limitations of the method?"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Flaw Identification)": "What are potential flaws or weaknesses in your previous answer about the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Flaw Identification)": "Potential flaws in my previous answer: 1) I didn't specify whether I meant the current capital or historical capital. 2) I didn't consider potential recent changes in government structure. 3) I didn't address any potential ambiguity in the definition of 'capital' (e.g., administrative vs. cultural capital).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Counterargument Generation)": "Generate a strong counterargument to your initial answer that Paris is the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Counterargument Generation)": "Counterargument: While Paris is widely recognized as the capital of France, one could argue that the European Union has increasingly centralized power in Brussels, making it a de facto capital for EU member states, including France. This shift in political dynamics could challenge the traditional notion of a single national capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Revision)": "Based on the identified flaws and counterarguments, revise your answer about the capital of France and provide an updated confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Revision)": "Revised answer: Paris is the official capital city of France, serving as its administrative and political center. However, it's important to note that the concept of a capital can have different interpretations, and the role of national capitals in the European Union context is evolving. Confidence score: 92%",
            "explanation": "The IUA method leads to a more nuanced answer with a slightly lower but potentially more accurate confidence score. It acknowledges potential ambiguities and alternative viewpoints that were not considered in the initial response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IUA method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why the method failed and use these insights to propose alternative approaches. 2) Investigate whether IUA is more effective for specific types of questions or domains, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the method. 3) Explore combining IUA with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or Bayesian neural networks, to create a hybrid approach. 4) Shift focus to analyzing how language models express uncertainty across iterations, which could provide valuable insights into their reasoning processes and limitations. This could turn the project into a more exploratory study on the nature of uncertainty in language models rather than a method for improving calibration."
