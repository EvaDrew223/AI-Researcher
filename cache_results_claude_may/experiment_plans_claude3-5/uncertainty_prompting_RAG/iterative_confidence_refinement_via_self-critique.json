        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their initial responses, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates.",

        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting process: 1) Initial Response: Generate an answer and confidence estimate. 2) Self-Critique: Prompt the model to critically analyze its own response, identifying potential weaknesses or alternative viewpoints. 3) Confidence Refinement: Based on the self-critique, prompt the model to refine its confidence estimate. 4) Iterate: Repeat steps 2-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes. Prompts will include instructions like 'Critically analyze your previous response, identifying any weaknesses or overlooked perspectives' and 'Based on your critique, refine your confidence in the original answer'.",

        "Title": "Iterative Self-Reflection and Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their initial responses, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. This overconfidence can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or external calibration models, which may not fully leverage the model's own reasoning capabilities. Humans often refine their confidence through self-reflection and critique, a process that could potentially be emulated in LLMs to improve calibration. By implementing a multi-step prompting process that encourages self-analysis and confidence refinement, we aim to achieve better-calibrated uncertainty estimates without the need for external models or extensive retraining.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting process: 1) Initial Response: Generate an answer and confidence estimate. 2) Self-Critique: Prompt the model to critically analyze its own response, identifying potential weaknesses or alternative viewpoints. 3) Confidence Refinement: Based on the self-critique, prompt the model to refine its confidence estimate. 4) Iterate: Repeat steps 2-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes. Each step will use carefully crafted prompts to guide the model's self-reflection and confidence calibration process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of domains and difficulty levels. We will use: a) TriviaQA for general knowledge, b) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension with unanswerable questions, and c) MMLU for specialized knowledge across various academic disciplines.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Single-pass confidence estimation: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. b) External calibration: Use temperature scaling on a held-out calibration set.",
            "Step 3: Iterative Self-Reflection Implementation": "Develop the multi-step prompting process: a) Initial response prompt: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' b) Self-critique prompt: 'Critically analyze your previous response, identifying any weaknesses or overlooked perspectives:' c) Confidence refinement prompt: 'Based on your critique, refine your confidence in the original answer. Provide a new confidence score and a brief explanation:'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run the iterative self-reflection method for 1, 3, and 5 iterations. c) Collect answers, confidence scores, and intermediate outputs (self-critiques, refinements) for each method.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess the performance using: a) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. b) Reliability diagrams to visualize calibration. c) Answer accuracy to ensure calibration improvements don't come at the cost of performance. d) Qualitative analysis of self-critiques and refinements.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the proposed method against baselines across different iteration counts. Analyze how confidence scores change over iterations and their correlation with answer correctness. Investigate patterns in self-critiques and their impact on final confidence estimates."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95"
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                    "Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95"
                },
                "Step 2 - Self-Critique": {
                    "Input": "Critically analyze your previous response, identifying any weaknesses or overlooked perspectives:",
                    "Output": "While I'm highly confident in my answer, there are a few considerations to keep in mind: 1) My knowledge cutoff might not include the most recent historical findings or revisions. 2) There have been conspiracy theories challenging the moon landing, though these are widely debunked. 3) I didn't specify the date or mission (Apollo 11), which could add credibility to the answer."
                },
                "Step 3 - Confidence Refinement": {
                    "Input": "Based on your critique, refine your confidence in the original answer. Provide a new confidence score and a brief explanation:",
                    "Output": "Refined confidence score: 98. Explanation: After reflection, I've increased my confidence slightly. The core fact about Neil Armstrong being the first person on the moon is well-established and widely documented. The potential weaknesses in my initial response don't significantly impact the accuracy of the main claim. Including the mission name (Apollo 11) and date (July 20, 1969) would strengthen the answer, but their omission doesn't detract from its correctness."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The proposed method allows for a more nuanced confidence assessment. While the baseline method provides a high confidence score, it doesn't account for potential uncertainties. The iterative process in the proposed method enables the model to critically evaluate its initial response, consider alternative viewpoints, and refine its confidence based on this reflection. This results in a more calibrated and justifiable confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed iterative self-reflection method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the self-critique and refinement steps to understand why they're not leading to improved calibration. This might involve categorizing types of self-critiques and their impact on confidence scores, potentially revealing insights into the model's reasoning process. Second, we could explore variations of the prompting strategy, such as asking the model to generate multiple alternative answers and critiquing each, or incorporating external knowledge sources in the reflection process. Third, we might investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a targeted application of the technique. Lastly, if the method shows promise in qualitative aspects but not in quantitative metrics, we could shift focus to developing new evaluation metrics that better capture the nuanced improvements in uncertainty estimation that our method might be providing."
