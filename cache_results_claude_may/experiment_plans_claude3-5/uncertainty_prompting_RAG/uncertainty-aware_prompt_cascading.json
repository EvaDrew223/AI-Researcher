    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty, especially for complex multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning do not explicitly account for uncertainty accumulation in multi-step reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by error propagation in scientific calculations, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling uncertainty at each reasoning step and propagating it through the chain can lead to more accurate final uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Cascading (UPC), which decomposes complex tasks into a series of sub-prompts. For each sub-prompt, the model is asked to provide both an answer and an uncertainty estimate. Subsequent prompts incorporate previous uncertainties, gradually building a comprehensive uncertainty profile. The final prompt aggregates all uncertainties to produce a calibrated confidence score. Specifically, we use language like 'Given your X% uncertainty in step 1 and Y% uncertainty in step 2, reason about step 3 and provide your confidence...' to chain the reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UPC against standard few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting on multi-step reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH, focusing on both task performance and uncertainty calibration metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE) and Brier score."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Cascading: Improving Confidence Calibration in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty, especially for complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This issue can lead to overconfident incorrect predictions or underconfident correct predictions, both of which can be problematic in real-world applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning do not explicitly account for uncertainty accumulation in multi-step reasoning. Inspired by error propagation in scientific calculations, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling uncertainty at each reasoning step and propagating it through the chain can lead to more accurate final uncertainty estimates. This approach could potentially improve both the accuracy and the calibration of language models on complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Cascading (UPC), which decomposes complex tasks into a series of sub-prompts. For each sub-prompt, the model is asked to provide both an answer and an uncertainty estimate. Subsequent prompts incorporate previous uncertainties, gradually building a comprehensive uncertainty profile. The final prompt aggregates all uncertainties to produce a calibrated confidence score. Specifically, we use language like 'Given your X% uncertainty in step 1 and Y% uncertainty in step 2, reason about step 3 and provide your confidence...' to chain the reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: GSM8K for mathematical reasoning and MATH for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. Both datasets contain multi-step reasoning problems, making them suitable for our uncertainty propagation approach.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: simply ask the model to solve the problem and provide a confidence score. (2) Few-shot prompting: provide a few examples of solved problems before asking the model to solve a new one and provide a confidence score. (3) Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: ask the model to show its work step-by-step and provide a final confidence score.",
            "Step 3: UPC Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Cascading method. This involves: (1) Decomposing each problem into sub-steps. (2) For each sub-step, prompting the model to provide an answer and an uncertainty estimate. (3) Incorporating previous uncertainties into subsequent prompts. (4) Aggregating uncertainties in the final prompt to produce a calibrated confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo to assess how the method performs with a less capable model.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each method and model, we will evaluate: (1) Task performance: accuracy on the GSM8K and MATH datasets. (2) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score. (3) Uncertainty quality: analyze the correlation between model uncertainty and correctness of answers.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis of the results, including: (1) Comparison of UPC against baselines in terms of task performance and calibration. (2) Analysis of how uncertainty propagates through the reasoning steps. (3) Investigation of cases where UPC significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Also, provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The average speed of the train is 60 miles per hour. To calculate this, I divided the distance (120 miles) by the time (2 hours). I am 95% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPC; Step 1)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Let's break this down step by step. Step 1: What is the formula for average speed? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPC; Step 1)": "The formula for average speed is: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time. I am 98% confident in this formula.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPC; Step 2)": "Given your 98% confidence in the formula from step 1, let's move to step 2: What are the values we need to plug into this formula based on the problem statement? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPC; Step 2)": "We need to plug in: Total Distance = 120 miles, Total Time = 2 hours. I am 100% confident in these values as they are directly stated in the problem.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPC; Step 3)": "Given your 98% confidence in the formula and 100% confidence in the values, let's move to step 3: Calculate the average speed by plugging the values into the formula. Provide your answer and your overall confidence level (0-100%), taking into account the uncertainties from previous steps.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPC; Step 3)": "Plugging the values into the formula: Average Speed = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour. Taking into account the very high confidence in both the formula and the values, my overall confidence in this final answer is 98%.",
            "Explanation": "The UPC method provides a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence estimate by considering uncertainties at each step of the reasoning process. In this case, the slight uncertainty in the formula (98% confidence) propagated to the final answer, resulting in a 98% overall confidence instead of the 95% given in the direct prompting baseline."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UPC method doesn't significantly improve calibration or task performance, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Analyze why UPC fails to improve calibration. This could involve a detailed examination of how uncertainty propagates through the reasoning chain and where it breaks down. (2) Experiment with different ways of aggregating uncertainties in the final step. For example, we could try weighted averages or more complex probabilistic models. (3) Investigate how the decomposition of problems into sub-steps affects the final uncertainty estimate. We could compare different decomposition strategies and their impact on calibration. (4) Explore how UPC performs on different types of reasoning tasks beyond mathematics, such as logical reasoning or causal inference problems. This could provide insights into the generalizability of the method. (5) Combine UPC with other prompting techniques like self-consistency or majority voting to see if we can further improve calibration. These analyses could lead to valuable insights about uncertainty estimation in language models, even if the original hypothesis isn't fully supported."
