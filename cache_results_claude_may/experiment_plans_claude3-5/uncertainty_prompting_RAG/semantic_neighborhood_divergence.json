        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often fail to capture the semantic nuances and contextual variations that can significantly impact model confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches focus on token-level probabilities or direct confidence scoring, which may not fully capture semantic-level uncertainties.",
        "Motivation": "The certainty of a model's output often depends on the stability of its meaning across slight variations in wording or context. By exploring this semantic neighborhood, we might be able to obtain a more robust and nuanced measure of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Divergence (SND), a prompting technique that estimates uncertainty by exploring variations in the semantic neighborhood of the model's output. The method involves generating multiple semantically similar but distinct phrasings of the model's initial response. These variations are created through carefully designed prompts that encourage the model to rephrase its answer while preserving the core meaning. The model is then asked to compare these variations, identifying any divergences in meaning or implications. The uncertainty estimate is derived from the degree of semantic divergence observed across these variations. A high degree of divergence indicates greater uncertainty, as it suggests the model's understanding is sensitive to small changes in phrasing. Conversely, semantic stability across variations indicates higher confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SND on a variety of tasks, including open-ended generation, summarization, and complex reasoning problems. We'll compare it to traditional uncertainty estimation methods, assessing not only the calibration of the uncertainty estimates but also their robustness across different phrasings of the same query and the insights they provide into the model's semantic understanding."

        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Divergence: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Contextual Variations",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often fail to capture the semantic nuances and contextual variations that can significantly impact model confidence. This limitation leads to unreliable confidence estimates, particularly in complex reasoning tasks or when dealing with ambiguous inputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches primarily focus on token-level probabilities or direct confidence scoring, which may not fully capture semantic-level uncertainties. The certainty of a model's output often depends on the stability of its meaning across slight variations in wording or context. By exploring this semantic neighborhood, we might be able to obtain a more robust and nuanced measure of uncertainty. This method could provide deeper insights into the model's understanding and confidence across different phrasings of the same underlying concept.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Divergence (SND), a prompting technique that estimates uncertainty by exploring variations in the semantic neighborhood of the model's output. The method involves the following steps: 1) Generate an initial response to the input query. 2) Create multiple semantically similar but distinct phrasings of the model's initial response using carefully designed prompts. 3) Ask the model to compare these variations, identifying any divergences in meaning or implications. 4) Derive an uncertainty estimate from the degree of semantic divergence observed across these variations. A high degree of divergence indicates greater uncertainty, as it suggests the model's understanding is sensitive to small changes in phrasing. Conversely, semantic stability across variations indicates higher confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate SND across different task types: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, 2) CNN/Daily Mail for summarization, and 3) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Token-level probability: Use the average token probability of the generated sequence as an uncertainty measure. 2) Direct confidence scoring: Prompt the model to provide a confidence score for its answer on a scale of 1-10.",
            "Step 3: SND Implementation": "Implement the SND method with the following sub-steps: a) Generate initial response. b) Create semantic variations (use 3-5 variations). c) Compare variations. d) Calculate divergence score.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of SND. For example: a) Initial response: 'Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Semantic variations: 'Rephrase the following answer in 3 different ways while preserving the core meaning: [INITIAL_ANSWER]' c) Comparison: 'Compare the following statements and identify any differences in meaning or implications: [VARIATIONS]' d) Divergence scoring: 'On a scale of 0-100, how much do these statements diverge in meaning? Provide a brief explanation for your score.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "For each dataset and model: a) Generate answers and uncertainty estimates using baselines and SND. b) For TruthfulQA and MATH, compare uncertainty estimates with ground truth correctness. c) For CNN/Daily Mail, use human evaluation to judge summary quality and compare with uncertainty estimates. d) Calculate correlation between uncertainty estimates and actual performance.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare SND performance against baselines across different tasks. b) Analyze cases where SND significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. c) Investigate the relationship between semantic divergence and task difficulty or ambiguity."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output (Token Probability Method)": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Uncertainty: 0.05 (based on average token probability)",
                "Output (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 9/10"
            },
            "SND Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 1 (Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
                "Step 2 (Semantic Variations)": "1. Paris serves as the capital city of France. 2. France's capital is the city of Paris. 3. The French capital is Paris.",
                "Step 3 (Comparison)": "These statements are semantically equivalent. They all convey that Paris is the capital of France, with only minor differences in phrasing.",
                "Step 4 (Divergence Scoring)": "Divergence Score: 5/100. Explanation: The statements have very low divergence as they all convey the same core information with only slight variations in wording.",
                "Final Output": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Uncertainty: 0.05 (based on semantic neighborhood divergence)"
            },
            "Explanation": "In this example, both baseline methods and SND show high confidence/low uncertainty, which is appropriate for this factual question. However, SND provides a more nuanced assessment by considering semantic stability across variations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SND does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality and diversity of generated semantic variations - are they truly exploring the semantic neighborhood effectively? 2) The model's ability to compare and identify semantic differences - is it too lenient or too strict? 3) The relationship between semantic stability and actual uncertainty - are there cases where high divergence doesn't correlate with uncertainty? This analysis could lead to insights about the nature of semantic understanding in LLMs and how it relates to confidence and uncertainty. We could also explore combining SND with other uncertainty estimation methods, potentially creating a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple techniques."
