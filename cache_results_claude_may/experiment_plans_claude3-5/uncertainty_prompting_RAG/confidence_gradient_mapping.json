        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often rely on single-point estimates, failing to capture the nuanced landscape of model confidence across different inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like entropy of output distributions or model ensembling to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by optimization techniques in machine learning, we propose to explore the 'confidence landscape' of language models by probing the model's responses to small perturbations in the input space.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Gradient Mapping (CGM), a novel prompting method that systematically perturbs the input prompt along multiple dimensions (e.g., semantic, syntactic, stylistic) and measures the corresponding changes in the model's confidence. The method involves: 1) Generating a set of perturbed prompts using controlled text transformations. 2) Querying the model with these perturbed prompts and extracting confidence scores. 3) Constructing a multi-dimensional confidence gradient map. 4) Using this map to identify regions of high uncertainty or inconsistency in the model's responses. The final confidence estimate is derived from the properties of this gradient map, such as its smoothness or the presence of sharp transitions.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CGM against baselines like entropy-based uncertainty and ensemble methods on tasks such as question answering and fact verification. Measure performance using metrics like calibration error and uncertainty-aware accuracy on datasets like TruthfulQA and SQuAD."

        "Title": "Confidence Gradient Mapping: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Dimensional Input Perturbations",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often rely on single-point estimates, failing to capture the nuanced landscape of model confidence across different inputs. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions in areas of high uncertainty, potentially resulting in unreliable or misleading outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like entropy of output distributions or model ensembling to estimate uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the full complexity of the model's confidence landscape. Inspired by optimization techniques in machine learning, we propose to explore the 'confidence landscape' of language models by probing the model's responses to small perturbations in the input space. This approach allows us to map out regions of high and low confidence, providing a more comprehensive view of model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Gradient Mapping (CGM), a novel prompting method that systematically perturbs the input prompt along multiple dimensions (e.g., semantic, syntactic, stylistic) and measures the corresponding changes in the model's confidence. The method involves four main steps: 1) Generating a set of perturbed prompts using controlled text transformations. 2) Querying the model with these perturbed prompts and extracting confidence scores. 3) Constructing a multi-dimensional confidence gradient map. 4) Using this map to identify regions of high uncertainty or inconsistency in the model's responses. The final confidence estimate is derived from the properties of this gradient map, such as its smoothness or the presence of sharp transitions.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: TruthfulQA for question answering and SQuAD for fact verification. These datasets provide a good mix of open-ended and factual questions to test our method across different types of tasks.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Entropy-based uncertainty: Calculate the entropy of the output token distribution. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple API calls with different temperatures to create an ensemble and calculate the variance of predictions.",
            "Step 4: CGM Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Gradient Mapping method with the following sub-steps: a) Generate perturbed prompts: Create a function that takes an input prompt and generates multiple perturbed versions along semantic, syntactic, and stylistic dimensions. b) Query model: Send the original and perturbed prompts to the LLM API and collect the responses along with their confidence scores. c) Construct gradient map: Create a multi-dimensional map of how confidence changes with different perturbations. d) Analyze gradient map: Implement functions to calculate properties of the gradient map, such as smoothness and presence of sharp transitions.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate CGM against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Measure how well the confidence estimates align with actual performance. 2) Uncertainty-aware accuracy: Assess how well the method identifies truly uncertain predictions. 3) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the method's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect predictions based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform additional analyses to gain insights into the method's performance: 1) Visualize confidence landscapes for different types of questions. 2) Analyze how different perturbation types affect confidence estimates. 3) Investigate cases where CGM significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Entropy-based Output": "Paris (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "Ensemble Output": "Paris (Confidence: 0.92)",
                "Explanation": "Baselines provide high confidence for this simple factual question, but may not capture nuanced uncertainty."
            },
            "CGM Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Perturbed Prompts": [
                    "Q: What's the capital city of France?",
                    "Q: Which city serves as the capital of France?",
                    "Q: France's capital is which city?",
                    "Q: The capital of France is located where?"
                ],
                "CGM Output": "Paris (Confidence: 0.98, Gradient Smoothness: 0.99)",
                "Explanation": "CGM provides high confidence with smooth gradients across perturbations, indicating high certainty."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CGM doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why certain perturbations affect model confidence more than others. We could investigate patterns in the confidence landscape across different question types or model sizes. Additionally, we could explore combining CGM with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as using it to improve ensemble diversity. Another direction could be to use the confidence gradients to generate adversarial examples that maximize uncertainty, potentially revealing vulnerabilities in the model's knowledge or reasoning capabilities."
