        "Problem": "Few-shot learning with large language models often leads to overconfident predictions on examples dissimilar to the provided demonstrations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Traditional few-shot learning focuses on accuracy without explicitly addressing confidence calibration.",
        "Motivation": "By incorporating confidence calibration directly into the few-shot learning process, we can improve model uncertainty estimates on diverse inputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence-Calibrated Few-Shot Learning (CCFSL), which augments standard few-shot prompts with calibration-oriented demonstrations. In addition to task examples, CCFSL includes carefully crafted scenarios where the model should express low, medium, and high confidence. These calibration examples span various uncertainty sources (e.g., ambiguity, lack of information, conflicting evidence) and are dynamically generated to match the target task. The prompt instructs the model to reason about its confidence level for each new input, referencing the calibration examples as anchor points.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CCFSL to standard few-shot learning across multiple tasks and model sizes. Evaluate improvements in confidence calibration, selective prediction, and out-of-distribution detection. Analyze the impact of different types and quantities of calibration examples."

        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Few-Shot Learning: Improving Uncertainty Estimates in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Few-shot learning with large language models often leads to overconfident predictions on examples dissimilar to the provided demonstrations. This overconfidence can result in unreliable model outputs and poor decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Traditional few-shot learning focuses on accuracy without explicitly addressing confidence calibration. By incorporating confidence calibration directly into the few-shot learning process, we can improve model uncertainty estimates on diverse inputs. This is crucial for real-world applications where understanding the model's confidence is as important as its predictions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence-Calibrated Few-Shot Learning (CCFSL), which augments standard few-shot prompts with calibration-oriented demonstrations. In addition to task examples, CCFSL includes carefully crafted scenarios where the model should express low, medium, and high confidence. These calibration examples span various uncertainty sources (e.g., ambiguity, lack of information, conflicting evidence) and are dynamically generated to match the target task. The prompt instructs the model to reason about its confidence level for each new input, referencing the calibration examples as anchor points.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets that cover different domains and task types. We will use: (1) MNLI for natural language inference, (2) SQuAD for question answering, and (3) AGNews for text classification.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard few-shot learning baselines: (a) Direct few-shot: Include 3-5 task-specific examples without confidence calibration. (b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) few-shot: Include 3-5 task-specific examples with reasoning steps but no explicit confidence calibration.",
            "Step 3: CCFSL Implementation": "Develop the CCFSL prompt structure: (a) Task description. (b) 3-5 task-specific examples. (c) 3 calibration examples (low, medium, high confidence). (d) Instructions for confidence reasoning. (e) New input query.",
            "Step 4: Calibration Example Generation": "For each dataset, create a set of calibration examples: (a) Low confidence: Ambiguous or out-of-domain questions. (b) Medium confidence: Partially relevant or incomplete information. (c) High confidence: Clear-cut cases with sufficient information.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for main experiments. Include Claude API as an additional model for robustness checks.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: (a) Run baseline methods (direct few-shot and CoT few-shot). (b) Run CCFSL with different sets of calibration examples. (c) Collect model outputs, including predictions and confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement and calculate: (a) Accuracy: Measure prediction correctness. (b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Assess overall calibration. (c) Brier Score: Evaluate probabilistic predictions. (d) Selective Prediction Performance: Accuracy vs. coverage trade-off.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "(a) Compare CCFSL performance against baselines across different datasets and models. (b) Analyze the impact of different calibration example types on model performance. (c) Investigate how CCFSL affects out-of-distribution detection. (d) Examine qualitative examples to understand how CCFSL influences model reasoning."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Few-Shot)": "Task: Determine if the second sentence is an entailment, contradiction, or neutral with respect to the first sentence.\n\nExample 1:\nSentence 1: The cat is sleeping on the couch.\nSentence 2: The cat is awake and playing.\nLabel: Contradiction\n\nExample 2:\nSentence 1: The sun is shining brightly today.\nSentence 2: It's a beautiful day outside.\nLabel: Neutral\n\nExample 3:\nSentence 1: All dogs are mammals.\nSentence 2: My pet dog is a mammal.\nLabel: Entailment\n\nNow, classify the following:\nSentence 1: The restaurant was crowded and noisy.\nSentence 2: Many people were dining at the restaurant.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Few-Shot)": "Label: Entailment",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCFSL)": "Task: Determine if the second sentence is an entailment, contradiction, or neutral with respect to the first sentence. Also provide a confidence level (low, medium, or high) for your answer.\n\nExample 1:\nSentence 1: The cat is sleeping on the couch.\nSentence 2: The cat is awake and playing.\nLabel: Contradiction\nConfidence: High\n\nExample 2:\nSentence 1: The sun is shining brightly today.\nSentence 2: It's a beautiful day outside.\nLabel: Neutral\nConfidence: Medium\n\nExample 3:\nSentence 1: All dogs are mammals.\nSentence 2: My pet dog is a mammal.\nLabel: Entailment\nConfidence: High\n\nCalibration Examples:\nLow Confidence Example:\nSentence 1: The quantum fluctuations affected the experiment results.\nSentence 2: The scientists adjusted their methodology.\nExplanation: Without specific expertise in quantum physics and the details of the experiment, it's difficult to determine the relationship between these sentences. The level of technical knowledge required makes this a low confidence scenario.\n\nMedium Confidence Example:\nSentence 1: The company's stock price increased yesterday.\nSentence 2: The company reported better than expected earnings.\nExplanation: While there's a plausible connection between these statements, we can't be certain without more context. Stock prices can be influenced by many factors, so this is a medium confidence scenario.\n\nHigh Confidence Example:\nSentence 1: Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level.\nSentence 2: If you heat water to 100 degrees Celsius at sea level, it will boil.\nExplanation: This is a well-established scientific fact with a clear logical relationship between the sentences, warranting high confidence.\n\nNow, classify the following and explain your confidence level:\nSentence 1: The restaurant was crowded and noisy.\nSentence 2: Many people were dining at the restaurant.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCFSL)": "Label: Entailment\nConfidence: High\nExplanation: The second sentence directly follows from the first. If a restaurant is crowded, it logically implies that many people are dining there. The 'noisy' part of the first sentence isn't directly addressed in the second, but it doesn't contradict it either. Given the clear logical connection between 'crowded' and 'many people dining', we can be highly confident in this entailment relationship.",
            "Explanation": "The CCFSL prompt improves upon the baseline by explicitly asking for a confidence level and providing calibration examples. This allows the model to reason about its uncertainty and provide a more nuanced response. The output now includes not just the label, but also a confidence level and an explanation for that confidence, which gives us more insight into the model's reasoning process and the reliability of its prediction."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCFSL doesn't significantly improve calibration or uncertainty estimates, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why CCFSL fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about their own uncertainty. 2) Experiment with different structures for calibration examples, such as using more domain-specific scenarios or varying the number of examples. 3) Explore combining CCFSL with other techniques like temperature scaling or ensemble methods to see if hybrid approaches yield better results. 4) Investigate whether CCFSL has different effects on various types of tasks (e.g., classification vs. generation) or domains, which could lead to task-specific calibration strategies. 5) Analyze the generated explanations for confidence levels to gain insights into how LLMs reason about uncertainty, potentially informing future model improvements or training strategies."
