    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide fine-grained confidence estimates that accurately reflect their certainty at different levels of abstraction within a given response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on global confidence scores or token-level probabilities, which may not capture the hierarchical nature of confidence in complex responses.",
        "Motivation": "Fractal geometry, where patterns are repeated at different scales, can inspire a method to map confidence across multiple levels of abstraction in LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Fractal Confidence Mapping (FCM), a multi-stage prompting technique that recursively decomposes responses and assesses confidence at each level. The process begins with a high-level response, then prompts the model to break it down into sub-components, sub-sub-components, and so on, assigning confidence scores at each level. The prompt structure is: 'Decompose the following statement into its key components and assign a confidence score (0-100) to each: [STATEMENT].' This process is repeated for each component until atomic statements are reached. The result is a tree-like structure of confidence scores that captures uncertainty at multiple scales.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate FCM against baseline confidence estimation methods on tasks requiring multi-level reasoning, such as complex problem-solving or long-form text generation. Assess the method's ability to identify areas of high and low confidence at different levels of abstraction."

        "Title": "Fractal Confidence Mapping: A Multi-Level Approach to Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide fine-grained confidence estimates that accurately reflect their certainty at different levels of abstraction within a given response. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs, especially in complex reasoning tasks or long-form text generation.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically focus on global confidence scores or token-level probabilities, which may not capture the hierarchical nature of confidence in complex responses. Fractal geometry, where patterns are repeated at different scales, inspires our method to map confidence across multiple levels of abstraction in LLM outputs. This approach could provide a more nuanced and accurate representation of model uncertainty, potentially improving the reliability and interpretability of LLM-generated content.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Fractal Confidence Mapping (FCM), a multi-stage prompting technique that recursively decomposes responses and assesses confidence at each level. The process begins with a high-level response, then prompts the model to break it down into sub-components, sub-sub-components, and so on, assigning confidence scores at each level. The core prompt structure is: 'Decompose the following statement into its key components and assign a confidence score (0-100) to each: [STATEMENT].' This process is repeated for each component until atomic statements are reached, resulting in a tree-like structure of confidence scores that captures uncertainty at multiple scales.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate FCM: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, (2) GSM8K for multi-step mathematical reasoning, and (3) CommonGen for open-ended text generation. These datasets cover a range of task complexities and abstraction levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline confidence estimation methods: (1) Global confidence scoring: prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for the entire response. (2) Token-level probability: use the model's output probabilities for each token as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: FCM Implementation": "Implement the Fractal Confidence Mapping method using the following steps: a) Generate an initial response to the input prompt. b) Apply the decomposition prompt recursively, starting with the full response and then to each sub-component. c) Assign confidence scores at each level of decomposition. d) Create a tree-like structure to represent the multi-level confidence mapping.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error: compare model confidence to actual performance. b) Spearman's rank correlation: between confidence scores and human judgments of correctness. c) Hierarchical consistency: measure how well the confidence scores at different levels align.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (50 samples per dataset) to judge the correctness of model outputs and the reasonableness of the confidence estimates at different levels.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare FCM against the baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze how FCM performs across different task types and complexity levels. Investigate cases where FCM significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Global Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Global Confidence)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Token-level Probability)": "What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Token-level Probability)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FCM; Level 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer, then decompose it into key components and assign a confidence score (0-100) to each.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FCM; Level 1)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nDecomposition:\n1. France is a country (Confidence: 100)\n2. Paris is a city (Confidence: 100)\n3. Paris is the capital of France (Confidence: 98)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FCM; Level 2)": "Decompose the statement 'Paris is the capital of France' into its key components and assign a confidence score (0-100) to each:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FCM; Level 2)": "1. Paris exists as a city (Confidence: 100)\n2. France exists as a country (Confidence: 100)\n3. France has a designated capital city (Confidence: 99)\n4. Paris holds the status of capital city in France (Confidence: 98)\n5. This status is current and officially recognized (Confidence: 97)",
            "explanation": "FCM provides a more nuanced confidence assessment compared to global or token-level methods. It breaks down the statement into increasingly granular components, allowing for identification of specific areas of uncertainty within the model's knowledge."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If FCM does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the patterns of confidence distribution across different levels of abstraction to gain insights into how LLMs structure their knowledge and uncertainty. 2) Investigate whether certain types of tasks or domains benefit more from hierarchical confidence mapping than others. 3) Explore how FCM can be used as a tool for model interpretability, by identifying which specific sub-components of a response contribute most to overall uncertainty. 4) Develop a hybrid approach that combines FCM with other confidence estimation techniques to leverage the strengths of each method. 5) Use the hierarchical confidence structure to guide targeted fact-checking or information retrieval, focusing on the least confident branches of the decomposition tree."
