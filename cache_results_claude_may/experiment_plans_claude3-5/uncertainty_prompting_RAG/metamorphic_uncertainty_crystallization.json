    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially for complex, multi-faceted queries where uncertainty may manifest in different ways across various aspects of the response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on global uncertainty estimates or simple decompositions of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "In nature, crystals form through a process of nucleation and growth, with their final structure revealing information about the conditions under which they formed. By analogously 'crystallizing' uncertainty through a series of transformations, we may be able to reveal more nuanced and structured uncertainty information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metamorphic Uncertainty Crystallization (MUC), a prompting technique that guides the model through a series of 'phase transitions' in its reasoning process, each crystallizing different aspects of uncertainty. The process begins with a 'supersaturated' prompt that intentionally overwhelms the model with information and possibilities. Through carefully designed prompts, the model is then guided through several 'phase transitions': 1) Nucleation: Identifying key points of uncertainty. 2) Growth: Expanding on these uncertainties, exploring their implications. 3) Annealing: Refining and stabilizing uncertainty estimates. 4) Faceting: Structuring uncertainties into distinct, interrelated aspects. 5) Twinning: Exploring how different uncertainty 'crystals' interact and influence each other. The final uncertainty quantification is derived from analyzing the resulting 'crystal structure' of uncertainties, including its symmetries, defects, and overall geometry.",

Develop new evaluation metrics that assess the structure and interrelationships of the produced uncertainty estimates, not just their overall calibration."

        "Title": "Metamorphic Uncertainty Crystallization: Structured Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially for complex, multi-faceted queries where uncertainty may manifest in different ways across various aspects of the response. Current approaches typically focus on global uncertainty estimates or simple decompositions of uncertainty, which fail to capture the nuanced and structured nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the process of crystal formation in nature, where the final structure reveals information about the conditions under which they formed, we propose a method to 'crystallize' uncertainty through a series of transformations. This approach aims to reveal more nuanced and structured uncertainty information, potentially leading to better-calibrated and more interpretable uncertainty estimates for large language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metamorphic Uncertainty Crystallization (MUC), a prompting technique that guides the model through a series of 'phase transitions' in its reasoning process, each crystallizing different aspects of uncertainty.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of complex, multi-faceted queries from existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, AmbigQA, and MultiNLI. We will also create a custom dataset of 100 complex queries that require multi-faceted reasoning and are likely to induce structured uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement existing uncertainty quantification methods as baselines: 1) Monte Carlo Dropout, 2) Deep Ensembles, 3) Temperature Scaling, 4) Calibrated Few-Shot prompting.",
            "Step 3: MUC Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each phase of the MUC process. For example:\n1) Supersaturation: 'Consider all possible aspects and interpretations of the following query: [QUERY]'\n2) Nucleation: 'Identify the key points of uncertainty in your understanding or ability to answer this query.'\n3) Growth: 'For each point of uncertainty, explore its implications and potential impacts on the answer.'\n4) Annealing: 'Refine and stabilize your uncertainty estimates by considering additional context or knowledge.'\n5) Faceting: 'Structure the uncertainties into distinct, interrelated aspects.'\n6) Twinning: 'Explore how different uncertainty aspects interact and influence each other.'",
            "Step 4: MUC Implementation": "Implement the MUC process using GPT-4 API. For each query, apply the designed prompts sequentially, storing the intermediate outputs at each phase.",
            "Step 5: Uncertainty Quantification": "Develop an algorithm to analyze the final 'crystal structure' of uncertainties produced by MUC. This should include measures of symmetry, complexity, and interconnectedness of the uncertainty structure.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement both traditional and novel evaluation metrics:\n1) Traditional: Calibration error, Brier score, and log-likelihood.\n2) Novel: Uncertainty structure complexity score, Aspect coverage score, Inter-aspect consistency score.",
            "Step 7: Experiments": "Run experiments comparing MUC against baseline methods on the prepared datasets. For each method and dataset:\n1) Generate uncertainty estimates for all queries.\n2) Compute all evaluation metrics.\n3) Perform statistical significance tests to compare MUC with baselines.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results:\n1) Compare performance across different types of queries and uncertainty structures.\n2) Analyze the evolution of uncertainty estimates through the MUC phases.\n3) Identify patterns in the uncertainty 'crystal structures' that correlate with better calibration or performance.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each MUC phase:\n1) Remove each phase one at a time and evaluate performance.\n2) Vary the order of phases to test the importance of the sequence.",
            "Step 10: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the interpretability and usefulness of MUC's structured uncertainty outputs compared to baseline methods."

            "explanation": "The MUC method provides a more structured and nuanced representation of uncertainty compared to the baseline. It breaks down the complex question into distinct aspects, explores their implications, and shows how these uncertainties interact.

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUC method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration or our novel metrics, we can pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of how different types of queries and reasoning tasks lead to different uncertainty structures. We could categorize queries based on their complexity, domain, and the type of reasoning required, and analyze how these factors influence the uncertainty 'crystal structures' produced by MUC. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty in language models and how it varies across different types of tasks. Additionally, we could explore how the intermediate outputs at each phase of MUC correlate with final performance, potentially identifying key 'crystallization' patterns that are indicative of well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This could lead to the development of new metrics for assessing the quality of uncertainty estimates in language models, even if the overall calibration doesn't improve significantly."
