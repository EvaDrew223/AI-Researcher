    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when faced with novel or complex scenarios that require combining multiple concepts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct prompting for confidence scores or use ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Conceptual blending, a cognitive process where humans combine familiar concepts to understand new ideas, could be leveraged to explore the model's uncertainty in novel scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a prompting technique that guides the model to blend relevant concepts from its knowledge base to analyze a given query. The prompt first asks the model to identify key concepts in the query, then instructs it to blend these concepts in various ways, generating multiple perspectives. For each blended perspective, the model is asked to provide a confidence score and reasoning. The diversity and coherence of these blended perspectives are then used to quantify overall uncertainty. Prompts include: '1. Identify key concepts in the query. 2. Create 3 unique conceptual blends using these concepts. 3. For each blend, provide an answer, confidence score, and reasoning. 4. Analyze the diversity and coherence of your blends to estimate overall uncertainty.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare this method against standard confidence estimation techniques on a range of tasks, including novel concept understanding and complex reasoning problems. Evaluate using calibration metrics and correlation with human judgments of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Conceptual Blending for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when faced with novel or complex scenarios that require combining multiple concepts. This issue can lead to overconfident predictions in unfamiliar situations, potentially resulting in misinformation or unreliable decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct prompting for confidence scores or use ensemble methods. However, these methods may not effectively capture the model's uncertainty in novel scenarios that require combining multiple concepts. Conceptual blending, a cognitive process where humans combine familiar concepts to understand new ideas, could be leveraged to explore the model's uncertainty in such scenarios. By guiding the model to blend relevant concepts and analyze its own blending process, we can potentially obtain a more nuanced understanding of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a prompting technique called Conceptual Blending for Uncertainty Quantification (CBUQ). This method guides the model to blend relevant concepts from its knowledge base to analyze a given query. The process involves four main steps: 1) Identify key concepts in the query, 2) Create multiple unique conceptual blends using these concepts, 3) Provide an answer, confidence score, and reasoning for each blend, and 4) Analyze the diversity and coherence of the blends to estimate overall uncertainty. The prompt structure is as follows: '1. Identify key concepts in the query. 2. Create 3 unique conceptual blends using these concepts. 3. For each blend, provide an answer, confidence score (0-100), and reasoning. 4. Analyze the diversity and coherence of your blends to estimate overall uncertainty (0-100).'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of existing datasets and create a new dataset specifically for testing conceptual blending and uncertainty quantification. Existing datasets include: a) TruthfulQA for assessing factual accuracy, b) ARC-Challenge for complex reasoning, and c) BIG-bench for diverse tasks. We will also create a new dataset called NovelBlend, consisting of 1000 questions that require combining multiple concepts in novel ways.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. b) Ensemble method: Use 5 different prompts for each question and aggregate the results. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout during inference and collect multiple predictions.",
            "Step 3: CBUQ Implementation": "Implement the CBUQ method using the following prompt structure for each question: 'Q: [question] 1. Identify key concepts in the query. 2. Create 3 unique conceptual blends using these concepts. 3. For each blend, provide an answer, confidence score (0-100), and reasoning. 4. Analyze the diversity and coherence of your blends to estimate overall uncertainty (0-100).'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. b) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. c) Uncertainty Quality: Measure the correlation between the model's uncertainty estimates and its error rates. d) Blend Diversity: Quantify the diversity of the generated conceptual blends using semantic similarity measures.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation on a subset of 100 questions from the NovelBlend dataset. Human evaluators will rate the quality of the conceptual blends, the reasonableness of the uncertainty estimates, and the overall coherence of the reasoning process.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the CBUQ method: a) Vary the number of conceptual blends (1, 3, 5). b) Remove the diversity analysis step. c) Use different prompts for generating conceptual blends.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the results to answer the following questions: a) How does CBUQ compare to baseline methods in terms of accuracy and calibration? b) Does CBUQ provide better uncertainty estimates for novel and complex questions? c) How does the quality of conceptual blends correlate with the accuracy of answers and uncertainty estimates? d) Are there specific types of questions where CBUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines?"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: How would a combination of quantum computing and photosynthesis potentially impact energy production? Please provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Answer: A combination of quantum computing and photosynthesis could potentially revolutionize energy production by optimizing artificial photosynthesis processes. Quantum computers could simulate complex molecular interactions in photosynthesis more accurately than classical computers, leading to the design of more efficient artificial photosynthetic systems. This could result in improved solar energy capture and conversion, potentially increasing the efficiency of solar cells or creating new methods of directly converting sunlight into storable fuels. However, this is still a highly speculative field, and practical applications are likely many years away. Confidence score: 70",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBUQ)": "Q: How would a combination of quantum computing and photosynthesis potentially impact energy production? 1. Identify key concepts in the query. 2. Create 3 unique conceptual blends using these concepts. 3. For each blend, provide an answer, confidence score (0-100), and reasoning. 4. Analyze the diversity and coherence of your blends to estimate overall uncertainty (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBUQ)": "1. Key concepts: quantum computing, photosynthesis, energy production\n\n2. Conceptual blends:\na) Quantum Photosynthetic Algorithms\nb) Entangled Chloroplast Networks\nc) Superposition Solar Cells\n\n3. Answers, confidence scores, and reasoning:\n\na) Quantum Photosynthetic Algorithms\nAnswer: Quantum computers could optimize photosynthetic processes by simulating and improving light-harvesting complexes, leading to more efficient artificial photosynthesis for energy production.\nConfidence: 85\nReasoning: This blend directly combines quantum computing's simulation capabilities with photosynthesis optimization, which is a plausible and actively researched area.\n\nb) Entangled Chloroplast Networks\nAnswer: Creating networks of entangled artificial chloroplasts could allow for instantaneous energy transfer across large areas, potentially revolutionizing energy distribution.\nConfidence: 40\nReasoning: While entanglement is a quantum phenomenon, applying it to macroscopic chloroplast networks is highly speculative and may not be physically feasible.\n\nc) Superposition Solar Cells\nAnswer: Developing solar cells that utilize quantum superposition could allow for the simultaneous absorption of multiple light wavelengths, dramatically increasing energy capture efficiency.\nConfidence: 60\nReasoning: This blend applies quantum principles to solar cell design, which is being explored in quantum dot solar cells, but achieving macroscopic superposition remains challenging.\n\n4. Analysis of diversity and coherence:\nThe conceptual blends show good diversity, ranging from algorithmic approaches to novel physical structures. They all coherently combine aspects of quantum computing and photosynthesis for energy production. However, the speculative nature of some blends and the varying confidence scores indicate significant uncertainty in predicting the exact impact of combining these fields.\n\nOverall uncertainty estimate: 70\n\nThis uncertainty reflects the innovative potential of combining quantum computing and photosynthesis for energy production, balanced against the speculative nature of some applications and the technical challenges involved in realizing these concepts.",
            "explanation": "The CBUQ method provides a more nuanced exploration of the potential impacts by generating diverse conceptual blends. It explicitly considers the uncertainty associated with each blend and provides an overall uncertainty estimate based on the diversity and coherence of the blends. This approach allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the speculative nature of combining quantum computing and photosynthesis, potentially leading to a more accurate assessment of uncertainty compared to the direct prompting method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CBUQ method does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated conceptual blends to understand why they may not be contributing to better uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing the types of blends produced and their relationship to answer accuracy and uncertainty. 2) Explore variations of the CBUQ method, such as iterative blending where the model refines its blends based on initial uncertainty estimates, or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide the blending process. 3) Investigate whether CBUQ performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when conceptual blending is most effective for uncertainty quantification. 4) Analyze the relationship between the diversity of conceptual blends and the model's performance, which could provide insights into the model's knowledge representation and reasoning processes. 5) If the method shows promise but struggles with consistency, we could explore ways to make the blending process more structured, perhaps by defining a set of blending operators or templates that the model can use."
