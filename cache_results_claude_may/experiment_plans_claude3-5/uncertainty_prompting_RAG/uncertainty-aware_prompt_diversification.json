        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to capture the full range of possible interpretations or solutions for ambiguous or open-ended queries, leading to overconfident and narrow responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-path reasoning or limited sampling strategies for uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting for diverse interpretations and solutions, we can better capture the inherent uncertainty in many real-world tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Diversification (UAPD), a method that systematically generates a diverse set of prompts for a given query. UAPD uses a two-stage process: 1) Interpretation Generation: The LLM is prompted to generate multiple possible interpretations of the query, each with an associated confidence score. 2) Solution Exploration: For each interpretation, the LLM generates multiple solution paths, again with confidence scores. The prompts are designed to encourage exploration of different assumptions, perspectives, and reasoning strategies. We then aggregate these diverse outputs using a novel uncertainty-aware fusion algorithm that considers both the diversity and confidence of the generated responses. This method allows for a more comprehensive uncertainty estimation that captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UAPD on tasks that inherently have multiple valid interpretations or solutions, such as open-ended writing, strategic planning, and ambiguous reasoning tasks. We'll compare against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods, using metrics that assess both the quality and diversity of outputs, as well as the calibration of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Diversification: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the full range of possible interpretations or solutions for ambiguous or open-ended queries, leading to overconfident and narrow responses. This limitation hinders their ability to accurately represent uncertainty in real-world tasks and can result in misleading or incomplete outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically focus on single-path reasoning or limited sampling strategies, which may not fully capture the inherent ambiguity in many tasks. By explicitly prompting for diverse interpretations and solutions, we can better represent the uncertainty space and improve the calibration of confidence estimates. This approach leverages the LLM's own capabilities to explore multiple perspectives and reasoning paths, potentially leading to more robust and well-calibrated outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Diversification (UAPD), a method that systematically generates a diverse set of prompts for a given query. UAPD uses a two-stage process: 1) Interpretation Generation: The LLM is prompted to generate multiple possible interpretations of the query, each with an associated confidence score. 2) Solution Exploration: For each interpretation, the LLM generates multiple solution paths, again with confidence scores. The prompts are designed to encourage exploration of different assumptions, perspectives, and reasoning strategies. We then aggregate these diverse outputs using a novel uncertainty-aware fusion algorithm that considers both the diversity and confidence of the generated responses.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that inherently have multiple valid interpretations or solutions. We will use: 1) AmbigQA for open-ended question answering, 2) CommonGen for diverse text generation, and 3) GSM8K for math word problems with potential multiple solution strategies.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct query), b) Few-shot prompting with 3 examples, and c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.",
            "Step 3: UAPD Implementation": "Implement the two-stage UAPD process: a) Interpretation Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 3-5 diverse interpretations of each query, with confidence scores. b) Solution Exploration: For each interpretation, prompt the LLM to generate 2-3 solution paths, with confidence scores.",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Algorithm": "Develop and implement the fusion algorithm that aggregates the diverse outputs. This will involve: a) Normalizing confidence scores, b) Calculating diversity scores between interpretations and solutions, c) Combining confidence and diversity scores to produce a final uncertainty-calibrated output.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Answer quality: task-specific metrics (e.g., F1 for QA, BLEU for generation), b) Diversity: using metrics like Self-BLEU or Distinct-n, c) Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), d) Uncertainty estimation: Brier score and proper scoring rules.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run baseline methods, b) Run UAPD method, c) Calculate all evaluation metrics, d) Repeat experiments 3 times with different random seeds for statistical significance.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: a) Compare UAPD performance against baselines, b) Analyze the diversity of interpretations and solutions generated, c) Evaluate the effectiveness of the fusion algorithm, d) Investigate how performance varies across different types of queries or tasks."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of Georgia?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of Georgia is Atlanta.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAPD; Step 1: Interpretation Generation)": "Generate 3-5 diverse interpretations of the following question, each with a confidence score (0-100): 'What is the capital of Georgia?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAPD; Step 1: Interpretation Generation)": "1. The question is asking about the U.S. state of Georgia. (Confidence: 70)\n2. The question is referring to the country of Georgia. (Confidence: 60)\n3. The question might be about historical capitals of Georgia (either state or country). (Confidence: 30)\n4. The question could be from a fictional context, like a book or movie. (Confidence: 10)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAPD; Step 2: Solution Exploration)": "For the interpretation 'The question is asking about the U.S. state of Georgia.', generate 2-3 solution paths with confidence scores (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAPD; Step 2: Solution Exploration)": "1. The capital of the U.S. state of Georgia is Atlanta. It has been the capital since 1868. (Confidence: 95)\n2. The capital of Georgia (U.S. state) is Atlanta, but it's worth noting that the state has had five different capitals throughout its history. (Confidence: 85)\n3. Atlanta is the current capital of Georgia (U.S. state), but Milledgeville was the previous capital from 1804 to 1868. (Confidence: 80)",
            "explanation": "UAPD generates multiple interpretations and solutions, capturing the inherent ambiguity in the question (state vs. country) and providing additional context (historical capitals). This approach allows for a more comprehensive and uncertainty-aware response compared to the baseline's single, potentially overconfident answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UAPD does not significantly improve performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated interpretations and solutions to understand why they didn't lead to improved performance. This could involve categorizing the types of interpretations generated and their relevance to the task. 2) Investigate the relationship between the diversity of generated outputs and task performance. We could plot diversity metrics against performance metrics to identify any patterns or thresholds. 3) Analyze the effectiveness of the confidence scores provided by the LLM. If these scores are not well-calibrated, we could explore methods to improve confidence estimation, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods. 4) Examine how UAPD performs on different subsets of the data, potentially identifying specific types of queries or tasks where it excels or struggles. This could lead to insights about when uncertainty-aware methods are most beneficial. 5) If the fusion algorithm is not effectively combining the diverse outputs, we could experiment with alternative aggregation methods, such as weighted voting or more sophisticated uncertainty propagation techniques."
