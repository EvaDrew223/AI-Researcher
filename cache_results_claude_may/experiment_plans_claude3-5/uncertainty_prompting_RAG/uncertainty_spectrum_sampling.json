    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-point estimates, which may not capture the full range of possible uncertainties across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like dropout or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty, but these can be computationally expensive and may not provide fine-grained uncertainty information.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by spectral analysis techniques in signal processing, we propose a method to sample across a spectrum of uncertainties, providing a more comprehensive view of model confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Sampling (USS), a novel prompting technique that generates a series of responses across a spectrum of confidence levels. The method involves: 1) Defining an 'uncertainty spectrum' ranging from highly certain to highly uncertain. 2) Generating multiple prompts that instruct the model to respond as if it were at different points along this spectrum. 3) Analyzing the variations in responses across the spectrum to construct a detailed uncertainty profile. For example, prompts might include 'Respond as if you're 90% certain', 'Respond as if you're 50% certain', etc. The collected responses are then analyzed for consistency, contradiction, and detail level to build a comprehensive uncertainty profile.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare USS against baseline methods like direct prompting and existing uncertainty quantification techniques on various question-answering and fact-checking datasets. Evaluate the method's ability to provide more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates, as well as its effectiveness in identifying areas of model weakness or potential misinformation."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Spectrum Sampling: A Novel Prompting Method for Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-point estimates, which may not capture the full range of possible uncertainties across different aspects of a response. This limitation can lead to overconfident or inconsistent model outputs, potentially resulting in misinformation or unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like dropout or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty, but these can be computationally expensive and may not provide fine-grained uncertainty information. Inspired by spectral analysis techniques in signal processing, we propose a method to sample across a spectrum of uncertainties, providing a more comprehensive view of model confidence. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to respond to natural language prompts, potentially offering a more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification without requiring access to model internals or expensive computational resources.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Sampling (USS), a novel prompting technique that generates a series of responses across a spectrum of confidence levels. The method involves: 1) Defining an 'uncertainty spectrum' ranging from highly certain to highly uncertain. 2) Generating multiple prompts that instruct the model to respond as if it were at different points along this spectrum. 3) Analyzing the variations in responses across the spectrum to construct a detailed uncertainty profile. For example, prompts might include 'Respond as if you're 90% certain', 'Respond as if you're 50% certain', etc. The collected responses are then analyzed for consistency, contradiction, and detail level to build a comprehensive uncertainty profile.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 3) AmbigQA for ambiguous questions. These datasets cover a range of question types and difficulty levels, allowing us to test USS across various scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting (standard query-response), 2) Temperature sampling (using different temperature settings), and 3) Few-shot CoT with confidence scoring (asking the model to provide a confidence score after each answer).",
            "Step 3: USS Implementation": "Implement the USS method: a) Define an uncertainty spectrum with 5 levels: 90%, 70%, 50%, 30%, and 10% certainty. b) For each question in the datasets, generate 5 prompts corresponding to these certainty levels. c) Collect responses for each certainty level.",
            "Step 4: Response Collection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 to generate responses for both baseline methods and USS. Collect 3 samples per prompt to account for potential variance in responses.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Answer Consistency: measure how consistent the answers are across certainty levels. b) Confidence Calibration: compare the model's stated confidence with its actual performance. c) Information Gain: assess how much additional information is provided at different certainty levels. d) Ambiguity Detection: evaluate the model's ability to identify and express ambiguity in questions.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform a comparative analysis of USS against the baseline methods. Specifically: a) Compare the accuracy of answers across methods. b) Analyze how well each method calibrates confidence with actual performance. c) Evaluate the ability of USS to detect and express ambiguity in questions. d) Assess the information gain provided by USS compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USS; 90% Certainty)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Respond as if you're 90% certain about your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USS; 90% Certainty)": "I'm 90% certain that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. He stepped onto the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USS; 50% Certainty)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Respond as if you're 50% certain about your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USS; 50% Certainty)": "I'm about 50% certain that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. It was during one of the Apollo missions in the late 1960s, but I'm not completely sure about the exact date or mission number.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USS; 10% Certainty)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Respond as if you're 10% certain about your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USS; 10% Certainty)": "I'm only 10% certain, but I think it might have been an American astronaut, possibly named Armstrong or Aldrin. It happened sometime in the 1960s or 1970s, I believe, but I'm really not sure about any of these details.",
            "explanation": "USS provides a spectrum of responses with varying levels of detail and expressed uncertainty, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence. This contrasts with the single, seemingly confident response from direct prompting, which doesn't capture the model's potential uncertainties or the nuances of its knowledge."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If USS doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of how LLMs express uncertainty across different prompting strategies. We could investigate: 1) How the language used to express uncertainty changes across the spectrum. 2) Whether certain types of questions or topics lead to more consistent or inconsistent responses across the spectrum. 3) How well the model's expressed uncertainty correlates with factual accuracy. 4) Whether there are patterns in the types of information added or omitted as certainty decreases. This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and inform future approaches to uncertainty quantification and confidence calibration."
