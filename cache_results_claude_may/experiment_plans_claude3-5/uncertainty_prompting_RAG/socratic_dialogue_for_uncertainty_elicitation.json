        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simplistic prompts that fail to uncover deeper uncertainties or knowledge gaps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches use direct questioning or single-turn interactions to elicit confidence estimates.",
        "Motivation": "The Socratic method of dialogue can reveal underlying assumptions and uncertainties through a series of probing questions, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Socratic Dialogue for Uncertainty Elicitation (SDUE), a multi-turn prompting strategy that engages the LLM in a Socratic-style dialogue to uncover its uncertainties. The method involves: 1) Initial response generation, 2) A series of follow-up questions challenging the model's assumptions and reasoning (e.g., 'How do you know that?', 'What if X were different?'), 3) Tracking changes in the model's stance and confidence throughout the dialogue, 4) Identifying points of contradiction or hesitation, and 5) Synthesizing a final calibrated confidence estimate based on the dialogue's progression. This approach allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SDUE with single-turn confidence elicitation on complex reasoning tasks. Evaluate the method's ability to uncover hidden uncertainties and improve calibration. Analyze the relationship between dialogue length, uncovered uncertainties, and final calibration accuracy."

        "Title": "Socratic Dialogue for Uncertainty Elicitation: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic prompts that fail to uncover deeper uncertainties or knowledge gaps. This leads to overconfident or poorly calibrated model outputs, potentially resulting in unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use direct questioning or single-turn interactions to elicit confidence estimates from LLMs. However, these methods may not capture the full extent of a model's uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks. The Socratic method of dialogue, which involves a series of probing questions to reveal underlying assumptions and uncertainties, has proven effective in human learning and critical thinking. We propose to adapt this method for LLMs to achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Socratic Dialogue for Uncertainty Elicitation (SDUE), a multi-turn prompting strategy that engages the LLM in a Socratic-style dialogue to uncover its uncertainties. The method involves five key steps: 1) Initial response generation, 2) A series of follow-up questions challenging the model's assumptions and reasoning, 3) Tracking changes in the model's stance and confidence throughout the dialogue, 4) Identifying points of contradiction or hesitation, and 5) Synthesizing a final calibrated confidence estimate based on the dialogue's progression. This approach allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's uncertainty landscape, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset, which contains questions designed to assess the truthfulness and uncertainty of language models. We will also use a subset of the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) dataset, focusing on tasks that require complex reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each question. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during generation and interpret the output probabilities as confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: SDUE Implementation": "Implement the SDUE method with the following sub-steps: a) Generate initial response, b) Generate 3-5 follow-up questions, c) Get model responses to follow-up questions, d) Analyze changes in stance and confidence, e) Synthesize final confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Run both baseline methods, b) Run the SDUE method, c) Record all intermediate outputs and final confidence estimates.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: 1) Calibration error (difference between confidence and accuracy), 2) Brier score, 3) ECE (Expected Calibration Error), 4) Qualitative analysis of dialogue progression.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare SDUE results with baselines. Analyze how dialogue length affects calibration. Investigate patterns in model behavior during Socratic questioning."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. I am 100% confident in this answer."
            },
            "SDUE Example": {
                "Initial Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Initial Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
                "Follow-up Questions": [
                    "Q1: How do you know Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                    "Q2: Are you aware of any controversies or alternative claims about the first moon landing?",
                    "Q3: What specific date and mission was associated with this event?",
                    "Q4: How certain are historians about this fact?",
                    "Q5: Could there be any scenarios where this information might be incorrect?"
                ],
                "Dialogue Progression": "Model responds to each question, potentially revealing uncertainties or gaps in knowledge.",
                "Final Confidence Estimation": "Based on the dialogue, I would estimate my confidence in Neil Armstrong being the first person to walk on the moon at 95%. While I'm highly confident in this fact due to extensive historical documentation and widespread acceptance, I acknowledge that there's always a small possibility of undiscovered information or alternative interpretations of historical events."
            },
            "Explanation": "The SDUE method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's knowledge and uncertainties. By engaging in a dialogue, the model is forced to consider potential weaknesses in its initial assertion, leading to a more calibrated final confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the SDUE method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper investigating why Socratic questioning fails to elicit better uncertainty estimates from LLMs. We would conduct a detailed error analysis, categorizing the types of questions that lead to useful uncertainty information versus those that don't. We could also explore how different LLMs respond to Socratic questioning, potentially uncovering interesting differences in their underlying knowledge representations or reasoning processes. Additionally, we might investigate whether certain topics or types of knowledge are more amenable to this approach than others, which could provide insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs' knowledge bases."
