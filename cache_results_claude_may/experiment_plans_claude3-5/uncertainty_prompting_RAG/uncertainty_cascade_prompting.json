        "Title": "Uncertainty Cascade Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models through Multi-Step Reasoning",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This issue is particularly pronounced in scenarios requiring intricate problem-solving or when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete information. Accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for building reliable AI systems, as it allows for better decision-making and helps identify when human intervention might be necessary.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting have shown promise in improving language model performance on complex tasks, but they do not explicitly address uncertainty quantification. Our method is inspired by the human cognitive process of breaking down complex problems and assessing uncertainty at each step. By decomposing the reasoning process and propagating uncertainty estimates, we aim to achieve more accurate and calibrated uncertainty quantification in large language models. This approach could lead to more reliable AI systems that can better recognize their own limitations and provide more trustworthy outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "Uncertainty Cascade Prompting involves a multi-step process: 1) Task Decomposition: The model breaks down the main task into subtasks. 2) Subtask Uncertainty Estimation: For each subtask, the model generates multiple solutions and estimates its uncertainty based on the diversity and consistency of these solutions. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: The uncertainty estimates from subtasks are propagated and combined to form an overall uncertainty estimate for the main task. 4) Adaptive Refinement: Based on the propagated uncertainty, the model decides whether to refine certain subtasks or gather more information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that involve complex reasoning tasks: MATH (mathematics), GSM8K (grade school math), and HotpotQA (multi-hop question answering). Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets if not already done.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting, 2) Chain-of-thought prompting, 3) Few-shot prompting. For each baseline, use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to generate answers and uncertainty estimates (e.g., by asking the model to provide a confidence score from 0 to 100).",
            "Step 3: Uncertainty Cascade Prompting Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following steps: a) Task Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the main task into subtasks. b) Subtask Uncertainty Estimation: For each subtask, generate multiple solutions (e.g., 3-5) and estimate uncertainty based on their diversity. c) Uncertainty Propagation: Combine subtask uncertainties to estimate overall task uncertainty. d) Adaptive Refinement: Implement a mechanism to decide whether to refine subtasks based on uncertainty thresholds.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the Uncertainty Cascade method. For example: Task Decomposition: \"Break down this problem into smaller, manageable subtasks:\"; Subtask Uncertainty Estimation: \"Generate 3 different approaches to solve this subtask and estimate your confidence in each approach:\"; Uncertainty Propagation: \"Based on the uncertainties of the subtasks, estimate the overall uncertainty for the main task:\"; Adaptive Refinement: \"If the uncertainty for any subtask is above 30%, suggest ways to refine or gather more information for that subtask:\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection and API Setup": "Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments. Set up API access and implement rate limiting and error handling.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on the test sets of MATH, GSM8K, and HotpotQA using both baseline methods and Uncertainty Cascade Prompting. For each problem, record the model's answer, uncertainty estimate, and intermediate steps (for Uncertainty Cascade Prompting).",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the results using the following metrics: 1) Task-specific performance measures (e.g., accuracy for MATH and GSM8K, F1 score for HotpotQA). 2) Calibration error: Compare predicted uncertainties with actual error rates. 3) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 4) Uncertainty resolution: Assess how well the method distinguishes between correct and incorrect answers.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: 1) Compare Uncertainty Cascade Prompting with baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze how uncertainty estimates change across subtasks and after refinement. 3) Identify types of problems where the method performs particularly well or poorly. 4) Examine the quality and relevance of subtask decompositions.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component: 1) Remove uncertainty propagation step. 2) Remove adaptive refinement step. 3) Vary the number of solutions generated for each subtask.",
            "Step 10: Report Writing": "Compile all results, analyses, and insights into a comprehensive report. Include visualizations of uncertainty estimates, performance comparisons, and example outputs from different methods."

            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "A: The area of the rectangle is 60 square centimeters. To calculate this, I multiplied the length (10 cm) by the width (6 cm): 10 cm \u00d7 6 cm = 60 sq cm. My confidence in this answer is 100 out of 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Q: If a rectangle has a length of 10 cm and a width of 6 cm, what is its area in square centimeters? Break down this problem into smaller, manageable subtasks:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "1. Identify the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.\n2. Extract the length and width values from the given information.\n3. Apply the formula using the extracted values.\n4. Provide the final answer with the correct unit.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 2: Subtask Uncertainty Estimation)": "For each subtask, generate 3 different approaches to solve it and estimate your confidence in each approach:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 2: Subtask Uncertainty Estimation)": "Subtask 1: Identify the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.\nApproach 1: Area = length \u00d7 width (Confidence: 100%)\nApproach 2: Area = 2(length + width) (Confidence: 20%)\nApproach 3: Area = \u03c0 \u00d7 length \u00d7 width (Confidence: 0%)\n\nSubtask 2: Extract the length and width values from the given information.\nApproach 1: Length = 10 cm, Width = 6 cm (Confidence: 100%)\nApproach 2: Length = 6 cm, Width = 10 cm (Confidence: 50%)\nApproach 3: Unable to extract values (Confidence: 0%)\n\nSubtask 3: Apply the formula using the extracted values.\nApproach 1: 10 cm \u00d7 6 cm = 60 sq cm (Confidence: 100%)\nApproach 2: 6 cm \u00d7 10 cm = 60 sq cm (Confidence: 100%)\nApproach 3: (10 cm + 6 cm) \u00d7 2 = 32 cm (Confidence: 20%)\n\nSubtask 4: Provide the final answer with the correct unit.\nApproach 1: 60 square centimeters (Confidence: 100%)\nApproach 2: 60 cm\u00b2 (Confidence: 100%)\nApproach 3: 60 (Confidence: 50%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Based on the uncertainties of the subtasks, estimate the overall uncertainty for the main task:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Overall uncertainty estimation:\nSubtask 1: 100% confident in the correct formula\nSubtask 2: 100% confident in correctly extracting values\nSubtask 3: 100% confident in applying the formula correctly\nSubtask 4: 100% confident in providing the correct final answer and unit\n\nCombining these uncertainties, the overall confidence in the final answer is 100%.

            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 4: Adaptive Refinement)": "If the uncertainty for any subtask is above 30%, suggest ways to refine or gather more information for that subtask:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 4: Adaptive Refinement)": "In this case, no subtasks have an uncertainty above 30%, so no refinement is necessary. The problem was straightforward, and all subtasks were solved with high confidence. If we needed to increase confidence further, we could:\n1. Double-check the formula for rectangle area in a geometry textbook.\n2. Verify the given dimensions by re-reading the problem statement.\n3. Use a calculator to ensure the multiplication is correct.\n4. Confirm the correct unit for area measurement in the metric system.",
            "explanation": "The Uncertainty Cascade Prompting method provides a more detailed and structured approach to solving the problem and estimating uncertainty. It breaks down the task into subtasks, generates multiple approaches for each, and explicitly estimates confidence at each step. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of where uncertainty might arise in the problem-solving process. In contrast, the standard prompting method provides a single answer with a high confidence score, without showing the reasoning process or potential sources of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the Uncertainty Cascade Prompting method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why the method fails. This might involve categorizing the types of problems where the method underperforms and analyzing the quality of subtask decompositions and uncertainty estimates. We could then use these insights to refine the prompting strategy or develop a hybrid approach that combines elements of Uncertainty Cascade Prompting with other methods. Additionally, we could explore the impact of different uncertainty propagation methods, such as using more sophisticated probabilistic models to combine subtask uncertainties. Another direction could be to investigate how the method performs with different types of language models or with fine-tuned models specifically trained on uncertainty estimation tasks. Finally, we could shift focus to analyze how the decomposition of tasks into subtasks affects the model's reasoning process and performance, even if it doesn't directly improve uncertainty estimation. This could lead to insights about how language models approach complex reasoning tasks and inform future research on improving their problem-solving capabilities."
