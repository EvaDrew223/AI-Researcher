        "Problem": "LLMs often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when faced with semantically similar queries, indicating a lack of robust meta-cognitive awareness.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically treat each query independently, missing the opportunity to leverage semantic similarities for more consistent uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of echo chambers in social psychology and resonance in physics, we propose a method to create 'cognitive resonance' between semantically similar queries to produce more consistent and robust uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Cognitive Resonance Chambers (MCRC), a prompting technique that creates a 'chamber' of semantically related queries to refine uncertainty estimates. The prompt guides the LLM to: 1) Generate a set of semantically similar queries to the original question. 2) Provide initial confidence estimates for each query in the set. 3) Identify inconsistencies in confidence across similar queries. 4) Engage in a meta-cognitive dialogue to resolve these inconsistencies, adjusting confidence estimates as necessary. 5) Synthesize a final, refined confidence estimate for the original query based on this 'resonance' process. This approach encourages the model to develop a more consistent and robust meta-cognitive framework for uncertainty estimation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MCRC on a diverse set of question-answering tasks, with a focus on semantically related query sets. Performance will be compared against standard confidence estimation techniques, with particular attention to consistency of uncertainty estimates across similar queries."

        "Title": "Meta-Cognitive Resonance Chambers: Enhancing Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when faced with semantically similar queries, indicating a lack of robust meta-cognitive awareness. This inconsistency can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications and hinder the model's ability to accurately assess its own knowledge limitations.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically treat each query independently, missing the opportunity to leverage semantic similarities for more consistent uncertainty estimation. Inspired by the concept of echo chambers in social psychology and resonance in physics, we propose a method to create 'cognitive resonance' between semantically similar queries to produce more consistent and robust uncertainty estimates. This approach encourages the model to develop a more consistent and robust meta-cognitive framework for uncertainty estimation, potentially leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Cognitive Resonance Chambers (MCRC), a prompting technique that creates a 'chamber' of semantically related queries to refine uncertainty estimates. The process involves five key steps: 1) Generate a set of semantically similar queries to the original question. 2) Provide initial confidence estimates for each query in the set. 3) Identify inconsistencies in confidence across similar queries. 4) Engage in a meta-cognitive dialogue to resolve these inconsistencies, adjusting confidence estimates as necessary. 5) Synthesize a final, refined confidence estimate for the original query based on this 'resonance' process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of question-answering tasks, focusing on datasets that contain semantically related query sets. Suitable datasets include: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing model honesty, 2) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension with unanswerable questions, and 3) AmbigQA for handling ambiguous queries. We will create subsets of these datasets containing clusters of semantically similar questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques: 1) Direct prompting: Ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 2) Calibrated probabilities: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the model's output probabilities. 3) Ensemble methods: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: MCRC Implementation": "Implement the MCRC method with the following prompts for each step: 1) Query Generation: 'Generate 5 questions that are semantically similar to: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION]' 2) Initial Confidence Estimation: 'For each of the following questions, provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100): [GENERATED_QUESTIONS]' 3) Inconsistency Identification: 'Analyze the confidence scores for the following related questions and identify any inconsistencies: [QUESTIONS_AND_SCORES]' 4) Meta-cognitive Dialogue: 'Engage in a self-dialogue to resolve the inconsistencies in confidence scores identified earlier. Adjust the scores as necessary.' 5) Final Synthesis: 'Based on the adjusted confidence scores for related questions, provide a final refined confidence score for the original question: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are suitable for complex prompting techniques and have shown strong performance in meta-cognitive tasks.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance: 1) Confidence Calibration Error (CCE): Measures the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. 2) Consistency Score: Calculated as the standard deviation of confidence scores across semantically similar queries (lower is better). 3) Answer Accuracy: Percentage of correctly answered questions. 4) Spearman's Rank Correlation: Between confidence scores and answer correctness.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset: 1) Apply baseline methods and record results. 2) Apply MCRC method and record results. 3) Compare MCRC performance against baselines using the defined metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare consistency of uncertainty estimates across similar queries between MCRC and baselines. 2) Analyze how MCRC affects overall accuracy and calibration. 3) Investigate cases where MCRC significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines. 4) Examine the meta-cognitive dialogues generated during the MCRC process to gain insights into the model's reasoning about its own uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to step on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Query Generation)": "Generate 5 questions that are semantically similar to: Who was the first person to step on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Query Generation)": "1. Who was the pioneer astronaut to walk on the lunar surface?\n2. Which Apollo mission member made the first footprint on the moon?\n3. What was the name of the first human to leave a footprint on the moon?\n4. Who uttered the famous words 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind' on the moon?\n5. Which NASA astronaut was the first to set foot on the moon during the Apollo program?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Initial Confidence Estimation)": "For each of the following questions, provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100): [GENERATED_QUESTIONS]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Initial Confidence Estimation)": "1. A: Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 98\n2. A: Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95\n3. A: Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 97\n4. A: Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 99\n5. A: Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 96",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Inconsistency Identification)": "Analyze the confidence scores for the following related questions and identify any inconsistencies: [QUESTIONS_AND_SCORES]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Inconsistency Identification)": "The confidence scores for these related questions are generally consistent, ranging from 95 to 99. There are no significant inconsistencies, but there is a slight variation in confidence levels. The highest confidence (99) is associated with the question about the famous quote, while the lowest (95) is for the question about the Apollo mission member.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Meta-cognitive Dialogue)": "Engage in a self-dialogue to resolve the inconsistencies in confidence scores identified earlier. Adjust the scores as necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Meta-cognitive Dialogue)": "Self: The confidence scores are quite consistent, but let's examine why there are slight variations.\nSelf: The highest confidence (99) is for the question about the famous quote. This makes sense as it's a well-known fact often associated with the moon landing.\nSelf: The lowest confidence (95) is for the Apollo mission member question. This might be slightly lower because it doesn't explicitly mention being the 'first' or 'stepping on the moon'.\nSelf: The other scores fall between 96-98, which seems appropriate given the slight variations in question phrasing.\nSelf: After consideration, I believe these scores accurately reflect the slight differences in question specificity and common knowledge. No adjustments seem necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Final Synthesis)": "Based on the adjusted confidence scores for related questions, provide a final refined confidence score for the original question: Who was the first person to step on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Final Synthesis)": "Final refined confidence score: 97\n\nReasoning: After analyzing the confidence scores for semantically similar questions and engaging in a meta-cognitive dialogue, I've determined that a confidence score of 97 is appropriate for the original question. This score reflects the high consistency across related questions and accounts for the slight variations due to question phrasing. The fact that Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon is well-established historical knowledge, justifying a high confidence score. However, maintaining a small margin for uncertainty (3 points) acknowledges the possibility of minor details or context that might not be captured in this simple statement.",
            "explanation": "The MCRC method demonstrates a more nuanced and consistent approach to confidence estimation. By generating semantically similar questions and analyzing the confidence scores across them, the model can refine its uncertainty estimate for the original question. This process allows for a more robust meta-cognitive assessment, potentially reducing inconsistencies in confidence estimation across similar queries."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the MCRC method doesn't significantly improve consistency or calibration of uncertainty estimates, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated semantically similar questions to understand if they're truly capturing the essence of the original question. This could lead to insights on improving query generation for better meta-cognitive assessment. 2) Examine the meta-cognitive dialogues to identify patterns in how the model reasons about its own uncertainty. This could inform the development of more effective prompting strategies or reveal limitations in the model's meta-cognitive capabilities. 3) Investigate how the performance of MCRC varies across different types of questions or domains. This could lead to a more nuanced understanding of when and why certain uncertainty estimation methods work better. 4) Explore combining MCRC with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibrated probabilities, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. 5) If consistency improves but calibration doesn't, we could focus on developing a post-processing step that adjusts the final confidence scores based on historical performance data."
