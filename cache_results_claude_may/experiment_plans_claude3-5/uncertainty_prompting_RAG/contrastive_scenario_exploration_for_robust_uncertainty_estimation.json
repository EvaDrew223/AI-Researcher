        "Problem": "LLMs often provide uncertainty estimates without considering alternative scenarios or edge cases, leading to potentially overconfident or underspecified uncertainty bounds.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically generate uncertainty estimates based on a single scenario or interpretation of the query, missing potential sources of uncertainty from contrasting situations.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring contrasting scenarios, we can identify boundary conditions and edge cases that may significantly impact uncertainty estimates, leading to more robust and comprehensive uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Robust Uncertainty Estimation (CSERE), a prompting technique that guides LLMs to generate and analyze contrasting scenarios. The process includes: 1) Initial Assessment: Prompt the LLM for an initial response and uncertainty estimate. 2) Contrastive Generation: Guide the LLM to generate a set of contrasting scenarios that could challenge or modify the initial assessment. 3) Scenario Analysis: For each contrasting scenario, prompt the LLM to reassess its response and uncertainty. 4) Boundary Condition Identification: Guide the LLM to identify key factors or thresholds that cause significant shifts in uncertainty across scenarios. 5) Robust Estimation: Synthesize insights from all scenarios into a final, more robust uncertainty estimate that accounts for identified boundary conditions and edge cases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CSERE on a range of tasks including factual question answering, predictive modeling, and decision-making scenarios. Compare against standard uncertainty estimation methods in terms of robustness to edge cases, calibration across diverse scenarios, and ability to identify critical factors influencing uncertainty."

        "Title": "Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Robust Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide uncertainty estimates without considering alternative scenarios or edge cases, leading to potentially overconfident or underspecified uncertainty bounds. This can result in unreliable decision-making in critical applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically generate uncertainty estimates based on a single scenario or interpretation of the query, missing potential sources of uncertainty from contrasting situations. By systematically exploring contrasting scenarios, we can identify boundary conditions and edge cases that may significantly impact uncertainty estimates, leading to more robust and comprehensive uncertainty quantification. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often consider multiple perspectives and potential outcomes before assessing our confidence in a decision.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Robust Uncertainty Estimation (CSERE), a prompting technique that guides LLMs to generate and analyze contrasting scenarios. The process includes five main steps: 1) Initial Assessment: Prompt the LLM for an initial response and uncertainty estimate. 2) Contrastive Generation: Guide the LLM to generate a set of contrasting scenarios that could challenge or modify the initial assessment. 3) Scenario Analysis: For each contrasting scenario, prompt the LLM to reassess its response and uncertainty. 4) Boundary Condition Identification: Guide the LLM to identify key factors or thresholds that cause significant shifts in uncertainty across scenarios. 5) Robust Estimation: Synthesize insights from all scenarios into a final, more robust uncertainty estimate that accounts for identified boundary conditions and edge cases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate CSERE: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) TimeQA for time-dependent predictions, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of tasks where uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with uncertainty estimation, and 2) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation. For direct prompting, we'll use the prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): [QUESTION]'. For Monte Carlo Dropout, we'll use the GPT-J-6B model with Hugging Face's transformers library, applying dropout during inference.",
            "Step 3: CSERE Implementation": "Implement the CSERE method using the following steps:\na) Initial Assessment: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): [QUESTION]'\nb) Contrastive Generation: 'Generate 3 contrasting scenarios that could challenge your initial answer or confidence level.'\nc) Scenario Analysis: For each scenario: 'Given this scenario, reassess your answer and confidence level.'\nd) Boundary Condition Identification: 'Identify key factors or thresholds that caused significant changes in your confidence across the scenarios.'\ne) Robust Estimation: 'Considering all scenarios and identified factors, provide a final answer and robust confidence level (0-100%).'\n",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. For the Monte Carlo Dropout baseline, we'll use the open-source GPT-J-6B model.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of CSERE compared to baselines:\na) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy.\nb) Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\nc) Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic Curve (AUCE): Evaluate the trade-off between confidence and error rate.\nd) Qualitative Analysis: Manually review a subset of examples to assess the quality and relevance of generated contrasting scenarios and identified boundary conditions.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\na) Run the baseline methods and collect results.\nb) Run the CSERE method and collect results.\nc) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and CSERE.\nd) Perform qualitative analysis on a subset of examples.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare the performance of CSERE against the baselines across all datasets and models. Analyze the impact of contrasting scenarios on uncertainty estimates and the effectiveness of boundary condition identification."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSERE; Step 1: Initial Assessment)": "Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSERE; Step 1: Initial Assessment)": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSERE; Step 2: Contrastive Generation)": "Generate 3 contrasting scenarios that could challenge your initial answer or confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSERE; Step 2: Contrastive Generation)": "1. Historical scenario: Consider a time period before Paris became the capital of France.\n2. Future scenario: Imagine a hypothetical situation where the French government decides to move the capital to another city.\n3. Alternative interpretation: Consider if the question is asking about the economic or cultural capital rather than the political capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSERE; Step 3: Scenario Analysis)": "Given this scenario, reassess your answer and confidence level: Historical scenario: Consider a time period before Paris became the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSERE; Step 3: Scenario Analysis)": "In a historical context before Paris became the capital, the answer would be different. For example, during the Middle Ages, the capital of the Kingdom of France varied and included cities like Laon, Reims, and Orl\u00e9ans. Given this historical perspective, my confidence in stating Paris as the capital decreases. Revised answer: The capital of France depends on the specific time period in history. Confidence level: 60%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSERE; Step 4: Boundary Condition Identification)": "Identify key factors or thresholds that caused significant changes in your confidence across the scenarios.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSERE; Step 4: Boundary Condition Identification)": "Key factors affecting confidence:\n1. Time period: The capital of France has changed throughout history, with Paris becoming the stable capital around the 12th century.\n2. Definition of 'capital': Whether it refers to the political, economic, or cultural center can affect the answer.\n3. Potential future changes: While unlikely, the possibility of the government moving the capital introduces a small degree of uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSERE; Step 5: Robust Estimation)": "Considering all scenarios and identified factors, provide a final answer and robust confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSERE; Step 5: Robust Estimation)": "Final answer: The current political capital of France is Paris. However, it's important to note that this answer depends on the specific time period in history and the definition of 'capital' being used. Robust confidence level: 92%",
            "Explanation": "CSERE prompts the model to consider alternative scenarios and boundary conditions, leading to a more nuanced and robust uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline method. The final confidence level (92%) is slightly lower than the initial estimate (95%) due to the consideration of historical changes and potential alternative interpretations of the question."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSERE does not significantly improve uncertainty estimation compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the quality and diversity of generated contrasting scenarios, assessing the model's ability to identify relevant boundary conditions, and investigating how well the model integrates insights from multiple scenarios. We could also explore variations of the CSERE method, such as adjusting the number of contrasting scenarios generated or modifying the prompts for each step. Additionally, we might investigate combining CSERE with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration approaches, to create a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches. If these attempts do not yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper that provides insights into the challenges of prompting-based uncertainty estimation and the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about their own uncertainty."
