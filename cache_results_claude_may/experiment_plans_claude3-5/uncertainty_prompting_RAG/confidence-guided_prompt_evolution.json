        "Problem": "Static prompts often lead to suboptimal performance and poorly calibrated confidence in LLMs, especially for complex or ambiguous tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "While some methods use fixed prompt chains or simple refinement strategies, they typically don't dynamically evolve prompts based on the model's expressed confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By allowing the prompt to evolve based on the model's confidence levels, we can adapt the query to address specific uncertainties and improve both performance and calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "Confidence-Guided Prompt Evolution involves an iterative process: 1) Initial prompt and response with confidence estimate. 2) Analysis of low-confidence aspects of the response. 3) Generation of targeted sub-prompts to address uncertainties. 4) Integration of new information from sub-prompts into an evolved main prompt. 5) Repeat steps 1-4 until high confidence is achieved or a maximum iteration limit is reached. The method includes specific instructions for the LLM to identify aspects of low confidence, generate relevant sub-queries, and synthesize new information into the evolving prompt.",

        "Title": "Confidence-Guided Prompt Evolution: Improving LLM Performance and Calibration through Dynamic Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Static prompts often lead to suboptimal performance and poorly calibrated confidence in Large Language Models (LLMs), especially for complex or ambiguous tasks. This issue is particularly pronounced in scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning or handling of uncertain information.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods, such as fixed prompt chains or simple refinement strategies, typically don't dynamically evolve prompts based on the model's expressed confidence. By allowing the prompt to evolve based on the model's confidence levels, we can adapt the query to address specific uncertainties and improve both performance and calibration. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to assess its own uncertainty and generate targeted follow-up queries, potentially leading to more robust and accurate responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "Confidence-Guided Prompt Evolution involves an iterative process: 1) Initial prompt and response with confidence estimate. 2) Analysis of low-confidence aspects of the response. 3) Generation of targeted sub-prompts to address uncertainties. 4) Integration of new information from sub-prompts into an evolved main prompt. 5) Repeat steps 1-4 until high confidence is achieved or a maximum iteration limit is reached. The method includes specific instructions for the LLM to identify aspects of low confidence, generate relevant sub-queries, and synthesize new information into the evolving prompt.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH (for mathematical reasoning) and BigBench (for diverse reasoning tasks). Select a subset of 1000 questions from each dataset, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Static prompting: Use a fixed prompt template for all questions. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Append 'Let's approach this step by step:' to each question. 3) Simple iterative refinement: Allow the model to refine its answer once without confidence guidance.",
            "Step 3: Confidence-Guided Prompt Evolution Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial prompt: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100) for your answer: [QUESTION]' b) Confidence analysis: 'Identify the aspects of your previous answer where you have low confidence. List these aspects.' c) Sub-prompt generation: 'Generate specific sub-questions to address the low-confidence aspects you identified.' d) Information integration: 'Based on the answers to the sub-questions, provide an updated answer to the original question with a new confidence score.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess performance across different model sizes.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: 1) Apply all baseline methods and record answers and execution time. 2) Apply the Confidence-Guided Prompt Evolution method, recording intermediate steps, final answer, confidence scores, and total execution time. 3) Set a maximum of 3 iterations for the evolution process.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Accuracy: Compare final answers against ground truth. 2) Confidence calibration: Analyze the correlation between confidence scores and actual accuracy. 3) Efficiency: Compare execution times across methods. 4) Evolution analysis: Track how prompts evolve and how this correlates with improved outcomes.",
            "Step 7: Result Analysis": "1) Compare accuracy across all methods. 2) Analyze confidence calibration using reliability diagrams. 3) Examine the trade-off between accuracy improvement and computational cost. 4) Perform qualitative analysis on a subset of examples to understand the prompt evolution process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "Question: In a right-angled triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm and one of the other sides is 6 cm. What is the length of the third side?",
                "Static Prompt Output": "The length of the third side is 8 cm.",
                "CoT Prompt Output": "Let's approach this step by step:\n1) In a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse.\n2) We know that c = 10 cm and one side (let's call it a) is 6 cm.\n3) Let's call the unknown side b.\n4) We can plug these into the Pythagorean theorem: 6\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 10\u00b2\n5) Simplify: 36 + b\u00b2 = 100\n6) Subtract 36 from both sides: b\u00b2 = 64\n7) Take the square root of both sides: b = 8\nTherefore, the length of the third side is 8 cm.",
                "Explanation": "While the CoT prompt provides a correct answer, it doesn't express any uncertainty or provide a confidence score, which could be misleading in more complex problems."
            },
            "Example 2 (Proposed Method Success)": {
                "Input": "Question: In a right-angled triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm and one of the other sides is 6 cm. What is the length of the third side?",
                "Initial Prompt Output": "The length of the third side is approximately 7.94 cm. Confidence score: 85",
                "Confidence Analysis": "Aspects of low confidence:\n1) The exact value of the third side (I provided an approximate value)\n2) The precision of the calculation",
                "Sub-prompt Generation": "1) What is the exact formula for calculating the third side of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse and one other side?\n2) How can we calculate the exact value without rounding?",
                "Information Integration": "Based on the answers to the sub-questions:\n1) The exact formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem: b = \u221a(c\u00b2 - a\u00b2), where c is the hypotenuse and a is the known side.\n2) We can calculate the exact value as follows:\nb = \u221a(10\u00b2 - 6\u00b2) = \u221a(100 - 36) = \u221a64 = 8 cm\nTherefore, the exact length of the third side is 8 cm. Confidence score: 100",
                "Explanation": "The Confidence-Guided Prompt Evolution method allowed the model to identify its uncertainties, seek specific information, and arrive at a more precise and confident answer."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Confidence-Guided Prompt Evolution method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the evolution patterns, focusing on why certain prompts lead to improved performance while others don't. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential limitations. 2) Investigate the relationship between expressed confidence and actual performance, which could lead to a paper on the calibration of LLMs across different tasks. 3) Explore alternative confidence estimation methods, such as ensemble approaches or calibrated softmax outputs, and compare their effectiveness in guiding prompt evolution. 4) Analyze the types of questions where the method performs well or poorly, which could inform task-specific prompt engineering strategies. 5) Investigate the impact of different iteration limits and stopping criteria on performance and efficiency, potentially leading to adaptive stopping strategies based on task complexity."
