        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when faced with scenarios that deviate from their training distribution or require nuanced understanding of causal relationships.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess confidence based on the given scenario alone, without exploring potential variations or counterfactuals.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often gauge their confidence by considering how their conclusions might change under slightly different circumstances. We aim to emulate this process in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a counterfactual scenario exploration technique for confidence calibration. Given a query, the model is first prompted to identify key factors or assumptions underlying its response. It is then instructed to generate a series of counterfactual scenarios by systematically varying these factors. For each counterfactual, the model provides a new response and a local confidence score. The global confidence is then calculated based on the stability of the response across counterfactuals, with more stable responses indicating higher confidence. Prompts will be carefully crafted to guide the model in generating meaningful counterfactuals and assessing their impact on the original conclusion.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on a range of causal reasoning tasks and scenario-based questions. Compare its performance to standard confidence estimation techniques, focusing on the method's ability to identify truly robust conclusions versus those that are sensitive to small changes in the scenario."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Scenario Exploration for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when faced with scenarios that deviate from their training distribution or require nuanced understanding of causal relationships. This can lead to overconfident responses in situations where the model's knowledge is limited or uncertain, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making based on the model's output.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically assess confidence based on the given scenario alone, without exploring potential variations or counterfactuals. Human experts, on the other hand, often gauge their confidence by considering how their conclusions might change under slightly different circumstances. By emulating this process in LLMs, we aim to improve their ability to accurately assess and communicate uncertainty, particularly in complex or novel scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a counterfactual scenario exploration technique for confidence calibration. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Given a query, prompt the model to identify key factors or assumptions underlying its response. 2) Instruct the model to generate a series of counterfactual scenarios by systematically varying these factors. 3) For each counterfactual, prompt the model to provide a new response and a local confidence score. 4) Calculate the global confidence based on the stability of the response across counterfactuals, with more stable responses indicating higher confidence. Prompts will be carefully crafted to guide the model in generating meaningful counterfactuals and assessing their impact on the original conclusion.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets that involve causal reasoning and scenario-based problems. We will use a combination of datasets: 1) COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) for causal reasoning, 2) SituatedQA for context-dependent questions, and 3) a subset of BIG-bench tasks related to counterfactual reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: 1) Softmax probabilities of the output distribution, 2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and 3) Ensemble methods using different model checkpoints or temperatures.",
            "Step 3: Counterfactual Prompting Implementation": "Develop a series of prompts for each step of our method: a) Factor identification prompt: 'What are the key factors or assumptions in this scenario that, if changed, could affect the outcome?', b) Counterfactual generation prompt: 'Generate 3-5 counterfactual scenarios by varying these key factors:', c) Local confidence assessment prompt: 'Given this counterfactual scenario, what is your response and how confident are you in this response on a scale of 1-10?'",
            "Step 4: Global Confidence Calculation": "Implement a function to calculate global confidence based on the stability of responses across counterfactuals. This could involve measuring the variance in responses or using a more sophisticated metric that considers both the consistency of the answers and the distribution of local confidence scores.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection and API Setup": "Set up API access for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 from OpenAI. Also, prepare local installations of open-source models like LLaMA-2 for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in our dataset: a) Run baseline confidence estimation methods, b) Execute our counterfactual exploration method, c) Record all responses, local confidence scores, and calculated global confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), 2) Brier score, 3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for identifying truly uncertain cases.",
            "Step 8: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare the performance of our method against baselines across different question types and models. Analyze cases where our method significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: a) Vary the number of counterfactuals generated, b) Test different prompts for factor identification and counterfactual generation, c) Explore alternative methods for aggregating local confidence scores into a global score."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: If a metal rod is heated, will it expand or contract?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A metal rod will expand when heated. This is due to thermal expansion, where the atoms in the metal vibrate more vigorously and take up more space as they gain thermal energy. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Factor Identification)": "Q: If a metal rod is heated, will it expand or contract? What are the key factors or assumptions in this scenario that, if changed, could affect the outcome?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Factor Identification)": "Key factors:\n1. Material of the rod (assuming it's a typical metal)\n2. Initial temperature of the rod\n3. Amount of heat applied\n4. Pressure conditions\n5. Presence of any external constraints",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Counterfactual Generation)": "Generate 3-5 counterfactual scenarios by varying these key factors:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Counterfactual Generation)": "1. What if the rod is made of a shape memory alloy instead of a typical metal?\n2. What if the rod is already at an extremely high temperature before additional heating?\n3. What if the rod is under high external pressure while being heated?\n4. What if the rod is fixed at both ends, preventing linear expansion?\n5. What if the 'rod' is actually a bimetallic strip composed of two metals with different thermal expansion coefficients?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Local Confidence Assessment)": "Given this counterfactual scenario: 'What if the rod is made of a shape memory alloy instead of a typical metal?', what is your response to the original question and how confident are you in this response on a scale of 1-10?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Local Confidence Assessment)": "Response: If the rod is made of a shape memory alloy, it may contract when heated, depending on its current phase and the specific temperature range. Shape memory alloys can exhibit unusual thermal expansion properties, including contraction upon heating in certain conditions.\nConfidence: 7/10",
            "Explanation": "The proposed method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the problem space, revealing potential exceptions and complexities that weren't considered in the initial confident response. This leads to a more calibrated final confidence assessment that better reflects the true uncertainty in the answer across various scenarios."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed counterfactual exploration method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of counterfactuals generated and their relevance to the original question. 2) Explore combining our method with existing calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 3) Investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the technique. 4) Analyze the relationship between the diversity of generated counterfactuals and calibration performance, which could provide insights into improving prompt engineering for this task. 5) Shift focus to using the counterfactual exploration as a method for enhancing explanations and transparency of model reasoning, rather than strictly for confidence calibration."
