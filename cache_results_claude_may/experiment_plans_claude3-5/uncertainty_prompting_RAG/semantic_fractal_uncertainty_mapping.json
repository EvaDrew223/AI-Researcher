        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture the hierarchical and self-similar nature of conceptual uncertainty across different levels of abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide flat or single-level uncertainty estimates without considering the fractal-like structure of semantic uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by fractal geometry, where patterns repeat at different scales, we can explore how uncertainty manifests across different levels of semantic abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Fractal Uncertainty Mapping (SFUM), which involves: 1) Generating an initial response and uncertainty estimate for a given query, 2) Prompting the model to decompose the query into sub-concepts and provide uncertainty estimates for each, 3) Recursively applying this process to create a fractal-like map of uncertainty across different levels of abstraction, 4) Analyzing the self-similarity and scale-invariance properties of the uncertainty patterns, and 5) Aggregating the multi-level uncertainty estimates to produce a more comprehensive uncertainty quantification that captures both local and global semantic uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SFUM on tasks requiring multi-level reasoning, such as hierarchical classification or nested question answering. Compare with flat uncertainty estimation methods in terms of calibration across different levels of abstraction, ability to identify conceptual blind spots, and richness of the uncertainty representation."

        "Title": "Semantic Fractal Uncertainty Mapping: Capturing Hierarchical Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture the hierarchical and self-similar nature of conceptual uncertainty across different levels of abstraction. This limitation leads to incomplete or misleading uncertainty estimates, particularly in complex reasoning tasks that involve multiple levels of conceptual understanding.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide flat or single-level uncertainty estimates without considering the fractal-like structure of semantic uncertainty. Inspired by fractal geometry, where patterns repeat at different scales, we can explore how uncertainty manifests across different levels of semantic abstraction. This approach could provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of model uncertainty, potentially improving model calibration and identifying conceptual blind spots.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Fractal Uncertainty Mapping (SFUM), which involves: 1) Generating an initial response and uncertainty estimate for a given query, 2) Prompting the model to decompose the query into sub-concepts and provide uncertainty estimates for each, 3) Recursively applying this process to create a fractal-like map of uncertainty across different levels of abstraction, 4) Analyzing the self-similarity and scale-invariance properties of the uncertainty patterns, and 5) Aggregating the multi-level uncertainty estimates to produce a more comprehensive uncertainty quantification that captures both local and global semantic uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require multi-level reasoning: 1) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, 2) MATH dataset for mathematical problem-solving, and 3) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning. These datasets cover a range of tasks that involve hierarchical conceptual understanding.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models have shown strong performance in complex reasoning tasks and provide uncertainty estimates through their logits.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct uncertainty estimation: Use the model's logits to estimate uncertainty for the final answer. 2) Flat decomposition: Break down the question into sub-components once, estimate uncertainty for each, and aggregate.",
            "Step 4: SFUM Implementation": "Implement the SFUM method as follows: a) Generate initial response and uncertainty estimate. b) Prompt the model to decompose the query into sub-concepts. c) For each sub-concept, recursively apply steps a and b up to a maximum depth of 3. d) Collect uncertainty estimates at each level.",
            "Step 5: Uncertainty Aggregation": "Develop an aggregation method that combines uncertainty estimates from different levels. We will experiment with two approaches: 1) Weighted sum of uncertainties across levels, with weights decreasing for deeper levels. 2) Max uncertainty across all levels and sub-concepts.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of SFUM against baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare predicted uncertainty with actual error rates. 2) Spearman rank correlation: Between uncertainty estimates and actual errors. 3) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC): For binary classification of correct/incorrect predictions based on uncertainty.",
            "Step 7: Analysis of Fractal Properties": "Analyze the self-similarity and scale-invariance of uncertainty patterns across levels. Calculate fractal dimension using box-counting method on the uncertainty maps.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of: 1) Recursion depth, 2) Aggregation method, 3) Prompt design for decomposition."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Uncertainty)": "Q: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a hotel in a city that is known as 'The Pink City'. Which city is this?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Uncertainty)": "A: The city known as 'The Pink City' that has an Oberoi hotel is Jaipur, India. Uncertainty: 0.2",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFUM; Level 1)": "Q: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a hotel in a city that is known as 'The Pink City'. Which city is this? Decompose this question into its main concepts and provide uncertainty estimates for each.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFUM; Level 1)": "Decomposition:\n1. Oberoi family and their hotel company (Uncertainty: 0.1)\n2. 'The Pink City' and its identity (Uncertainty: 0.3)\n3. Oberoi hotel locations (Uncertainty: 0.2)\nOverall answer: Jaipur, India (Uncertainty: 0.15)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFUM; Level 2)": "For the concept 'The Pink City' and its identity, please further decompose this into sub-concepts and provide uncertainty estimates for each.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFUM; Level 2)": "Sub-concepts of 'The Pink City':\n1. Origin of the nickname (Uncertainty: 0.2)\n2. Geographical location in India (Uncertainty: 0.1)\n3. Cultural significance (Uncertainty: 0.3)\n4. Other notable features of the city (Uncertainty: 0.4)",
            "Explanation": "SFUM provides a more detailed uncertainty map across different levels of abstraction, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence in various aspects of the question. This hierarchical approach captures uncertainties that might be missed in a flat uncertainty estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SFUM does not show significant improvements over baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why the method fails. We will examine the generated decompositions to ensure they are meaningful and relevant. If the decompositions are poor, we can explore alternative prompting strategies or fine-tuning approaches to improve the quality of concept decomposition. Additionally, we can investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from SFUM than others, potentially leading to insights about when hierarchical uncertainty estimation is most valuable. If the aggregation method is the bottleneck, we can explore more sophisticated aggregation techniques, such as using a small neural network trained on a held-out set to learn optimal aggregation weights. Finally, if the fractal properties are not evident, we can shift the focus to analyzing the patterns of uncertainty propagation across levels, which could still provide valuable insights into how language models reason about complex questions."
