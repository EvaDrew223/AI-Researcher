    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs typically focus solely on textual information, potentially missing out on valuable cues from other modalities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches rely on text-based prompting or statistical analysis of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Incorporating multiple modalities can provide richer context for uncertainty estimation, mimicking how humans assess confidence using diverse information sources.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel prompting strategy that leverages both text and image inputs: 1) Text-Based Confidence: Generate an initial answer and confidence estimate based on the text query. 2) Image Generation: Prompt the model to generate or retrieve relevant images that could support or refute the answer. 3) Image-Based Refinement: Analyze the generated/retrieved images to refine the confidence estimate. 4) Multi-Modal Integration: Combine text-based and image-based confidence estimates for a final uncertainty quantification. Prompts will include instructions like 'Generate images that could support or contradict your answer' and 'Analyze these images and explain how they impact your confidence in the original answer'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on multi-modal datasets, comparing against text-only baselines. Assess both calibration metrics and the relevance/quality of generated images."

        "Title": "Multi-Modal Prompting for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) typically focus solely on textual information, potentially missing out on valuable cues from other modalities that could improve confidence calibration and uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches rely primarily on text-based prompting or statistical analysis of model outputs. However, humans often assess their confidence using diverse information sources, including visual cues. Incorporating multiple modalities can provide richer context for uncertainty estimation, potentially leading to more accurate and well-calibrated confidence assessments in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel multi-modal prompting strategy that leverages both text and image inputs for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Text-Based Confidence: Generate an initial answer and confidence estimate based on the text query. 2) Image Generation: Prompt the model to generate or retrieve relevant images that could support or refute the answer. 3) Image-Based Refinement: Analyze the generated/retrieved images to refine the confidence estimate. 4) Multi-Modal Integration: Combine text-based and image-based confidence estimates for a final uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a multi-modal dataset combining text questions with relevant images. We'll use the VQA (Visual Question Answering) dataset and augment it with additional questions that require uncertainty estimation. For each question, we'll have a ground truth answer and a human-annotated confidence score.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We'll use GPT-4 with vision capabilities (or Claude 2 if GPT-4 with vision is not available) as our primary model for both text and image processing. We'll also use DALL-E 2 or Stable Diffusion for image generation tasks.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement text-only baselines: a) Direct prompting b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting c) Calibrated prompting (e.g., using temperature scaling)",
            "Step 4: Multi-Modal Prompting Implementation": "Implement our proposed method: a) Text-Based Confidence: Prompt the model with 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' b) Image Generation: Prompt with 'Generate an image that could help answer or verify the following question: [QUESTION]' c) Image-Based Refinement: Prompt with 'Analyze this image in relation to the question [QUESTION]. How does it impact your confidence in the answer?' d) Multi-Modal Integration: Prompt with 'Given your initial answer, confidence, and image analysis, provide a final answer and confidence score.'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate both baseline and proposed methods using: a) Accuracy of answers b) Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, Maximum Calibration Error) c) Brier score d) Image relevance and quality (using human evaluation or automated metrics)",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component: a) Text-only vs. Text + Generated Images vs. Text + Retrieved Images b) Different integration strategies for combining text and image confidences c) Varying the number of generated/retrieved images",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform qualitative analysis on cases where multi-modal prompting significantly improves or degrades performance compared to text-only baselines. Categorize these cases to understand when visual information is most beneficial for uncertainty quantification."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: How many people are wearing hats in this image? [IMAGE]",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "I can't see any image in this context, so I cannot answer the question about how many people are wearing hats. My confidence in this answer is 100% because I'm certain that no image has been provided to me.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Text-Based Confidence)": "Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: How many people are wearing hats in this image? [IMAGE]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Text-Based Confidence)": "Based on the image provided, I can see 3 people wearing hats. My confidence score for this answer is 90 out of 100. While I'm quite certain about the count, there's a small possibility that I might have missed a hat or misinterpreted something in the image.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Image Generation)": "Generate an image that could help answer or verify the following question: How many people are wearing hats in this image?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Image Generation)": "[A generated image showing a group of people, some wearing hats and some not, in a clear and easily countable arrangement]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Image-Based Refinement)": "Analyze this image in relation to the question 'How many people are wearing hats in this image?'. How does it impact your confidence in the answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Image-Based Refinement)": "The generated image shows a clear scene with 5 people, 3 of whom are wearing distinct hats. This image increases my confidence in the ability to accurately count people wearing hats in a given scene. However, it's important to note that this generated image may not perfectly match the original image in the question. My confidence in the accuracy of counting hats in this generated image is very high, about 95 out of 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Multi-Modal Integration)": "Given your initial answer of 3 people wearing hats with 90% confidence, and the analysis of the generated image showing 3 out of 5 people wearing hats with 95% confidence, provide a final answer and confidence score for the original question: How many people are wearing hats in this image?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Multi-Modal Integration)": "Final answer: 3 people are wearing hats in the image. Final confidence score: 92 out of 100. The generated image, while not identical to the original, supports the initial count and increases overall confidence slightly. The high consistency between the initial observation and the generated image reinforces the likelihood of the answer being correct.",
            "Explanation": "The multi-modal approach allows for a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence assessment. By generating and analyzing a relevant image, the model can cross-reference its initial text-based understanding, potentially catching errors or reinforcing correct observations. This process mimics how humans might seek additional visual information to verify their understanding, leading to a more robust uncertainty quantification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-modal prompting method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to text-only baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where multi-modal prompting fails, categorizing error types and identifying potential limitations of the approach. This could provide valuable insights into the challenges of integrating visual and textual information for uncertainty estimation. 2) Explore alternative methods for combining text and image confidences, such as weighted averaging, learned integration, or more complex fusion techniques. 3) Investigate the impact of image quality and relevance on uncertainty estimation, potentially leading to a study on how to generate or retrieve more informative images for this task. 4) Expand the study to include other modalities, such as audio or structured data, to create a more comprehensive multi-modal uncertainty quantification framework. 5) Focus on improving the image generation/retrieval step to produce more relevant and informative images, which could indirectly improve the overall uncertainty estimation process."
