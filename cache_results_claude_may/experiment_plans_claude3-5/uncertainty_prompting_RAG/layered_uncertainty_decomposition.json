    "idea_name": "Layered Uncertainty Decomposition",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often provide a single, aggregate measure of uncertainty, which fails to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like ensemble methods or dropout to estimate overall prediction uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often break down their uncertainty into different components when assessing complex problems. Inspired by this, we can prompt LLMs to decompose their uncertainty across multiple layers of abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Layered Uncertainty Decomposition (LUD), a novel prompting technique that guides LLMs to assess uncertainty at multiple levels: 1) Factual: uncertainty about specific facts or data, 2) Conceptual: uncertainty about the understanding or interpretation of concepts, 3) Logical: uncertainty about the reasoning process, and 4) Contextual: uncertainty about the relevance or applicability of the response to the given context. The prompt instructs the LLM to provide a structured output with uncertainty scores and explanations for each layer, allowing for a more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare LUD against baseline uncertainty estimation methods on diverse tasks including factual QA, logical reasoning, and open-ended generation. Evaluate using calibration metrics, human expert ratings, and task-specific performance improvements when leveraging the layered uncertainty information."

        "Title": "Layered Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single, aggregate measure of uncertainty, which fails to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty across different aspects of a response. This limitation hinders the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs, especially in critical applications where understanding the source and nature of uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like ensemble methods or dropout to estimate overall prediction uncertainty. However, these methods lack granularity and fail to distinguish between different types of uncertainty that may be present in an LLM's response. Human experts often break down their uncertainty into different components when assessing complex problems. Inspired by this, we propose a method to prompt LLMs to decompose their uncertainty across multiple layers of abstraction, providing a more nuanced and interpretable measure of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Layered Uncertainty Decomposition (LUD), a novel prompting technique that guides LLMs to assess uncertainty at multiple levels: 1) Factual: uncertainty about specific facts or data, 2) Conceptual: uncertainty about the understanding or interpretation of concepts, 3) Logical: uncertainty about the reasoning process, and 4) Contextual: uncertainty about the relevance or applicability of the response to the given context. The prompt instructs the LLM to provide a structured output with uncertainty scores and explanations for each layer, allowing for a more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use diverse datasets that cover different types of tasks: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, 3) BoolQ for yes/no questions, and 4) ARC-Challenge for science question answering. These datasets will help evaluate the effectiveness of LUD across various domains and task types.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct prompting with a single confidence score, b) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation, c) Ensemble of models (using different seeds or temperatures) for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: LUD Prompt Design": "Design the LUD prompt template. Example: \"Provide an answer to the following question, followed by an assessment of your uncertainty across four layers: Factual, Conceptual, Logical, and Contextual. For each layer, provide an uncertainty score from 0 (completely certain) to 10 (completely uncertain), and a brief explanation. Question: [INSERT QUESTION HERE]\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods to get predictions and uncertainty estimates. b) Apply the LUD prompt to get layered uncertainty decomposition. c) Store all outputs, including intermediate steps for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Accuracy of predictions, b) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), c) Spearman rank correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness, d) Human evaluation of uncertainty explanations (on a subset of examples).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis: a) Compare overall performance of LUD against baselines, b) Analyze the distribution of uncertainty across different layers for correct vs. incorrect predictions, c) Investigate how different types of questions lead to different uncertainty patterns, d) Evaluate the quality and consistency of uncertainty explanations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 10, where 0 is completely uncertain and 10 is completely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 10",
            "LUD Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide an answer, followed by an assessment of your uncertainty across four layers: Factual, Conceptual, Logical, and Contextual. For each layer, provide an uncertainty score from 0 (completely certain) to 10 (completely uncertain), and a brief explanation.",
            "LUD Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nUncertainty assessment:\n1. Factual Uncertainty: 0/10\nExplanation: This is a well-known fact that I'm completely certain about.\n\n2. Conceptual Uncertainty: 1/10\nExplanation: The concept of a capital city is clear, but there's a slight uncertainty about whether we're referring to the administrative or cultural capital.\n\n3. Logical Uncertainty: 0/10\nExplanation: No complex reasoning is required for this straightforward factual question.\n\n4. Contextual Uncertainty: 2/10\nExplanation: While the question is clear, there's a small possibility that the context might be referring to a different time period or an alternate reality.",
            "Explanation": "The LUD method provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty, breaking it down into different components. This allows us to see that while the model is very certain about the factual information, there are slight uncertainties in the conceptual and contextual aspects. This granular information is not available in the baseline method, which only provides an overall confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the LUD method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how uncertainty patterns vary across different question types and domains, potentially uncovering insights about LLM behavior. 2) Investigate whether certain layers of uncertainty are more predictive of correctness than others, which could lead to a weighted uncertainty score. 3) Explore how different prompting strategies affect the quality and consistency of uncertainty decomposition, potentially leading to improvements in the method. 4) Analyze cases where LUD performs worse than baselines to understand its limitations and propose potential improvements. 5) Investigate whether LUD can be used as a tool for detecting potential biases or inconsistencies in LLM responses by looking for patterns in uncertainty across different topics or question types."
