        "Problem": "Language models often express overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize subtle semantic nuances that could alter the correctness of their answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on direct confidence elicitation or consistency checks across multiple samples.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically perturbing input semantics, we can probe the model's sensitivity to subtle changes and reveal underlying uncertainties not captured by existing methods.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting process: 1) Semantic Perturbation Generation: Given an input query, we prompt the model to generate a set of semantically perturbed versions that subtly alter the meaning or implications of the original query. 2) Uncertainty Amplification: We then prompt the model with both the original and perturbed queries, asking it to analyze how its confidence and answers change across these variations. The model must reconcile these differences to produce a final confidence estimate that accounts for semantic sensitivities. This method encourages more nuanced uncertainty quantification by forcing the model to confront semantic edge cases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on fact-checking and open-ended QA tasks, comparing against standard confidence elicitation baselines. Measure improvements in calibration and the model's ability to identify semantically ambiguous queries."

        "Title": "Semantic Perturbation-based Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize subtle semantic nuances that could alter the correctness of their answers. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable or misleading information being presented as factual, which is particularly problematic in critical applications such as medical diagnosis or legal advice.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in language models primarily focus on direct confidence elicitation or consistency checks across multiple samples. However, these approaches may not capture the full spectrum of semantic uncertainties inherent in natural language. By systematically perturbing input semantics, we can probe the model's sensitivity to subtle changes and reveal underlying uncertainties not captured by existing methods. This approach is inspired by the human cognitive process of considering alternative phrasings or interpretations when assessing the certainty of a statement.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting process for uncertainty quantification:\n1. Semantic Perturbation Generation: Given an input query, we prompt the model to generate a set of semantically perturbed versions that subtly alter the meaning or implications of the original query.\n2. Uncertainty Amplification: We then prompt the model with both the original and perturbed queries, asking it to analyze how its confidence and answers change across these variations. The model must reconcile these differences to produce a final confidence estimate that accounts for semantic sensitivities.\nThis method encourages more nuanced uncertainty quantification by forcing the model to confront semantic edge cases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for evaluation: (1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking tasks, and (2) AmbigQA for open-ended question answering tasks with ambiguous queries.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. (2) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Generate multiple responses using different temperature settings and calculate the variance in answers.",
            "Step 3: Semantic Perturbation Generation": "For each query in the datasets, prompt the model to generate 3-5 semantic perturbations. Use the following prompt structure: 'Generate 3-5 variations of the following question that slightly alter its meaning or implications: [ORIGINAL_QUERY]'",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Amplification": "For each original query and its perturbations, prompt the model with the following structure: 'Consider the following related questions:\n1. [ORIGINAL_QUERY]\n2. [PERTURBED_QUERY_1]\n3. [PERTURBED_QUERY_2]\n...\nProvide an answer to the first question, and explain how your confidence and answer might change for the variations. Finally, give an overall confidence score (0-100) that accounts for these variations.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of our method against the baselines using the following metrics: (1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. (2) AUC-ROC: assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores. (3) Spearman correlation: calculate the correlation between confidence scores and human-annotated answer quality or ambiguity ratings.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a qualitative analysis of cases where our method significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. Examine the generated perturbations and the model's reasoning about confidence changes to gain insights into the method's strengths and limitations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. He took his historic first steps on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nConfidence: 100\n\nI am 100% confident in this answer. The moon landing of Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong being the first person to walk on the moon is a well-documented historical fact that is widely known and accepted.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Semantic Perturbation-based Method)": "Consider the following related questions:\n1. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the first American to set foot on the lunar surface?\n3. Who was the first NASA astronaut to step onto the moon?\n4. Who made the famous 'one small step for man' quote on the moon?\nProvide an answer to the first question, and explain how your confidence and answer might change for the variations. Finally, give an overall confidence score (0-100) that accounts for these variations.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Semantic Perturbation-based Method)": "Answer to the first question: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong.\n\nExplanation of variations:\n2. This variation doesn't change the answer or my confidence, as Neil Armstrong was indeed American.\n3. This also refers to Neil Armstrong, as he was a NASA astronaut.\n4. Neil Armstrong famously said this quote, so this variation also confirms the original answer.\n\nHowever, these variations make me consider potential nuances:\n- There could be conspiracy theories or disputed claims about the moon landing.\n- The phrasing 'set foot' vs 'walk' might lead to discussions about whether Armstrong or Aldrin touched the surface first.\n- The NASA specification makes me consider if there were any non-NASA lunar missions I might be unaware of.\n\nOverall confidence score: 98\n\nWhile I'm very confident in the answer, the variations have made me aware of potential minor uncertainties or alternative interpretations that slightly reduce my absolute certainty.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed method encourages the model to consider semantic nuances and potential ambiguities, leading to a more nuanced confidence assessment. In contrast, the baseline method tends to produce overconfident responses without considering potential uncertainties."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed semantic perturbation-based method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Analyze the generated perturbations to understand what types of semantic variations the model is sensitive or insensitive to. This could provide insights into the model's understanding of language and context. (2) Investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a targeted application of the technique. (3) Explore combining our method with existing uncertainty quantification techniques, such as using the semantic perturbations as input for ensemble methods or calibration techniques. (4) Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify patterns in cases where the method fails, which could inform the development of more sophisticated perturbation strategies or prompt engineering techniques."
