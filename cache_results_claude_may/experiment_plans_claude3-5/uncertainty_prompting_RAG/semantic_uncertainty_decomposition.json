    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often provide a single scalar confidence score, which fails to capture the nuanced and multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in natural language tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches use softmax probabilities or ensemble disagreement to estimate overall uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how humans break down complex problems, we believe decomposing uncertainty into semantic components can provide more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Decomposition (SUD), a prompting technique that guides LLMs to break down their uncertainty into interpretable semantic components. The process involves: 1) Prompt the LLM to identify key semantic aspects of the task (e.g., factual knowledge, logical reasoning, contextual understanding). 2) For each aspect, prompt the model to generate specific sub-questions that probe its confidence. 3) Have the LLM answer these sub-questions and provide a confidence score for each. 4) Prompt the LLM to synthesize these component uncertainties into an overall uncertainty estimate, explaining how each factor contributes. This method provides a structured, interpretable breakdown of the model's uncertainty across different dimensions of the task.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SUD against baseline scalar uncertainty estimates on diverse NLP tasks including question-answering, summarization, and reasoning. Measure not only overall calibration but also the correlation between component uncertainties and specific error types to validate the semantic decomposition."

        "Title": "Semantic Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single scalar confidence score, which fails to capture the nuanced and multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in natural language tasks. This limitation hinders our ability to understand and interpret model confidence across different aspects of a given task, potentially leading to misplaced trust in model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches, such as using softmax probabilities or ensemble disagreement, provide only an overall uncertainty estimate. However, uncertainty in natural language tasks is often multi-dimensional, stemming from various factors like factual knowledge, logical reasoning, and contextual understanding. Inspired by how humans break down complex problems, we believe decomposing uncertainty into semantic components can provide more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates. This approach could offer a more granular understanding of model confidence, potentially improving model interpretability and enabling more targeted improvements in model performance.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Decomposition (SUD), a prompting technique that guides LLMs to break down their uncertainty into interpretable semantic components. The process involves four main steps: 1) Prompt the LLM to identify key semantic aspects of the task (e.g., factual knowledge, logical reasoning, contextual understanding). 2) For each aspect, prompt the model to generate specific sub-questions that probe its confidence. 3) Have the LLM answer these sub-questions and provide a confidence score for each. 4) Prompt the LLM to synthesize these component uncertainties into an overall uncertainty estimate, explaining how each factor contributes. This method provides a structured, interpretable breakdown of the model's uncertainty across different dimensions of the task.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use three diverse NLP datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) LAMBADA for text completion requiring contextual understanding, and 3) LogiQA for logical reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty quantification methods: 1) Softmax probability: Use the model's softmax output as a confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: SUD Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Uncertainty Decomposition method using the following steps for each task: a) Identify semantic aspects: Prompt the model to list 3-5 key semantic aspects relevant to the task. b) Generate sub-questions: For each aspect, prompt the model to generate 2-3 specific sub-questions. c) Answer sub-questions: Have the model answer each sub-question and provide a confidence score (0-100). d) Synthesize uncertainty: Prompt the model to combine the component uncertainties into an overall score and explanation.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare SUD against baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration: Measure how well the uncertainty estimates align with actual error rates. 2) Correlation: Analyze the correlation between component uncertainties and specific error types. 3) Human evaluation: Have human raters assess the interpretability and usefulness of the uncertainty breakdowns.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of SUD performance across different task types. 2) Analysis of which semantic aspects contribute most to overall uncertainty in different scenarios. 3) Investigation of cases where SUD significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Identify Semantic Aspects)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Identify 3-5 key semantic aspects relevant to answering this question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Identify Semantic Aspects)": "1. Factual knowledge of world capitals\n2. Understanding of current geopolitical structures\n3. Awareness of potential historical changes in capital cities\n4. Comprehension of the concept of a 'capital city'",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Generate Sub-questions)": "For each semantic aspect, generate 2-3 specific sub-questions that probe the model's confidence in that aspect.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Generate Sub-questions)": "1. Factual knowledge of world capitals:\n   - Can you name the capital of France without hesitation?\n   - Are you aware of any other cities that might be mistaken for France's capital?\n2. Understanding of current geopolitical structures:\n   - Is France currently a sovereign nation with its own capital?\n   - Has there been any recent change in France's government structure that might affect its capital?\n3. Awareness of potential historical changes in capital cities:\n   - Has the capital of France changed in the last 200 years?\n   - Are you aware of any historical events that might have led to a change in France's capital?\n4. Comprehension of the concept of a 'capital city':\n   - Can you define what makes a city the 'capital' of a country?\n   - Are you confident in distinguishing between a country's capital and its largest or most famous city?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Answer Sub-questions)": "Answer each sub-question and provide a confidence score (0-100) for each answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Answer Sub-questions)": "1a. Yes, I can name the capital of France without hesitation. It's Paris. Confidence: 100\n1b. Yes, some might mistakenly think Lyon or Marseille is the capital. Confidence: 90\n2a. Yes, France is currently a sovereign nation with its own capital. Confidence: 100\n2b. No, there have been no recent changes affecting France's capital. Confidence: 95\n3a. No, the capital of France has not changed in the last 200 years. Confidence: 95\n3b. Yes, I'm aware that Paris became the official capital after the French Revolution. Confidence: 85\n4a. A capital city is typically the seat of government and administrative center of a country. Confidence: 100\n4b. Yes, I'm confident in distinguishing between a capital and other important cities. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Synthesize Uncertainty)": "Based on the answers and confidence scores for the sub-questions, provide an overall answer to the original question 'What is the capital of France?', along with an overall confidence score and an explanation of how each semantic aspect contributes to the uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Synthesize Uncertainty)": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nOverall Confidence Score: 98\nExplanation: The high confidence score is based on strong certainty across all semantic aspects. The factual knowledge of world capitals (aspect 1) shows perfect confidence in naming Paris as the capital. The understanding of current geopolitical structures (aspect 2) confirms France's status as a sovereign nation with no recent changes affecting its capital. Historical awareness (aspect 3) indicates stability in the capital's location, with only slight uncertainty about specific historical details. The comprehension of what constitutes a capital city (aspect 4) is strong, further supporting the confidence in the answer. The slight reduction from 100 to 98 in overall confidence accounts for the small uncertainties in historical details and the awareness of potential misconceptions about other French cities.",
            "Explanation": "The SUD method provides a more detailed and interpretable uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline. It breaks down the confidence across different semantic aspects, allowing for a nuanced understanding of where any uncertainty might stem from. This approach not only gives an overall confidence score but also explains the reasoning behind it, which can be more informative and actionable for users or downstream tasks."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SUD method does not significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration or correlation with error types, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated semantic aspects and sub-questions to understand if they are truly capturing the relevant dimensions of uncertainty for each task. This could lead to insights about how LLMs conceptualize uncertainty in different domains. Second, we could investigate whether the process of decomposing uncertainty, even if not more accurate, leads to improved interpretability or user trust in the model's outputs. This could involve expanded human evaluation studies. Third, we could explore using the semantic decomposition as a form of data augmentation or fine-tuning signal for improving model performance on the original tasks. Finally, if the method shows varying effectiveness across different task types, we could focus on developing task-specific uncertainty decomposition strategies, potentially uncovering unique characteristics of uncertainty in different NLP domains."
