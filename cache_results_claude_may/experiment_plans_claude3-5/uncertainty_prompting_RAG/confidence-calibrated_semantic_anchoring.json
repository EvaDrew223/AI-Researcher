    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across diverse domains and tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include using model logits, ensemble methods, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting.",
        "Motivation": "By grounding confidence estimation in semantic relationships between concepts, we can potentially achieve more robust and generalizable calibration across different domains and tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Semantic Anchoring (CCSA), a novel prompting technique that leverages semantic relationships to calibrate confidence. The method involves: 1) Generating a set of 'semantic anchors' - key concepts related to the query, 2) Prompting the model to estimate its confidence in understanding each anchor, 3) Constructing a 'semantic confidence map' by analyzing the relationships between these anchors, 4) Using this map to guide the model in calibrating its confidence for the original query. For example, for a medical diagnosis task, anchors might include relevant symptoms, potential conditions, and diagnostic procedures. The prompt would guide the model to assess its knowledge of each anchor, then use this to inform its overall confidence in the diagnosis.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CCSA against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and logit-based approaches across multiple domains (e.g., scientific QA, medical diagnosis, legal reasoning). Evaluate using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score, as well as performance on out-of-distribution tasks to assess generalization."

        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Semantic Anchoring: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across diverse domains and tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potentially harmful decisions when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence calibration, such as using model logits, ensemble methods, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting, have shown limited success in achieving robust and generalizable calibration across different domains and tasks. By grounding confidence estimation in semantic relationships between concepts, we can potentially achieve more robust and generalizable calibration. This approach leverages the model's understanding of conceptual relationships to inform its confidence estimates, potentially leading to more accurate and consistent calibration across diverse tasks and domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Semantic Anchoring (CCSA), a novel prompting technique that leverages semantic relationships to calibrate confidence. The method involves four main steps: 1) Generating a set of 'semantic anchors' - key concepts related to the query, 2) Prompting the model to estimate its confidence in understanding each anchor, 3) Constructing a 'semantic confidence map' by analyzing the relationships between these anchors, 4) Using this map to guide the model in calibrating its confidence for the original query. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, anchors might include relevant symptoms, potential conditions, and diagnostic procedures. The prompt would guide the model to assess its knowledge of each anchor, then use this to inform its overall confidence in the diagnosis.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) SciQ for scientific question answering, 2) MedQA for medical diagnosis tasks, and 3) LegalQA for legal reasoning tasks. Each dataset should contain at least 1000 questions with ground truth answers.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation (DCE): Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Logit-based confidence (LBC): Use the softmax output of the model's logits as a confidence measure. c) Ensemble-based confidence (EBC): Use the agreement among an ensemble of model runs as a confidence measure.",
            "Step 3: CCSA Implementation": "Implement the CCSA method with the following sub-steps: a) Semantic Anchor Generation: Prompt the model to generate 5-10 key concepts related to the query. b) Anchor Confidence Estimation: For each anchor, prompt the model to estimate its confidence in understanding the concept on a scale of 0-100. c) Semantic Confidence Map Construction: Analyze the relationships between anchors using cosine similarity of their embeddings. d) Final Confidence Calibration: Use the semantic confidence map to guide the model in calibrating its confidence for the original query.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and CCSA): a) Generate answers and confidence scores for all questions. b) Calculate evaluation metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, and accuracy. c) Perform 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust results.",
            "Step 5: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Evaluation": "Test the generalization ability of CCSA by evaluating on out-of-distribution tasks: a) Use models trained on SciQ to answer questions from a different scientific domain. b) Use models trained on MedQA to diagnose rare diseases not present in the training set. c) Use models trained on LegalQA to reason about hypothetical legal scenarios.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct detailed analysis of the results: a) Compare CCSA performance against baselines across all metrics and datasets. b) Analyze the effectiveness of CCSA in OOD scenarios. c) Investigate the relationship between semantic anchor relevance and confidence calibration accuracy. d) Examine cases where CCSA significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for a confidence score, which may not be well-calibrated."
            },
            "CCSA Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Generate 5 semantic anchors related to this question.",
                "Output": "Semantic Anchors: 1. European capitals, 2. French geography, 3. Major cities in France, 4. French government, 5. French history",
                "Next Input": "For each semantic anchor, rate your confidence in understanding it from 0 to 100.",
                "Next Output": "Confidence ratings: 1. European capitals: 90, 2. French geography: 85, 3. Major cities in France: 95, 4. French government: 80, 5. French history: 75",
                "Final Input": "Based on these semantic anchors and your confidence in them, what is the capital of France? Provide your answer and calibrated confidence level from 0 to 100.",
                "Final Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Calibrated Confidence: 92",
                "Explanation": "CCSA uses semantic anchors to ground the confidence estimation, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence scores."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCSA does not show significant improvements over baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of generated semantic anchors to identify potential improvements in the anchor generation process. 2) Analyzing the relationship between anchor confidence scores and final calibrated confidence to refine our calibration algorithm. 3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from CCSA, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Exploring variations of the semantic mapping process, such as using different similarity metrics or incorporating hierarchical relationships between concepts. 5) Combining CCSA with other calibration methods (e.g., temperature scaling) to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple techniques. If these analyses do not yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth study of why semantic grounding does not improve confidence calibration, potentially uncovering important insights about the nature of uncertainty in language models."
