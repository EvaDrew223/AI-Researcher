        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often fail to account for the temporal coherence of knowledge, leading to inconsistent confidence estimates across related queries over time.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches focus on point-in-time uncertainty estimates without considering how confidence might change with evolving knowledge or contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often gauge their confidence by considering how their knowledge might hold up to future scrutiny or related questions. By simulating this forward-thinking process, we might achieve more robust and temporally consistent uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation via Hypothetical Future Queries. This method involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) The model answers the original query and provides an initial confidence estimate. 2) The model is then prompted to generate a series of hypothetical future queries that could challenge or extend its current answer. 3) The model attempts to answer these hypothetical queries and estimates its confidence for each. 4) Finally, the model is instructed to reconcile its original confidence estimate with its performance on the hypothetical future queries, producing a revised uncertainty estimate that accounts for temporal coherence. This process encourages the model to consider the robustness and extensibility of its knowledge, potentially leading to more reliable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on longitudinal datasets where questions evolve over time or require consistent reasoning across related topics. Compare against standard point-in-time uncertainty estimation methods. Measure not only the accuracy of uncertainty estimates but also their consistency across related queries. Analyze the generated hypothetical future queries to gain insights into the model's reasoning about knowledge robustness."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation via Hypothetical Future Queries for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often fail to account for the temporal coherence of knowledge, leading to inconsistent confidence estimates across related queries over time. This problem is particularly significant in dynamic knowledge domains where information evolves rapidly, potentially causing language models to provide conflicting or outdated responses with misaligned confidence levels.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on point-in-time uncertainty estimates without considering how confidence might change with evolving knowledge or contexts. Human experts, however, often gauge their confidence by considering how their knowledge might hold up to future scrutiny or related questions. By simulating this forward-thinking process in language models, we aim to achieve more robust and temporally consistent uncertainty estimates. This approach could significantly improve the reliability and usefulness of language models in real-world applications where knowledge consistency over time is crucial.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation via Hypothetical Future Queries (TCUE-HFQ). This method involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) The model answers the original query and provides an initial confidence estimate. 2) The model is then prompted to generate a series of hypothetical future queries that could challenge or extend its current answer. 3) The model attempts to answer these hypothetical queries and estimates its confidence for each. 4) Finally, the model is instructed to reconcile its original confidence estimate with its performance on the hypothetical future queries, producing a revised uncertainty estimate that accounts for temporal coherence. This process encourages the model to consider the robustness and extensibility of its knowledge, potentially leading to more reliable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TemporalQuestions dataset, which contains questions about events and facts that change over time. We will also create a custom dataset by extracting time-sensitive questions from Wikipedia edit histories, focusing on topics that have undergone significant changes over time.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: a) Direct probability output from the model. b) Monte Carlo Dropout. c) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: TCUE-HFQ Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following steps: a) Initial answer and confidence estimation. b) Generation of hypothetical future queries. c) Answering hypothetical queries with confidence estimates. d) Reconciliation of confidence estimates.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error). b) Brier score. c) Temporal consistency score (a custom metric measuring the consistency of confidence estimates across related queries over time).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments comparing TCUE-HFQ against baseline methods on both datasets. For each question, we will generate responses and uncertainty estimates using all methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze the results, focusing on: a) Overall performance in terms of calibration and Brier score. b) Temporal consistency of uncertainty estimates. c) Qualitative analysis of generated hypothetical future queries and their impact on final estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who is the current President of the United States as of 2023?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Joe Biden is the current President of the United States as of 2023. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: Who is the current President of the United States as of 2023? Provide an answer and your confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "A: Joe Biden is the current President of the United States as of 2023. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Generate Hypothetical Future Queries)": "Generate 3 hypothetical future queries that could challenge or extend your knowledge about the current U.S. President:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Generate Hypothetical Future Queries)": "1. Who will be Joe Biden's main opponent in the 2024 presidential election?\n2. What major policy changes has President Biden implemented in his first term?\n3. How has President Biden's approval rating changed since his inauguration?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Answer Hypothetical Queries)": "Please answer the following hypothetical future queries and provide a confidence level for each:\n1. Who will be Joe Biden's main opponent in the 2024 presidential election?\n2. What major policy changes has President Biden implemented in his first term?\n3. How has President Biden's approval rating changed since his inauguration?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Answer Hypothetical Queries)": "1. As of 2023, it's unclear who Joe Biden's main opponent will be in the 2024 election. Several Republican candidates have announced their intentions to run, but the primary process has not yet determined the nominee. Confidence: 60%\n2. President Biden has implemented several major policy changes, including the American Rescue Plan, infrastructure investment, and climate change initiatives. However, without access to the most current information, I can't provide an exhaustive list. Confidence: 80%\n3. President Biden's approval rating has fluctuated since his inauguration, influenced by factors such as the COVID-19 response, economic conditions, and foreign policy decisions. Without access to the most recent polling data, I can't provide specific numbers or trends. Confidence: 70%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Reconcile Confidence Estimates)": "Based on your initial answer and confidence level, and your responses to the hypothetical future queries, provide a revised confidence level for your knowledge about the current U.S. President, explaining your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Reconcile Confidence Estimates)": "Revised Confidence: 85%\nReasoning: While I'm highly confident (95%) about Joe Biden being the current U.S. President, the hypothetical future queries revealed some uncertainties in my knowledge about his presidency and future political landscape. I'm less certain about future events (like the 2024 election) and ongoing developments (like approval ratings and policy impacts). This suggests that while my core knowledge is strong, there are aspects of the presidency that are subject to change or require more current information. Therefore, I've slightly reduced my overall confidence to 85% to reflect these temporal uncertainties.",
            "explanation": "The TCUE-HFQ method demonstrates a more nuanced approach to uncertainty estimation. While the baseline method provides a single high confidence score, our proposed method considers potential future developments and knowledge gaps, resulting in a more calibrated and temporally aware confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCUE-HFQ method doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated hypothetical future queries to understand what types of questions the model considers relevant for future uncertainty. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning about knowledge temporality. Second, we could investigate how different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. predictive) affect the model's confidence reconciliation process. This might lead to a more refined method that applies different strategies based on question type. Lastly, we could explore combining TCUE-HFQ with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies. These alternative directions could still yield valuable insights into temporal aspects of language model uncertainty, even if the original method doesn't meet our initial performance expectations."
