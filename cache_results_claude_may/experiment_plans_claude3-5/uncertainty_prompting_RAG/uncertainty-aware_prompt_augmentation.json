    "idea_name": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Augmentation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions on unfamiliar or ambiguous inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling or ensemble methods often require model modifications or multiple forward passes.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically augmenting prompts with uncertainty-eliciting questions, we can encourage models to introspect on their knowledge limitations without architectural changes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Augmentation (UAPA), which dynamically injects uncertainty-probing sub-prompts into the main task prompt. UAPA uses a meta-prompt to generate task-specific uncertainty questions (e.g., 'What aspects of this question are unclear?', 'What information might be missing to answer confidently?'). These questions are then interleaved with the original prompt, encouraging the model to consider potential sources of uncertainty before responding. The final output combines the task response with an explicit uncertainty assessment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate UAPA against standard prompting on diverse tasks including open-domain QA, commonsense reasoning, and out-of-distribution detection. Measure improvements in calibration, selective prediction accuracy, and correlation between expressed uncertainty and error rates."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Augmentation: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions on unfamiliar or ambiguous inputs. This overconfidence can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, often require model modifications or multiple forward passes, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for many real-world applications. By dynamically augmenting prompts with uncertainty-eliciting questions, we can encourage models to introspect on their knowledge limitations without architectural changes. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to improve uncertainty estimation, potentially leading to better-calibrated outputs across a wide range of tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Augmentation (UAPA), which dynamically injects uncertainty-probing sub-prompts into the main task prompt. UAPA uses a meta-prompt to generate task-specific uncertainty questions (e.g., 'What aspects of this question are unclear?', 'What information might be missing to answer confidently?'). These questions are then interleaved with the original prompt, encouraging the model to consider potential sources of uncertainty before responding. The final output combines the task response with an explicit uncertainty assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate UAPA: (1) TruthfulQA for open-domain question answering, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) CLINC150 for out-of-distribution intent detection.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Standard prompting, (2) Few-shot prompting with 3 examples, and (3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.",
            "Step 3: UAPA Implementation": "Implement the UAPA method in three stages: (a) Meta-prompt generation, (b) Uncertainty question generation, and (c) Final prompt construction.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Accuracy, (2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (3) Brier Score, and (4) Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic curve (AUCE).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments for each dataset and model combination, using both baseline methods and UAPA.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of UAPA against baselines across all metrics and datasets. Conduct ablation studies on the number and types of uncertainty questions."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\n\nBefore answering, let's consider some uncertainty questions:\n1. Are there any ambiguities in the question?\n2. Is there any missing information that could affect the answer?\n3. How confident are you in your knowledge about France's capital?\n\nNow, please provide your answer along with an uncertainty assessment:\n\nA:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Based on the uncertainty questions:\n1. There are no apparent ambiguities in the question.\n2. No critical information seems to be missing to answer this question.\n3. I am highly confident in my knowledge about France's capital.\n\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nUncertainty assessment: I am very confident (95% certain) in this answer. The capital of France being Paris is a well-established fact that has remained unchanged for centuries and is widely known.",
            "Explanation": "The UAPA method encourages the model to explicitly consider sources of uncertainty before providing an answer. This results in a more nuanced response that includes both the answer and an assessment of the model's confidence, which can be valuable for downstream decision-making processes."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UAPA does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the generated uncertainty questions to ensure they are relevant and diverse. We could also explore variations of the method, such as using a fixed set of pre-defined uncertainty questions instead of generating them dynamically. Additionally, we might investigate whether UAPA is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply uncertainty-aware prompting. If these approaches don't yield improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper comparing different prompting strategies for uncertainty quantification, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of various methods across different tasks and model sizes."
