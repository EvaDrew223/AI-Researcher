        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide fine-grained uncertainty estimates for complex queries that involve multiple sub-components or layers of reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically provide a single, high-level uncertainty estimate without breaking down the sources of uncertainty in complex reasoning chains.",
        "Motivation": "Complex queries often involve multiple steps or components, each with its own sources of uncertainty. By recursively decomposing the query and estimating uncertainty at each level, we can obtain a more detailed and accurate overall uncertainty assessment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition (RUD), a prompting technique that breaks down complex queries into sub-components and recursively estimates uncertainty at each level. The process involves: 1) Query decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the query into sub-questions or reasoning steps. 2) Recursive prompting: For each sub-component, recursively apply the uncertainty estimation prompt, potentially further decomposing if necessary. 3) Uncertainty aggregation: Use a bottom-up approach to aggregate uncertainties, prompting the model with: \"Given the uncertainty estimates for each sub-component [list estimates], how does this affect the overall uncertainty for the original query? Explain your reasoning.\" This recursive approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of where uncertainty originates in complex reasoning chains.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate RUD on tasks involving multi-step reasoning, such as complex mathematical word problems, multi-hop question answering, or intricate logical puzzles. Compare against flat uncertainty estimation methods, using metrics that capture both overall calibration and the quality of uncertainty decomposition. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated uncertainty trees to assess their interpretability and usefulness."

        "Title": "Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide fine-grained uncertainty estimates for complex queries that involve multiple sub-components or layers of reasoning. This limitation hinders their reliability and interpretability in high-stakes applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically provide a single, high-level uncertainty estimate without breaking down the sources of uncertainty in complex reasoning chains. Complex queries often involve multiple steps or components, each with its own sources of uncertainty. By recursively decomposing the query and estimating uncertainty at each level, we can obtain a more detailed and accurate overall uncertainty assessment. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems and assess our confidence in each step separately.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition (RUD), a prompting technique that breaks down complex queries into sub-components and recursively estimates uncertainty at each level. The process involves three main steps: 1) Query decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the query into sub-questions or reasoning steps. 2) Recursive prompting: For each sub-component, recursively apply the uncertainty estimation prompt, potentially further decomposing if necessary. 3) Uncertainty aggregation: Use a bottom-up approach to aggregate uncertainties, prompting the model to combine the sub-component uncertainties into an overall uncertainty estimate for the original query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use three datasets that involve multi-step reasoning: 1) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving, 2) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, and 3) EntailmentBank for multi-step entailment tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with uncertainty estimation, where we ask the model to solve the problem and provide a single uncertainty estimate. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with uncertainty estimation, where we ask the model to show its reasoning steps and provide an overall uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 3: RUD Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition method: a) Query decomposition prompt: 'Break down this problem into smaller sub-questions or reasoning steps:' b) Recursive uncertainty estimation prompt: 'Solve this sub-question and provide your confidence level (0-100%):' c) Uncertainty aggregation prompt: 'Given the uncertainty estimates for each sub-component [list estimates], how does this affect the overall uncertainty for the original query? Explain your reasoning and provide a final uncertainty estimate (0-100%).'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Accuracy of final answers, 2) Calibration error (comparing estimated uncertainty with actual correctness), 3) Sharpness of uncertainty estimates, 4) Decomposition quality (human evaluation of the relevance and completeness of sub-questions).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods on all examples. b) Run the RUD method on all examples. c) Collect final answers, uncertainty estimates, and intermediate reasoning steps.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the accuracy and calibration of RUD against baselines. 2) Analyze the structure and depth of uncertainty decompositions. 3) Investigate cases where RUD significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines. 4) Examine the relationship between decomposition quality and final performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and then at 30 mph for 1 hour, what is the average speed of the entire journey? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%) in your solution.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours:\n   60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n2. Distance traveled in the last hour:\n   30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles\n\n3. Total distance:\n   120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles\n\n4. Total time:\n   2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\n5. Average speed:\n   Average speed = Total distance / Total time\n   = 150 miles / 3 hours\n   = 50 mph\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the entire journey is 50 mph.\n\nConfidence level: 95%\n\nI'm quite confident in this solution as it involves straightforward calculations and follows the standard formula for average speed. The only potential source of error could be a minor arithmetic mistake, but I've double-checked my calculations.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUD; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "Q: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and then at 30 mph for 1 hour, what is the average speed of the entire journey? Break down this problem into smaller sub-questions or reasoning steps:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUD; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "1. What is the distance traveled in the first 2 hours?\n2. What is the distance traveled in the last hour?\n3. What is the total distance traveled?\n4. What is the total time of the journey?\n5. How do we calculate the average speed?\n6. What is the final average speed?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUD; Step 2: Recursive Uncertainty Estimation)": "Solve each sub-question and provide your confidence level (0-100%) for each:\n1. What is the distance traveled in the first 2 hours?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUD; Step 2: Recursive Uncertainty Estimation)": "1. The distance traveled in the first 2 hours:\n   Distance = Speed * Time\n   Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nConfidence: 99%\n\nI'm very confident in this calculation as it's a simple multiplication of two given values.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUD; Step 3: Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Given the uncertainty estimates for each sub-component:\n1. Distance in first 2 hours: 99%\n2. Distance in last hour: 99%\n3. Total distance: 98%\n4. Total time: 100%\n5. Average speed calculation method: 100%\n6. Final average speed calculation: 97%\n\nHow does this affect the overall uncertainty for the original query? Explain your reasoning and provide a final uncertainty estimate (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (RUD; Step 3: Uncertainty Aggregation)": "To determine the overall uncertainty, we need to consider how each sub-component contributes to the final result and how their individual uncertainties propagate.\n\n1. The distances (steps 1-3) are crucial for the final calculation. Their high confidence (98-99%) is positive, but even small errors could affect the final result.\n\n2. The total time (step 4) has 100% confidence, which is excellent as it's a simple addition of given values.\n\n3. The method for calculating average speed (step 5) is also at 100%, which is great because it means we're certain about the formula to use.\n\n4. The final calculation (step 6) has a slightly lower confidence at 97%, which likely accounts for potential compounding of small errors from previous steps.\n\nThe overall process involves multiplication and division, which can amplify small errors. However, the high confidence in most steps is reassuring.\n\nConsidering all factors, I would estimate the overall confidence for the original query to be 96%.\n\nThis is slightly lower than the confidence in the final calculation step (97%) to account for the small uncertainties in the distance calculations that feed into the final result. However, it remains high due to the overall high confidence levels in each step and the straightforward nature of the calculations involved.",
            "explanation": "The RUD method provides a more detailed breakdown of the problem-solving process and uncertainty estimation. It allows for identifying specific areas of lower confidence (if any) and provides a more nuanced final uncertainty estimate based on the propagation of uncertainties through the problem-solving steps."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the RUD method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the decomposition structures generated by RUD to understand patterns in how LLMs break down complex problems. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process. 2) Investigate the relationship between decomposition quality and final performance, which could lead to insights on how to improve prompting strategies for complex reasoning tasks. 3) Analyze cases where RUD underperforms compared to baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the method or in the model's ability to decompose certain types of problems. 4) Explore variations of the RUD method, such as different prompting strategies for decomposition or alternative methods for uncertainty aggregation. 5) Investigate how RUD performs across different types of reasoning tasks to understand its strengths and limitations in various domains. These analyses could turn the project into an insightful study on LLM reasoning and uncertainty estimation, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
