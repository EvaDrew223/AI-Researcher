    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when presented with complete information upfront, leading to overconfidence in partial knowledge scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Traditional methods typically provide all available information at once, which can lead to premature confidence assessments.",
        "Motivation": "By gradually revealing information and tracking confidence changes, we can better simulate real-world uncertainty scenarios and improve calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Gradual Information Unveiling (GIU), a dynamic prompting strategy that incrementally reveals task-relevant information while continuously assessing the model's confidence. The process involves: 1) Initial prompt with minimal information, 2) Iterative information addition through carefully crafted prompts, 3) Confidence assessment at each stage, 4) Detection of confidence inflection points, and 5) Final calibrated confidence output based on the confidence trajectory. This method allows us to identify the exact point where the model's confidence significantly changes, providing insight into its uncertainty dynamics.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare GIU with standard prompting on tasks where information can be naturally segmented (e.g., multi-hop reasoning, incremental fact-checking). Evaluate using calibration metrics and analyze the relationship between information quantity and confidence levels."

        "Title": "Gradual Information Unveiling: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when presented with complete information upfront, leading to overconfidence in partial knowledge scenarios. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and misplaced trust in model predictions, particularly in high-stakes applications where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically provide all available information at once, which can lead to premature confidence assessments. By gradually revealing information and tracking confidence changes, we can better simulate real-world uncertainty scenarios and improve calibration. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where confidence in a decision often evolves as more information becomes available. Our method aims to leverage the LLM's ability to reason over incrementally presented information, potentially leading to more nuanced and better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Gradual Information Unveiling (GIU), a dynamic prompting strategy that incrementally reveals task-relevant information while continuously assessing the model's confidence. The process involves: 1) Initial prompt with minimal information, 2) Iterative information addition through carefully crafted prompts, 3) Confidence assessment at each stage, 4) Detection of confidence inflection points, and 5) Final calibrated confidence output based on the confidence trajectory. This method allows us to identify the exact point where the model's confidence significantly changes, providing insight into its uncertainty dynamics.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that can be naturally segmented into incremental information pieces. We will use: 1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking, 2) MultiRC for multi-hop reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for science question answering. For each dataset, create a version where information is split into 3-5 segments that can be revealed incrementally.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baselines: 1) Standard prompting: Present the full information at once and ask for an answer with confidence. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Present full information and ask the model to think step-by-step before providing an answer with confidence.",
            "Step 3: GIU Implementation": "Implement the GIU method: a) Create an initial prompt with minimal information. b) Design prompts for each information segment. c) Implement a confidence querying mechanism after each segment. d) Develop a method to detect confidence inflection points. e) Create a final prompt that synthesizes the information and confidence trajectory.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run baseline methods. b) Run GIU method. c) Collect model outputs, including intermediate confidence scores for GIU.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate using: 1) Accuracy of final answers. 2) Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, Maximum Calibration Error). 3) Confidence trajectory analysis (e.g., area under the confidence curve, rate of change).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare GIU performance against baselines. Analyze confidence trajectories to identify patterns in information impact on model certainty. Investigate cases where GIU significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: The first electric traffic signal was installed in which city? A) Cleveland, Ohio B) New York City, New York C) Chicago, Illinois D) Los Angeles, California\nProvide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "Answer: A) Cleveland, Ohio\nConfidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GIU; Step 1)": "Q: We're going to discuss the first electric traffic signal. What's your initial guess about where it might have been installed? Provide an answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GIU; Step 1)": "Initial guess: New York City, New York\nConfidence: 30%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GIU; Step 2)": "Additional information: The first electric traffic signal was installed in a Midwestern city. Update your answer and confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GIU; Step 2)": "Updated answer: Chicago, Illinois\nConfidence: 60%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GIU; Step 3)": "Final piece of information: The city where the first electric traffic signal was installed is known for its rock and roll hall of fame. Provide your final answer and confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GIU; Step 3)": "Final answer: Cleveland, Ohio\nConfidence: 90%",
            "Explanation": "The GIU method allows the model to adjust its answer and confidence as new information is presented, potentially leading to a more calibrated final confidence score compared to the baseline method where the model might be overconfident with limited information."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the GIU method doesn't show significant improvements in calibration, we can explore several alternatives: 1) Analyze the confidence trajectories to understand why the method didn't work as expected. This could reveal insights about how LLMs process incremental information. 2) Experiment with different segmentation strategies for the information unveiling process. Perhaps certain types of information ordering lead to better calibration. 3) Implement a hybrid approach combining GIU with other prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought or Self-Consistency to see if this yields better results. 4) Investigate whether GIU performs differently across various types of tasks (e.g., factual recall vs. reasoning tasks) and focus on the areas where it shows the most promise. 5) If the results are interesting but don't show clear improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper examining how LLMs' confidence changes with incremental information, which could provide valuable insights for future calibration research."
