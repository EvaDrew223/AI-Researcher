    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that involve multiple sub-components.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods often fail to capture fine-grained uncertainty across different aspects of a query.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing complex queries into sub-components and evaluating uncertainty separately for each part, we can obtain a more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Bifurcation (UPB), which recursively splits a complex query into simpler sub-queries. For each sub-query, we prompt the model to provide both an answer and a confidence score. We then use a novel aggregation method to combine these sub-confidences, weighing them based on their relevance to the original query. This process continues recursively until reaching a predefined granularity or confidence threshold. The final uncertainty estimate is computed using a weighted combination of all sub-confidences, capturing uncertainty at multiple levels of abstraction.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UPB against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on complex reasoning tasks from benchmarks like MMLU and BigBench. We'll measure performance using metrics like calibration error, Brier score, and correlation between estimated uncertainty and actual error rates."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Bifurcation: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that involve multiple sub-components. This leads to overconfident predictions on incorrect answers and underconfident predictions on correct answers, reducing the reliability and interpretability of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods often fail to capture fine-grained uncertainty across different aspects of a query. By decomposing complex queries into sub-components and evaluating uncertainty separately for each part, we can obtain a more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimate. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often break down complex problems into simpler parts and assess our confidence in each part separately before combining them for a final judgment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Bifurcation (UPB), which recursively splits a complex query into simpler sub-queries. For each sub-query, we prompt the model to provide both an answer and a confidence score. We then use a novel aggregation method to combine these sub-confidences, weighing them based on their relevance to the original query. This process continues recursively until reaching a predefined granularity or confidence threshold. The final uncertainty estimate is computed using a weighted combination of all sub-confidences, capturing uncertainty at multiple levels of abstraction.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for evaluating performance on diverse academic subjects. 2) BigBench for complex reasoning tasks. 3) TruthfulQA for assessing model calibration on questions where models are prone to hallucination.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. b) Ensemble method: Use 5 different few-shot prompts and average the confidence scores. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and estimate uncertainty from the variance of multiple forward passes.",
            "Step 3: UPB Implementation": "Implement the UPB method as follows: a) Query Decomposition: Use GPT-4 to generate a decomposition tree for each query, breaking it into sub-queries. b) Sub-query Confidence Elicitation: For each sub-query, use the prompt 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence on a scale of 0-100: [sub-query]'. c) Confidence Aggregation: Implement a weighted sum of sub-confidences, with weights determined by relevance scores provided by GPT-4.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and UPB): a) Generate answers and confidence scores for all queries. b) Calculate performance metrics: accuracy, calibration error, Brier score, and ECE (Expected Calibration Error). c) Analyze the correlation between estimated uncertainty and actual error rates.",
            "Step 5: Ablation Studies": "Conduct the following ablations: a) Vary the depth of query decomposition in UPB. b) Compare different aggregation methods for sub-confidences. c) Analyze the impact of using different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4) for different steps in UPB.",
            "Step 6: Analysis and Visualization": "a) Generate calibration plots comparing predicted confidence vs. empirical accuracy for each method. b) Visualize query decomposition trees and their associated confidence scores. c) Analyze cases where UPB significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for confidence after the answer, which may not accurately reflect uncertainty in complex queries."
            },
            "UPB Example": {
                "Input": "Q: In the context of climate change, how might rising sea levels affect coastal cities' infrastructure and economy by 2050?",
                "Step 1: Decomposition": "Sub-queries: 1) What are the projected sea level rises by 2050? 2) How does sea level rise affect coastal infrastructure? 3) What are the economic implications of damaged coastal infrastructure?",
                "Step 2: Sub-query Confidence Elicitation": "For each sub-query: Answer the following question and provide your confidence on a scale of 0-100: [sub-query]",
                "Step 3: Aggregation": "Combine sub-confidences using relevance-weighted sum",
                "Output": "A: Rising sea levels due to climate change are projected to significantly impact coastal cities' infrastructure and economy by 2050. Infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and utilities near the coast may be damaged or require costly adaptations. Economically, this could lead to decreased property values, increased insurance costs, and potential loss of tourism revenue. The severity of these impacts will vary by location and depend on mitigation efforts. Overall confidence: 82%",
                "Explanation": "UPB breaks down the complex query, allowing for more nuanced confidence assessment and a more detailed, well-calibrated response."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UPB doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why decomposition doesn't improve calibration as expected. We'll conduct a detailed error analysis, examining cases where UPB fails and succeeds. We can investigate whether certain types of questions benefit more from decomposition than others. Additionally, we'll explore alternative decomposition strategies, such as using different prompts for query splitting or employing a fixed set of sub-queries for specific domains. We could also investigate the relationship between query complexity and the effectiveness of decomposition, potentially leading to insights on when to apply UPB versus simpler methods. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty in language models and guide future research in this area."
