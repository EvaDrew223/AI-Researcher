    "idea_name": "Recursive Confidence Distillation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, particularly for complex tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning or integration of diverse knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on end-to-end uncertainty estimation, neglecting the potential for improving calibration through step-wise confidence assessment and refinement.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of knowledge distillation in machine learning and the human cognitive process of iterative self-reflection, we propose that model uncertainty can be more accurately quantified through a recursive process of confidence estimation and refinement.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Distillation (RCD), an iterative prompting technique that progressively refines uncertainty estimates through a series of self-reflective steps. The method works as follows: 1) Initial decomposition: The model breaks down the task into a series of sub-steps or components. 2) Component-wise confidence estimation: For each component, the model provides an initial confidence estimate and justification. 3) Recursive refinement: The model then 'zooms in' on each component, further decomposing it and reassessing its confidence at this finer granularity. 4) Confidence propagation: As the model recursively refines its estimates, it propagates confidence information up and down the decomposition hierarchy, allowing for bidirectional influence between high-level and low-level estimates. 5) Distillation: Finally, the model distills these multi-level, recursively refined estimates into a final uncertainty quantification, accompanied by a detailed explanation of its confidence reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate RCD against standard uncertainty quantification methods on a variety of complex reasoning tasks, including multi-hop inference, logical deduction, and interdisciplinary analysis. We'll measure not only the final calibration and sharpness of uncertainty estimates, but also track how these estimates evolve through the recursive process. We'll conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of the method, and perform a qualitative analysis of the generated confidence reasoning explanations."

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Distillation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models through Iterative Self-Reflection",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, particularly for complex tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning or integration of diverse knowledge. This issue is especially pronounced in scenarios where models need to combine information from various domains or perform multi-step reasoning, leading to overconfident predictions on incorrect outputs or underconfident predictions on correct outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in language models typically focus on end-to-end methods, neglecting the potential for improving calibration through step-wise confidence assessment and refinement. Inspired by the concept of knowledge distillation in machine learning and the human cognitive process of iterative self-reflection, we propose that model uncertainty can be more accurately quantified through a recursive process of confidence estimation and refinement. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to decompose complex tasks, assess confidence at various levels of granularity, and iteratively refine these estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Distillation (RCD), an iterative prompting technique that progressively refines uncertainty estimates through a series of self-reflective steps. The method works as follows: 1) Initial decomposition: The model breaks down the task into a series of sub-steps or components. 2) Component-wise confidence estimation: For each component, the model provides an initial confidence estimate and justification. 3) Recursive refinement: The model then 'zooms in' on each component, further decomposing it and reassessing its confidence at this finer granularity. 4) Confidence propagation: As the model recursively refines its estimates, it propagates confidence information up and down the decomposition hierarchy, allowing for bidirectional influence between high-level and low-level estimates. 5) Distillation: Finally, the model distills these multi-level, recursively refined estimates into a final uncertainty quantification, accompanied by a detailed explanation of its confidence reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require complex reasoning: 1) MultiArith: a dataset of multi-step arithmetic word problems, 2) StrategyQA: a dataset requiring implicit multi-hop reasoning, and 3) HotpotQA: a dataset for multi-hop question answering. These datasets will be split into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation, and 3) Calibrated few-shot prompting. For each method, prompt the model to provide both an answer and a confidence score (0-100%).",
            "Step 3: RCD Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Confidence Distillation method. This involves creating prompts for each step of the RCD process: decomposition, initial confidence estimation, recursive refinement, confidence propagation, and final distillation. Use few-shot examples to guide the model through each step.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model, with GPT-3.5-turbo as a secondary model for comparison. Both models will be accessed through the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Accuracy: measure the correctness of the final answers. 2) Calibration error: compute the difference between confidence estimates and actual accuracy. 3) Sharpness: measure the concentration of the confidence distribution. 4) Brier score: combine accuracy and calibration into a single metric.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run the baseline methods and collect results. 2) Run the RCD method and collect results. 3) Compute all evaluation metrics for both baselines and RCD.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare RCD performance against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze how confidence estimates evolve through the recursive process. 3) Examine the relationship between task decomposition granularity and final calibration. 4) Investigate cases where RCD significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components: 1) Remove the recursive refinement step. 2) Remove the confidence propagation step. 3) Vary the depth of recursion. 4) Compare against a non-recursive multi-step confidence estimation process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: If John has 5 apples and buys 3 more, then gives 2 to his friend, how many apples does he have left? Provide your answer and your confidence in the answer (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: John has 6 apples left. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Decomposition)": "Q: If John has 5 apples and buys 3 more, then gives 2 to his friend, how many apples does he have left? Please decompose this problem into steps.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. Calculate initial number of apples\n2. Add newly bought apples\n3. Subtract apples given to friend\n4. Determine final number of apples",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Initial Confidence Estimation)": "For each step, provide an initial confidence estimate (0-100%) and a brief justification:\n1. Calculate initial number of apples\n2. Add newly bought apples\n3. Subtract apples given to friend\n4. Determine final number of apples",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Initial Confidence Estimation)": "1. Calculate initial number of apples - Confidence: 100% (Directly stated in the problem)\n2. Add newly bought apples - Confidence: 100% (Simple addition)\n3. Subtract apples given to friend - Confidence: 100% (Simple subtraction)\n4. Determine final number of apples - Confidence: 98% (Combines previous steps, small chance of calculation error)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Recursive Refinement)": "Let's zoom in on step 4: Determine final number of apples. Can you break this down further and reassess your confidence?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Recursive Refinement)": "Step 4 breakdown:\na) Recall result from step 2 (8 apples) - Confidence: 99% (Might misremember)\nb) Recall number of apples given away (2) - Confidence: 100% (Directly stated)\nc) Perform subtraction (8 - 2) - Confidence: 99.5% (Simple subtraction, but tiny chance of error)\nOverall confidence for step 4: 98.5% (Slightly higher due to detailed breakdown)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Distillation)": "Based on your decomposition, initial confidence estimates, and recursive refinement, provide a final answer to the original question with an overall confidence estimate and explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Distillation)": "Final Answer: John has 6 apples left.\nOverall Confidence: 98.5%\nExplanation: The problem was broken down into clear steps, each with high confidence. The final step was further decomposed, revealing high confidence in each sub-step. The slight uncertainty comes from the small possibility of calculation errors in the addition and subtraction steps, but the simplicity of the arithmetic involved keeps this risk very low.",
            "Explanation": "The RCD method provides a more nuanced and justified confidence estimate compared to the baseline. It breaks down the problem, assesses confidence at each step, and then recursively refines the estimate for the most critical step. This process allows for a more thorough examination of potential sources of uncertainty, leading to a well-calibrated final confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RCD method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will pivot to an in-depth analysis of the recursive confidence estimation process. We will examine: 1) How confidence estimates change at different levels of recursion, 2) Whether certain types of problems benefit more from recursive decomposition than others, 3) The relationship between problem complexity and the optimal depth of recursion, and 4) How the model's explanations for its confidence estimates evolve through the recursive process. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of language models in meta-cognitive tasks, potentially leading to the development of new prompting strategies or model architectures that are better suited for uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we could explore combining RCD with other techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibrated few-shot learning, to see if hybrid approaches yield better results."
