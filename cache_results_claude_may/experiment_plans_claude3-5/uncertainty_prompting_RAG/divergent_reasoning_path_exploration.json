        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when multiple valid reasoning paths lead to different conclusions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-path reasoning or limited exploration of alternative hypotheses.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly exploring multiple, potentially conflicting reasoning paths, we can better gauge model uncertainty and identify cases where confident answers may be unwarranted.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Divergent Reasoning Path Exploration (DRPE), a prompting technique that guides the model to generate and evaluate multiple distinct reasoning paths for a given problem. The prompt structure includes: 1) Problem statement, 2) Instruction to generate N diverse reasoning paths, 3) Evaluation of each path's strengths and weaknesses, 4) Synthesis of findings and uncertainty quantification. DRPE encourages the model to consider conflicting evidence and reasoning strategies, leading to more nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare DRPE with standard prompting and chain-of-thought approaches on reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH. Evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates using metrics like calibration error and Brier score, as well as the diversity and validity of generated reasoning paths."

        "Title": "Divergent Reasoning Path Exploration: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when multiple valid reasoning paths lead to different conclusions. This issue can result in overconfident predictions in ambiguous scenarios, potentially leading to misinformation or poor decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-path reasoning or limited exploration of alternative hypotheses, which may not fully capture the complexity and ambiguity inherent in many reasoning tasks. By explicitly exploring multiple, potentially conflicting reasoning paths, we can better gauge model uncertainty and identify cases where confident answers may be unwarranted. This approach aligns with human cognitive processes, where considering multiple perspectives often leads to more nuanced and reliable conclusions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Divergent Reasoning Path Exploration (DRPE), a prompting technique that guides the model to generate and evaluate multiple distinct reasoning paths for a given problem. The DRPE prompt structure includes: 1) Problem statement, 2) Instruction to generate N diverse reasoning paths, 3) Evaluation of each path's strengths and weaknesses, 4) Synthesis of findings and uncertainty quantification.

            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K (for mathematical reasoning) and MATH (for advanced mathematical reasoning). Choose a diverse set of 100 problems from each dataset, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels and problem types.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Standard prompting: directly asking the model to solve the problem, b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: instructing the model to show its work step-by-step.",
            "Step 3: DRPE Implementation": "Develop the DRPE prompting structure with the following components: a) Problem statement, b) Instruction to generate 3 diverse reasoning paths, c) Evaluation prompt for each path, d) Synthesis and uncertainty quantification prompt.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo to assess performance differences across model sizes.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the dataset: a) Apply standard prompting, b) Apply CoT prompting, c) Apply DRPE prompting. Record all outputs, including intermediate steps for DRPE.",
            "Step 6: Uncertainty Quantification": "For DRPE outputs, extract the model's uncertainty estimate. For baseline methods, use the model's confidence score (if available) or implement a simple heuristic based on output consistency across multiple runs.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Assess performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: percentage of correct final answers, b) Calibration error: difference between model confidence and actual accuracy, c) Brier score: measure of probabilistic forecast accuracy, d) Path diversity: measure the semantic diversity of generated reasoning paths using embedding similarity.",
            "Step 8: Human Evaluation": "Randomly select 50 problems and have human experts rate the quality and validity of the generated reasoning paths, as well as the appropriateness of the uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Compare DRPE performance against baselines. Analyze cases where DRPE significantly improves or underperforms. Investigate the relationship between path diversity and uncertainty estimates."

                "Problem": "A store sells red and blue marbles. If there are 3 times as many red marbles as blue marbles, and the total number of marbles is 80, how many blue marbles are there?",
                "Standard Prompt": "Solve the following problem: A store sells red and blue marbles. If there are 3 times as many red marbles as blue marbles, and the total number of marbles is 80, how many blue marbles are there?",
                "Standard Output": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Let x be the number of blue marbles.\n2. Then, 3x is the number of red marbles.\n3. The total number of marbles is 80, so we can write an equation:\n   x + 3x = 80\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   4x = 80\n5. Solve for x:\n   x = 80 \u00f7 4 = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 20 blue marbles.",
                "CoT Prompt": "Solve the following problem step by step: A store sells red and blue marbles. If there are 3 times as many red marbles as blue marbles, and the total number of marbles is 80, how many blue marbles are there?",
                "CoT Output": "Let's solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. Let's define variables:\n   Let b = number of blue marbles\n   Let r = number of red marbles\n\n2. We know that there are 3 times as many red marbles as blue marbles:\n   r = 3b\n\n3. We also know that the total number of marbles is 80:\n   b + r = 80\n\n4. Substitute r with 3b in the total marbles equation:\n   b + 3b = 80\n   4b = 80\n\n5. Solve for b:\n   b = 80 \u00f7 4\n   b = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 20 blue marbles.",

If there are 3 times as many red marbles as blue marbles, and the total number of marbles is 80, how many blue marbles are there?\n\n1. Generate 3 diverse reasoning paths to solve this problem.\n2. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each reasoning path.\n3. Synthesize the findings and provide an uncertainty quantification for the final answer.",
                "DRPE Output": "1. Generating 3 diverse reasoning paths:\n\nPath A (Algebraic):\n1. Let x be the number of blue marbles.\n2. Then, 3x is the number of red marbles.\n3. Total marbles: x + 3x = 80\n4. Simplify: 4x = 80\n5. Solve: x = 80 \u00f7 4 = 20\nConclusion: There are 20 blue marbles.\n\nPath B (Proportion-based):\n1. Total parts: 1 (blue) + 3 (red) = 4 parts\n2. Each part represents: 80 \u00f7 4 = 20 marbles\n3. Blue marbles = 1 part = 20 marbles\nConclusion: There are 20 blue marbles.\n\nPath C (Trial and Error):\n1. Guess 15 blue marbles:\n   15 blue + 45 red (3 * 15) = 60 total (too low)\n2. Guess 25 blue marbles:\n   25 blue + 75 red (3 * 25) = 100 total (too high)\n3. Guess 20 blue marbles:\n   20 blue + 60 red (3 * 20) = 80 total (correct)\nConclusion: There are 20 blue marbles.\n\n2. Evaluating strengths and weaknesses:\n\nPath A (Algebraic):\nStrengths: Precise, systematic, and generalizable to similar problems.\nWeaknesses: Requires algebraic knowledge, may be prone to calculation errors.\n\nPath B (Proportion-based):\nStrengths: Intuitive, visual, and easy to understand for non-technical audiences.\nWeaknesses: May be less precise for more complex ratios, rounding errors possible.\n\nPath C (Trial and Error):\nStrengths: Concrete, verifiable, and doesn't require advanced math skills.\nWeaknesses: Time-consuming, may not work for larger numbers or more complex problems.\n\n3. Synthesis and uncertainty quantification:\n\nAll three reasoning paths converge on the same answer: 20 blue marbles. This consistency across different approaches increases our confidence in the result. However, there are potential sources of uncertainty:\n\n1. Interpretation: The problem assumes a whole number of marbles. In real-world scenarios, fractions of marbles might be possible, leading to different results.\n2. Precision: The problem doesn't specify if rounding is allowed, which could affect the answer for more complex ratios.\n3. Human error: Each method is susceptible to calculation mistakes, especially the algebraic approach.\n\nUncertainty quantification:\nGiven the convergence of multiple reasoning paths and the straightforward nature of the problem, we can assign a high confidence to the answer of 20 blue marbles. On a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 represents absolute certainty, we can quantify our uncertainty as follows:\n\nConfidence: 0.95 (95% certain)\nUncertainty: 0.05 (5% uncertain)\n\nThis small uncertainty accounts for potential misinterpretations or edge cases not considered in our reasoning paths.",

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DRPE method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification or calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where DRPE performs poorly, identifying patterns or problem types that challenge the method. This could lead to insights about LLM reasoning limitations. 2) Explore variations of DRPE, such as increasing the number of reasoning paths or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide path generation. 3) Investigate the relationship between path diversity and answer correctness/uncertainty, which could inform future prompting strategies. 4) Analyze the language and structure of generated reasoning paths to understand how LLMs approach different problem types, potentially revealing biases or heuristics used by the models. 5) Compare DRPE performance across different model sizes and architectures to gain insights into how reasoning capabilities scale with model size. These alternative directions could transform the project into a comprehensive analysis of LLM reasoning strategies and uncertainty handling, providing valuable insights for future research in this area."
