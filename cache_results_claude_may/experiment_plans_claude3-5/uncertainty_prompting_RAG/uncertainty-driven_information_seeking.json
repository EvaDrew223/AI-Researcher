        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge gaps, leading to overconfident responses in areas of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches focus on improving confidence calibration within the model's existing knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "Humans naturally seek additional information when uncertain. Emulating this behavior could lead to more robust uncertainty quantification and improved responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (UDIS), a prompting strategy that encourages the model to actively identify and address its own uncertainties. The prompt guides the model through the following steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score. 2) Identify specific areas of uncertainty within the response. 3) Formulate targeted questions to address these uncertainties. 4) Simulate retrieving answers to these questions (from an imaginary knowledge source). 5) Incorporate the new 'information' to revise the original response and confidence score. 6) Repeat steps 2-5 for a set number of iterations or until confidence reaches a threshold. This process mimics human information-seeking behavior and provides insight into the model's uncertainty reasoning.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare UDIS with standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., multi-hop question answering, scientific reasoning). Evaluate the quality of generated questions, the impact of simulated information retrieval on response accuracy, and the calibration of final confidence scores."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (UDIS): Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge gaps, leading to overconfident responses in areas of uncertainty. This can result in the propagation of misinformation and reduced trust in AI systems. Current approaches primarily focus on improving confidence calibration within the model's existing knowledge, but fail to address the fundamental issue of knowledge gaps.",
        "Motivation": "Humans naturally seek additional information when uncertain, a behavior that could lead to more robust uncertainty quantification and improved responses if emulated by LLMs. Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, do not actively address knowledge gaps. Our proposed method, Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (UDIS), aims to mimic human information-seeking behavior, potentially leading to better-calibrated and more accurate responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (UDIS), a prompting strategy that encourages the model to actively identify and address its own uncertainties. The process involves the following steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score. 2) Identify specific areas of uncertainty within the response. 3) Formulate targeted questions to address these uncertainties. 4) Simulate retrieving answers to these questions (from an imaginary knowledge source). 5) Incorporate the new 'information' to revise the original response and confidence score. 6) Repeat steps 2-5 for a set number of iterations or until confidence reaches a threshold.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of domains and difficulty levels, allowing us to test UDIS across various scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and 3) Few-shot prompting with confidence scores. For each method, we'll use a consistent prompt template across all questions in the datasets.",
            "Step 3: UDIS Implementation": "Implement the UDIS method with the following sub-steps for each question: a) Initial response generation, b) Uncertainty identification, c) Question formulation, d) Simulated information retrieval, e) Response revision. We'll use few-shot examples to guide the model through each step.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and UDIS), we will: 1) Generate responses and confidence scores for all questions. 2) For UDIS, allow up to 3 iterations of the information-seeking process. 3) Record all intermediate steps (e.g., identified uncertainties, formulated questions) for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the methods using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration error: difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. 3) ECE (Expected Calibration Error): weighted average of the calibration error across confidence buckets. 4) Question quality: human evaluation of the relevance and specificity of questions generated by UDIS. 5) Response improvement: comparison of initial and final responses in UDIS.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of UDIS performance against baselines across different datasets and question types. 2) Analysis of how the number of UDIS iterations affects performance. 3) Examination of cases where UDIS significantly improves or fails to improve over baselines. 4) Investigation of the relationship between generated questions and response improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDIS; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide an initial answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDIS; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDIS; Step 2: Uncertainty Identification)": "Given your previous answer, identify any specific areas of uncertainty or aspects that could benefit from additional information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDIS; Step 2: Uncertainty Identification)": "While I'm quite confident that Paris is the capital of France, I could benefit from additional information on: 1) When Paris became the capital of France. 2) If there are any other cities that have historically been the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDIS; Step 3: Question Formulation)": "Based on the identified uncertainties, formulate specific questions to address these gaps in knowledge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDIS; Step 3: Question Formulation)": "1. When did Paris become the official capital of France?\n2. Have any other cities served as the capital of France throughout its history?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDIS; Step 4: Simulated Information Retrieval)": "Simulate retrieving answers to the formulated questions from a reliable source.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDIS; Step 4: Simulated Information Retrieval)": "1. Paris became the official capital of France in 987 when Hugh Capet, the first King of France, made it his seat of power.\n2. Yes, other cities have served as the capital of France. Notably, during World War II, Vichy was the capital of Nazi-occupied France from 1940 to 1944.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDIS; Step 5: Response Revision)": "Given the additional information, revise your original response and provide an updated confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDIS; Step 5: Response Revision)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. It has been the official capital since 987 when Hugh Capet made it his seat of power. While other cities, such as Vichy during World War II, have briefly served as capitals, Paris has been the primary capital of France for over a millennium. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Explanation": "The UDIS method allows the model to identify areas of uncertainty, seek additional information, and incorporate it into a more comprehensive and confident response. This process mimics human information-seeking behavior and leads to a more nuanced and accurate answer compared to standard prompting."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UDIS does not significantly improve performance over baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of generated questions to identify if the model is struggling to pinpoint true areas of uncertainty. 2) Analyzing the simulated information retrieval step to see if it's providing accurate and useful information. 3) Investigating whether the model is effectively incorporating new information into its revised responses. Based on these analyses, we could modify UDIS by: a) Providing more targeted prompts for uncertainty identification and question generation. b) Implementing a more structured format for the simulated information retrieval, possibly including citations or confidence levels for retrieved information. c) Exploring different prompting strategies for the response revision step to encourage more effective integration of new information. Additionally, we could pivot the project to focus on analyzing the patterns of uncertainty in LLMs across different types of questions and knowledge domains, which could provide valuable insights for future work on improving LLM calibration and knowledge seeking behaviors."
