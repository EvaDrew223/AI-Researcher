        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often fail to capture the hierarchical nature of complex reasoning tasks, leading to inaccurate confidence assessments.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like ensemble methods or dropout-based uncertainty estimation treat the problem in a flat manner, ignoring the hierarchical structure of reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often break down complex problems into subtasks and assess their confidence at each step, propagating uncertainty through the reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Propagation via Prompt Trees (UPPT), a novel prompting method that mimics human hierarchical reasoning. UPPT decomposes a task into a tree of subtasks, each represented by a node. At each node, we prompt the LLM to: (1) Solve the subtask, (2) Estimate its confidence in the solution, and (3) Identify child subtasks if needed. Uncertainty is propagated up the tree using a custom aggregation function that combines confidences from child nodes. The root node's final confidence represents the overall task uncertainty. We use carefully crafted prompts at each node to guide the LLM in this process, ensuring consistent uncertainty estimation across the tree.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UPPT against baselines like direct prompting and ensemble methods on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and GSM8K. We'll measure performance using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score, as well as task-specific accuracy measures."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Propagation via Prompt Trees: Hierarchical Confidence Estimation for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the hierarchical nature of complex reasoning tasks, leading to inaccurate confidence assessments. This is particularly problematic in multi-step reasoning tasks where errors can compound and propagate through the reasoning chain.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like ensemble methods or dropout-based uncertainty estimation treat the problem in a flat manner, ignoring the hierarchical structure of reasoning. These methods often struggle to accurately represent uncertainty in complex, multi-step tasks. In contrast, human experts often break down complex problems into subtasks and assess their confidence at each step, propagating uncertainty through the reasoning process. By mimicking this hierarchical approach, we aim to develop a more nuanced and accurate method for uncertainty estimation in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Propagation via Prompt Trees (UPPT), a novel prompting method that mimics human hierarchical reasoning. UPPT decomposes a task into a tree of subtasks, each represented by a node.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the MATH dataset and GSM8K dataset for our experiments. These datasets contain complex mathematical reasoning problems that are suitable for testing hierarchical uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation, and (3) Ensemble method using multiple runs of CoT prompting.",
            "Step 3: UPPT Implementation": "Implement the UPPT method with the following sub-steps: (a) Task decomposition prompt design, (b) Subtask solving and confidence estimation prompt design, (c) Child subtask identification prompt design, (d) Uncertainty propagation function implementation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments. We will also test with GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on both datasets using all methods (baselines and UPPT). For each problem, we will record the final answer, the confidence estimation, and the intermediate steps (for CoT and UPPT).",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Task-specific accuracy, (2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (3) Brier Score, and (4) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis of the results, including: (a) Comparison of UPPT vs baselines, (b) Analysis of uncertainty propagation in UPPT, (c) Correlation between task complexity and uncertainty estimation accuracy, (d) Qualitative analysis of task decomposition and reasoning paths."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is its volume in cubic centimeters? Provide your answer and your confidence in it on a scale of 0 to 1.",
                "Output": "To find the volume of a rectangular prism, we multiply its length, width, and height.\n\nVolume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\nVolume = 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 4 cm\nVolume = 60 cm\u00b3\n\nTherefore, the volume of the rectangular prism is 60 cubic centimeters.\n\nConfidence: 0.95\n\nI'm highly confident in this answer because the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is straightforward, and the calculation involves simple multiplication of whole numbers."
            },
            "UPPT Example": {
                "Input": "Q: A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is its volume in cubic centimeters? Decompose this problem into subtasks, solve each subtask, and provide your confidence for each step on a scale of 0 to 1.",
                "Output": "Task Decomposition:\n1. Recall the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism\n2. Identify the given dimensions\n3. Calculate the volume\n\nSubtask 1: Recall the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism\nFormula: Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\nConfidence: 1.0\n\nSubtask 2: Identify the given dimensions\nLength = 5 cm\nWidth = 3 cm\nHeight = 4 cm\nConfidence: 1.0\n\nSubtask 3: Calculate the volume\nVolume = 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 4 cm = 60 cm\u00b3\nConfidence: 0.99\n\nFinal Answer: The volume of the rectangular prism is 60 cubic centimeters.\n\nOverall Confidence: 0.99\n\nExplanation of overall confidence:\nThe overall confidence is calculated by taking the minimum confidence of all subtasks, as the final result depends on the accuracy of each step. In this case, the lowest confidence is 0.99 for the calculation step, so that becomes our overall confidence."
            },
            "Explanation": "The UPPT method provides a more detailed breakdown of the problem-solving process, allowing for more nuanced confidence estimation at each step. This hierarchical approach enables the model to identify potential sources of uncertainty more precisely, leading to a more accurate overall confidence assessment. In contrast, the baseline method provides a single confidence score for the entire problem, which may not capture the nuances of the reasoning process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UPPT method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: (1) Examining the task decompositions to ensure they are logical and helpful for solving the problems. (2) Analyzing the confidence estimations at each node to identify any patterns or biases. (3) Investigating the uncertainty propagation function to see if it's effectively combining confidences from child nodes. Based on these analyses, we might modify the UPPT method, such as experimenting with different prompt designs for task decomposition or alternative uncertainty propagation functions. If these modifications don't yield improvements, we could pivot the project to focus on analyzing why hierarchical uncertainty estimation is challenging for LLMs, potentially uncovering insights about their reasoning processes and limitations in handling structured uncertainty."
