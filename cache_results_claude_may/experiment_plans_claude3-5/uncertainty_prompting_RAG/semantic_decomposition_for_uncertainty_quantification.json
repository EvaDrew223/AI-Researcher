    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often provide a single confidence score for complex queries, failing to capture nuanced uncertainties in different aspects of the response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches treat uncertainty as a scalar value, overlooking the multifaceted nature of complex language tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from how humans break down complex problems, we propose a method to decompose queries into semantic components and estimate uncertainty for each part separately.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Quantification: 1) Given a complex query, prompt the model to break it down into atomic semantic components (e.g., for a historical analysis, separate facts, causal relationships, and interpretations). 2) For each component, generate multiple alternative responses using techniques like nucleus sampling. 3) Prompt the model to estimate its confidence for each alternative of each component. 4) Aggregate component-level uncertainties into a structured uncertainty representation for the overall query. 5) Use this structured representation to generate a final response with nuanced uncertainty expressions (e.g., 'I'm certain about X, fairly confident about Y, but uncertain regarding Z').",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on complex reasoning tasks like multi-hop question answering and analytical writing. Compare against baseline methods in terms of uncertainty calibration, informativeness of uncertainty representation, and human-judged appropriateness of expressed uncertainty."

        "Title": "Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Language models often provide a single confidence score for complex queries, failing to capture nuanced uncertainties in different aspects of the response. This oversimplification can lead to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones, potentially misleading users and limiting the model's practical utility.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically treat uncertainty as a scalar value, overlooking the multifaceted nature of complex language tasks. Our approach draws inspiration from how humans break down complex problems, aiming to provide a more granular and interpretable uncertainty representation. By decomposing queries into semantic components and estimating uncertainty for each part separately, we can better capture the nuanced confidence levels across different aspects of a response, potentially improving the overall calibration and interpretability of language model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Quantification (SDUQ), a multi-step approach: 1) Given a complex query, prompt the model to break it down into atomic semantic components. 2) For each component, generate multiple alternative responses using nucleus sampling. 3) Prompt the model to estimate its confidence for each alternative of each component. 4) Aggregate component-level uncertainties into a structured uncertainty representation for the overall query. 5) Use this structured representation to generate a final response with nuanced uncertainty expressions.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of complex reasoning tasks that benefit from nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baselines: 1) Direct prompting with a single confidence score, 2) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation, and 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using different model checkpoints or temperatures.",
            "Step 3: SDUQ Implementation": "Implement the SDUQ method with the following sub-steps: a) Semantic decomposition prompting, b) Alternative generation, c) Component-wise confidence estimation, d) Uncertainty aggregation, and e) Final response generation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error to measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy, 2) Brier score to assess probabilistic predictions, 3) Human evaluation of uncertainty expression appropriateness, and 4) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy for QA tasks).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods, b) Run SDUQ method, c) Collect predictions and uncertainty estimates, d) Compute evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform comparative analysis between SDUQ and baselines, focusing on: a) Overall performance improvements, b) Calibration improvements, c) Qualitative analysis of uncertainty expressions, and d) Performance breakdown by query complexity and domain."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France, and when was the Eiffel Tower built?",
                "Output": "The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889. (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score for the entire response, which may not accurately reflect the model's varying levels of certainty about different parts of the answer."
            },
            "SDUQ Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France, and when was the Eiffel Tower built?",
                "Step 1 - Decomposition": "1. What is the capital of France?\n2. When was the Eiffel Tower built?",
                "Step 2 - Alternatives": "1a. Paris (0.99), Lyon (0.01)\n2a. 1889 (0.85), 1890 (0.10), 1900 (0.05)",
                "Step 3 - Confidence Estimation": "1. Capital of France: 0.99\n2. Eiffel Tower construction date: 0.85",
                "Step 4 - Aggregation": "Overall confidence: 0.92",
                "Step 5 - Final Response": "The capital of France is Paris (I'm very certain about this), and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 (I'm fairly confident about this date, but there's a small chance it could be off by a year or two).",
                "Explanation": "SDUQ provides a more nuanced uncertainty representation, distinguishing between the high confidence in the capital and the slightly lower confidence in the construction date."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SDUQ doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why decomposition-based uncertainty quantification might be challenging for LLMs. We'll conduct ablation studies on each component of SDUQ to identify which steps are most crucial or problematic. We can also investigate how the performance varies across different types of queries or domains, potentially uncovering insights about when decomposition is most beneficial. Additionally, we might explore alternative decomposition strategies, such as hierarchical decomposition or using retrieval to guide the decomposition process. Finally, we could analyze the relationship between query complexity and the effectiveness of semantic decomposition, which could provide valuable insights for future research in this area."
