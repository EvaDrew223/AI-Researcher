    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often produce overconfident initial estimates that don't reflect true uncertainty, especially for complex queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple averaging of multiple samples.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often refine their confidence through iterative consideration and self-questioning. We aim to mimic this process algorithmically.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Confidence Refinement (RCR), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Initial response and confidence estimation. 2) Generate targeted follow-up questions to probe potential weaknesses or ambiguities in the initial response. 3) Answer these questions and update the confidence estimate based on the new information. 4) Repeat steps 2-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes. 5) Aggregate the confidence estimates from each iteration using a weighted average, with later iterations given higher weight. 6) Output the final refined answer and confidence score.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate RCR against single-pass confidence estimation and other iterative methods on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., multi-hop question answering, ethical dilemmas). Measure performance in terms of calibration, correlation with task difficulty, and ability to identify edge cases."

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Refinement: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce overconfident initial estimates that don't reflect true uncertainty, especially for complex queries. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, particularly in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple averaging of multiple samples, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks. Humans often refine their confidence through iterative consideration and self-questioning. We aim to mimic this process algorithmically to achieve more accurate uncertainty quantification in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Confidence Refinement (RCR), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Initial response and confidence estimation. 2) Generate targeted follow-up questions to probe potential weaknesses or ambiguities in the initial response. 3) Answer these questions and update the confidence estimate based on the new information. 4) Repeat steps 2-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes. 5) Aggregate the confidence estimates from each iteration using a weighted average, with later iterations given higher weight. 6) Output the final refined answer and confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of complex reasoning tasks where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Single-pass confidence estimation: directly prompt the model to generate an answer and confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: generate multiple samples and average their confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: RCR Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Confidence Refinement method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation with confidence score. b) Follow-up question generation. c) Question answering and confidence update. d) Iteration and aggregation.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of RCR. For example: Initial prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'. Follow-up question generation prompt: 'Generate 3 follow-up questions that could help verify or challenge your initial answer: [INITIAL_ANSWER]'. Confidence update prompt: 'Based on the new information from answering the follow-up questions, update your confidence score: [FOLLOW_UP_QA]'.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 6: Hyperparameter Tuning": "Experiment with different numbers of iterations (e.g., 1, 3, 5) and weighting schemes for confidence aggregation (e.g., linear, exponential) to find the optimal configuration.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) AUC-ROC: evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of RCR against baselines across different task types. 2) Analysis of how confidence scores change over iterations. 3) Examination of generated follow-up questions and their impact on final confidence scores."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95"
            },
            "RCR Example": {
                "Initial Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Initial Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
                "Follow-up Questions": "1. When did Paris become the capital of France? 2. Are there any other cities that have been the capital of France in history? 3. What is the population of Paris?",
                "Follow-up Answers": "1. Paris became the capital of France in 987 when Hugh Capet made it his seat of power. 2. Yes, other cities have been capitals of France, including Versailles during parts of the 17th and 18th centuries. 3. The population of Paris proper is about 2.2 million, while the greater Paris metropolitan area has over 12 million inhabitants.",
                "Updated Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. However, it's worth noting that other cities, such as Versailles, have also served as capitals at different points in French history. Confidence score: 90"
            },
            "Explanation": "In the baseline example, the model provides a high confidence score without further consideration. In the RCR example, the follow-up questions lead to a more nuanced answer and a slightly lower, potentially more accurate confidence score. This demonstrates how RCR can lead to more calibrated uncertainty estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RCR method doesn't significantly improve calibration or uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the patterns in generated follow-up questions to understand what types of questions are most effective at refining confidence estimates. This could lead to insights on how LLMs reason about their own knowledge and uncertainties. Second, we could investigate how the performance of RCR varies across different types of tasks (e.g., factual recall vs. complex reasoning) and different levels of initial confidence. This analysis could reveal in which scenarios iterative refinement is most beneficial. Finally, we could explore combining RCR with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies."
