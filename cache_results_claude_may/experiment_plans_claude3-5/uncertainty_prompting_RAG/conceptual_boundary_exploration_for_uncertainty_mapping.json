    "idea_name": "Conceptual Boundary Exploration for Uncertainty Mapping",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately represent their uncertainty, especially at the boundaries of their knowledge domains where confidence should decrease.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on confidence estimation within the model's perceived area of expertise, neglecting the exploration of knowledge boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically probing the conceptual boundaries of an LLM's knowledge, we can create a more comprehensive map of its uncertainty, revealing areas where confidence should taper off.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Boundary Exploration (CBE), a prompting strategy that maps uncertainty by progressively moving from core concepts to peripheral ones. CBE involves: 1) Identifying central concepts in the model's response, 2) Generating a series of prompts that gradually move away from these core concepts towards related but increasingly distant ideas, 3) Eliciting confidence estimates and explanations at each step, 4) Constructing an uncertainty map based on how confidence changes as we move away from central concepts. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to recognize and articulate the limits of its knowledge, creating a nuanced representation of uncertainty across conceptual space.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CBE against traditional confidence estimation methods on tasks requiring broad knowledge, such as interdisciplinary problem-solving or open-ended explanations. Assess performance using metrics like uncertainty gradient accuracy, detection of knowledge boundaries, and correlation with human judgments of concept relatedness and model expertise."

        "Title": "Conceptual Boundary Exploration: Mapping Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately represent their uncertainty, especially at the boundaries of their knowledge domains where confidence should decrease. This misrepresentation can lead to overconfident responses in areas where the model's knowledge is limited, potentially resulting in the spread of misinformation or poor decision-making based on unreliable outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically focus on assessing uncertainty within the model's perceived area of expertise, neglecting the exploration of knowledge boundaries. By systematically probing the conceptual boundaries of an LLM's knowledge, we can create a more comprehensive map of its uncertainty, revealing areas where confidence should taper off. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where experts are often more aware of the limits of their knowledge than novices. Our method aims to leverage the LLM's ability to reason about its own knowledge, encouraging it to recognize and articulate the limits of its understanding across different domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Boundary Exploration (CBE), a prompting strategy that maps uncertainty by progressively moving from core concepts to peripheral ones. CBE involves four main steps: 1) Identifying central concepts in the model's initial response to a query, 2) Generating a series of prompts that gradually move away from these core concepts towards related but increasingly distant ideas, 3) Eliciting confidence estimates and explanations at each step, and 4) Constructing an uncertainty map based on how confidence changes as we move away from central concepts. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to recognize and articulate the limits of its knowledge, creating a nuanced representation of uncertainty across conceptual space.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a diverse set of initial queries across multiple domains (e.g., science, history, current events, technology). Ensure that these queries cover both areas where LLMs are known to perform well and areas where they might struggle.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Estimation": "Implement traditional confidence estimation methods as baselines. This includes: a) Direct confidence prompting (e.g., 'How confident are you about this answer on a scale of 0-100?'), b) Probability calibration using temperature scaling, c) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using multiple model runs.",
            "Step 3: Implement CBE": "For each initial query: a) Generate an initial response from the LLM, b) Identify key concepts in the response using keyword extraction or named entity recognition, c) Create a series of follow-up prompts that gradually move away from these core concepts (e.g., 'How does [concept] relate to [increasingly distant topic]?'), d) For each follow-up prompt, elicit a response and a confidence estimate from the LLM.",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Mapping": "Develop an algorithm to create an uncertainty map based on the confidence estimates across the conceptual space explored in Step 3. This could involve techniques like graph-based representation of concepts and their relationships, with confidence scores as edge weights.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Define metrics to assess the performance of CBE compared to baselines: a) Uncertainty gradient accuracy: measure how well the confidence decreases as we move away from core concepts, b) Detection of knowledge boundaries: ability to identify points where confidence drops significantly, c) Correlation with human judgments: compare LLM uncertainty maps with human expert assessments of concept relatedness and model expertise.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the quality and interpretability of the uncertainty maps produced by CBE. This will involve presenting experts with the maps and asking them to rate their accuracy and usefulness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare the performance of CBE against baseline methods across different domains and types of queries. Analyze patterns in how uncertainty is represented across conceptual spaces and identify any consistent strengths or weaknesses of the approach."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France, and how confident are you in your answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE Step 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE Step 1)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE Step 2)": "Identify the key concepts in the previous answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE Step 2)": "Key concepts: 1. Capital, 2. France, 3. Paris",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE Step 3)": "How does Paris relate to the European Union's political structure? Rate your confidence in your answer from 0-100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE Step 3)": "Paris, as the capital of France, plays a significant role in the European Union's political structure. France is one of the founding members and key players in the EU, and Paris often hosts important EU meetings and events. However, it's not the capital of the EU (Brussels is often considered the de facto capital). Confidence: 85/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE Step 4)": "How does Paris influence the political dynamics of North African countries? Rate your confidence in your answer from 0-100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE Step 4)": "Paris, as the capital of France, has some influence on North African countries due to historical colonial ties and current diplomatic relations. France maintains political and economic connections with countries like Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. However, the specific dynamics and extent of influence can vary greatly and have changed over time. Confidence: 60/100",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how CBE progressively moves from a core concept (Paris as the capital of France) to increasingly distant topics (EU politics, North African relations). The model's confidence decreases as we move further from its area of high certainty, providing a more nuanced representation of its knowledge boundaries compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CBE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in representing uncertainty, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why CBE fails, which could provide valuable insights into LLM knowledge representation and confidence estimation. 2) Explore combining CBE with other techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration approaches, to create a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches. 3) Investigate how the uncertainty maps produced by CBE could be used to improve other aspects of LLM performance, such as guiding retrieval-augmented generation or identifying areas where model fine-tuning is needed. 4) Expand the project to focus on how different types of queries and domains affect uncertainty representation, potentially uncovering patterns that could inform future LLM development and training strategies."
