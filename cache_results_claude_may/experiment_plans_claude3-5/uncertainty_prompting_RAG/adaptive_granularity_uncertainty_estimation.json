    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide uniform confidence estimates regardless of the complexity or granularity of the query, leading to either over-confidence on difficult questions or under-confidence on simple ones.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use fixed prompting strategies or post-hoc calibration methods.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts adjust their confidence estimates based on the perceived difficulty and specificity of questions. We can mimic this behavior in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adaptive Granularity Prompting (AGP), which dynamically adjusts the granularity of the confidence estimation process based on the complexity of the query. AGP first prompts the LLM to assess the difficulty and specificity of the question. Based on this assessment, it then applies different prompting strategies: for simple questions, it uses direct confidence elicitation; for moderate questions, it employs a step-by-step reasoning approach with confidence checks at each step; and for complex questions, it utilizes a multi-perspective analysis with competing hypotheses. The final confidence estimate is a weighted combination of these adaptive strategies.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate AGP against fixed prompting strategies on a curated dataset with varying question difficulties. Measure performance using calibration metrics and correlate with human-judged question complexity."

        "Title": "Adaptive Granularity Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide uniform confidence estimates regardless of the complexity or granularity of the query, leading to either over-confidence on difficult questions or under-confidence on simple ones. This inconsistency in confidence estimation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically use fixed prompting strategies or post-hoc calibration methods, which fail to adapt to the varying complexity of different queries. Human experts, on the other hand, adjust their confidence estimates based on the perceived difficulty and specificity of questions. By mimicking this behavior in LLMs, we can potentially improve their uncertainty quantification and calibration across a wide range of query complexities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adaptive Granularity Prompting (AGP), which dynamically adjusts the granularity of the confidence estimation process based on the complexity of the query. AGP consists of three main steps: 1) Complexity Assessment: Prompt the LLM to assess the difficulty and specificity of the question. 2) Strategy Selection: Based on the complexity assessment, apply different prompting strategies: direct confidence elicitation for simple questions, step-by-step reasoning with confidence checks for moderate questions, and multi-perspective analysis with competing hypotheses for complex questions. 3) Confidence Aggregation: Combine the outputs from these adaptive strategies to produce a final confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse dataset of questions with varying difficulties from existing benchmarks such as TriviaQA, SQuAD, and HotpotQA. Annotate each question with a human-judged complexity score (1-5 scale).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the LLM to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Fixed step-by-step reasoning: Use a chain-of-thought prompt with a fixed number of steps, followed by a confidence estimation.",
            "Step 3: AGP Implementation": "Implement the AGP method with the following sub-steps: a) Complexity Assessment: Prompt the LLM with 'On a scale of 1-5, how complex is this question? Provide a brief explanation.' b) Strategy Selection: Based on the complexity score, apply one of three strategies: - Score 1-2: Direct confidence elicitation - Score 3-4: Step-by-step reasoning with confidence checks - Score 5: Multi-perspective analysis with competing hypotheses c) Confidence Aggregation: For multi-step strategies, aggregate confidence scores using a weighted average based on the step importance.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of AGP against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare model confidence with actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Correlation with human-judged complexity: Assess how well the model's confidence aligns with question difficulty.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Performance breakdown by question complexity. 2) Qualitative analysis of AGP's adaptive behavior. 3) Error analysis to identify patterns in miscalibrated predictions."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AGP; Step 1: Complexity Assessment)": "Q: What is the capital of France? On a scale of 1-5, how complex is this question? Provide a brief explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AGP; Step 1: Complexity Assessment)": "Complexity score: 1. Explanation: This is a straightforward factual question about a well-known capital city. It requires only basic general knowledge and doesn't involve any complex reasoning or multiple steps.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AGP; Step 2: Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, explaining your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AGP; Step 2: Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99. Reasoning: This is a widely known fact that is taught in basic geography and is consistently true. Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, and this information is rarely, if ever, subject to change or confusion.",
            "Explanation": "For this simple question, AGP correctly assesses it as low complexity and uses direct confidence elicitation. The output provides a high confidence score with a clear explanation, which is more informative than the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If AGP doesn't show significant improvements over the baselines, we can explore several alternative directions: 1) Analyze the correlation between the complexity assessment and the actual question difficulty to identify potential mismatches. This could lead to refining the complexity assessment prompt or developing a more sophisticated complexity scoring system. 2) Investigate the effectiveness of each individual strategy (direct elicitation, step-by-step reasoning, and multi-perspective analysis) across different question types. This could inform a more nuanced strategy selection process or the development of hybrid approaches. 3) Explore the impact of different aggregation methods for multi-step strategies, such as using attention mechanisms or learned weights. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where AGP performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the adaptive approach. This could lead to the development of targeted prompting techniques for specific types of questions or reasoning patterns. 5) If the overall approach doesn't yield improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper comparing different prompting strategies for uncertainty quantification across various question types and complexities, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of current LLM capabilities in this domain."
