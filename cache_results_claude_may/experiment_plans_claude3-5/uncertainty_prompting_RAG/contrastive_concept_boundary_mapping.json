        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately quantify uncertainty for queries that lie near conceptual boundaries or in areas of overlapping concepts, leading to miscalibrated confidence in edge cases.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods typically don't explicitly consider conceptual boundaries or overlaps in the model's knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "By probing the boundaries and overlaps of related concepts, we can better understand the model's areas of confusion and uncertainty, leading to more accurate confidence calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Concept Boundary Mapping, a prompting technique that explores conceptual boundaries. Given a query, the method first prompts the model to identify related concepts. It then generates a series of prompts that explore the boundaries between these concepts, asking the model to differentiate between them and identify areas of overlap. For example, 'What are the key differences between concept A and concept B?' and 'In what scenarios might concepts A and B be confused?' The model's ability to clearly delineate these boundaries is used to calibrate its confidence. A final meta-prompt analyzes the boundary clarity and overlap areas to produce a calibrated uncertainty estimate, with more ambiguous boundaries indicating higher uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on datasets with nuanced categorical distinctions, such as fine-grained entity typing tasks or ambiguous classification problems. Compare against standard prompting and existing calibration methods using metrics like Expected Calibration Error and Brier Score. Analyze the correlation between boundary clarity and actual error rates."

        "Title": "Contrastive Concept Boundary Mapping: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately quantify uncertainty for queries that lie near conceptual boundaries or in areas of overlapping concepts, leading to miscalibrated confidence in edge cases. This problem is particularly pronounced in tasks requiring fine-grained distinctions or nuanced understanding of related concepts.",
        "Motivation": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods typically don't explicitly consider conceptual boundaries or overlaps in the model's knowledge. By probing the boundaries and overlaps of related concepts, we can better understand the model's areas of confusion and uncertainty, leading to more accurate confidence calibration. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where understanding the boundaries between concepts often leads to a more nuanced grasp of the concepts themselves and a better awareness of one's own knowledge limitations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Concept Boundary Mapping (CCBM), a prompting technique that explores conceptual boundaries to calibrate LLM confidence. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Concept Identification: Given a query, prompt the model to identify related concepts. 2) Boundary Exploration: Generate a series of prompts that explore the boundaries between these concepts, asking the model to differentiate between them and identify areas of overlap. 3) Boundary Clarity Analysis: Analyze the model's ability to delineate these boundaries clearly. 4) Uncertainty Calibration: Use a meta-prompt to analyze the boundary clarity and overlap areas to produce a calibrated uncertainty estimate, with more ambiguous boundaries indicating higher uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) FewRel dataset for fine-grained relation classification, 2) FIGER dataset for fine-grained entity typing, and 3) a subset of the GLUE diagnostic dataset focusing on semantic categories. These datasets are chosen because they involve nuanced categorical distinctions where concept boundaries are crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly ask the model to classify and provide a confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CCBM Implementation": "Implement the four steps of CCBM: a) Concept Identification: Prompt: 'Given the query [X], identify the top 3 most relevant concepts for classification.' b) Boundary Exploration: For each pair of concepts, generate prompts like 'What are the key differences between concept A and concept B?' and 'In what scenarios might concepts A and B be confused?' c) Boundary Clarity Analysis: Analyze the coherence and specificity of the boundary descriptions. d) Uncertainty Calibration: Use a meta-prompt like 'Based on the boundary descriptions and overlap scenarios, estimate the model's uncertainty in classifying [X] on a scale of 0-100.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the methods using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Brier Score, 3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for the uncertainty estimates. We'll also analyze the correlation between boundary clarity scores and actual error rates.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing each step of CCBM to understand the contribution of each component. Also, vary the number of concepts considered (e.g., top 2, top 5) to analyze the trade-off between performance and computational cost.",
            "Step 7: Error Analysis": "Perform a qualitative analysis of cases where CCBM significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. Examine the generated concept boundaries and overlap scenarios to gain insights into the model's reasoning process.",
            "Step 8: Robustness Check": "Test the robustness of CCBM by introducing noise or adversarial examples to the input queries and analyzing how it affects the uncertainty estimates compared to baselines."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Classify the relation between 'Apple' and 'iPhone' in the sentence: 'Apple unveiled its latest iPhone model at the annual conference.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Relation: Product-Producer\nConfidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Concept Identification)": "Given the query to classify the relation between 'Apple' and 'iPhone' in the sentence: 'Apple unveiled its latest iPhone model at the annual conference.', identify the top 3 most relevant concepts for classification.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Concept Identification)": "1. Product-Producer\n2. Company-Product\n3. Creator-Creation",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Boundary Exploration)": "What are the key differences between the 'Product-Producer' and 'Company-Product' relations? In what scenarios might these relations be confused?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Boundary Exploration)": "Key differences:\n1. 'Product-Producer' emphasizes the act of creation or manufacturing, while 'Company-Product' focuses on ownership or association.\n2. 'Product-Producer' can apply to individual inventors or small-scale producers, whereas 'Company-Product' typically involves larger corporate entities.\n3. 'Product-Producer' implies a more direct involvement in the product's development.\n\nPotential confusion scenarios:\n1. When a company both produces and sells a product, like Apple with iPhones.\n2. In cases of contract manufacturing, where one company produces for another.\n3. When discussing product lines rather than specific products.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Uncertainty Calibration)": "Based on the boundary descriptions and overlap scenarios for 'Product-Producer', 'Company-Product', and 'Creator-Creation' relations, estimate the model's uncertainty in classifying the relation between 'Apple' and 'iPhone' in the sentence: 'Apple unveiled its latest iPhone model at the annual conference.' on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Uncertainty Calibration)": "Uncertainty estimate: 15\n\nExplanation: The uncertainty is relatively low because:\n1. The sentence clearly indicates a company (Apple) introducing a product (iPhone).\n2. The verb 'unveiled' strongly suggests a Product-Producer or Company-Product relation.\n3. While there's some overlap between Product-Producer and Company-Product, the corporate nature of Apple makes Company-Product slightly more fitting.\n4. The Creator-Creation relation is less relevant here, reducing potential confusion.\n\nHowever, a small degree of uncertainty remains due to the potential overlap between Product-Producer and Company-Product in this context.",
            "Explanation": "CCBM provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by explicitly considering the boundaries between related concepts. The baseline method might give a high confidence score without considering the potential confusion between similar relations. CCBM, on the other hand, acknowledges the overlap between 'Product-Producer' and 'Company-Product' relations, leading to a more calibrated uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCBM doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on why explicit concept boundary exploration doesn't improve uncertainty quantification as expected. We could investigate: 1) Whether the concept boundaries generated by LLMs are actually meaningful and consistent across different queries. 2) How the quality of concept boundary descriptions correlates with model performance on the main task. 3) Whether certain types of tasks or concepts benefit more from boundary exploration than others. 4) How the model's responses in the boundary exploration phase relate to its actual decision-making process in the classification task. This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLMs' understanding of conceptual relationships and the limitations of using LLMs to probe their own knowledge boundaries."
