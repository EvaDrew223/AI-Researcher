        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their confidence across different levels of abstraction and specificity in knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-level confidence estimation or use simple hierarchical structures.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts navigate complex knowledge structures fluidly, adjusting their confidence as they move between general concepts and specific details. Emulating this process could lead to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique that guides the model through a concept lattice - a structure representing the hierarchical and interconnected nature of knowledge. The process involves: 1) Constructing a domain-specific concept lattice using the model's knowledge. 2) Navigating the lattice via prompts, moving up for abstraction ('What broader category does this belong to?') or down for specificity ('Can you provide a more specific example?'). 3) At each node, prompting for confidence estimation and uncertainty sources. 4) Aggregating confidence scores across multiple paths in the lattice. 5) Using conflicting confidences at different abstraction levels to identify knowledge gaps or inconsistencies.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on diverse datasets covering both broad knowledge (e.g., general trivia) and specialized domains (e.g., scientific literature). Compare against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and hierarchical prompting. Measure calibration, resolution, and the model's ability to identify true knowledge boundaries."

        "Title": "Concept Lattice Navigation: A Novel Prompting Method for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their confidence across different levels of abstraction and specificity in knowledge domains. This leads to unreliable uncertainty estimates, which can be problematic in critical applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on single-level confidence estimation or use simple hierarchical structures, which fail to capture the complex, interconnected nature of knowledge. Human experts navigate complex knowledge structures fluidly, adjusting their confidence as they move between general concepts and specific details. Emulating this process could lead to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification in LLMs. By guiding the model through a concept lattice - a structure representing the hierarchical and interconnected nature of knowledge - we can potentially achieve more accurate and contextually aware confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique that guides the model through a concept lattice for uncertainty quantification. The process involves: 1) Constructing a domain-specific concept lattice using the model's knowledge. 2) Navigating the lattice via prompts, moving up for abstraction ('What broader category does this belong to?') or down for specificity ('Can you provide a more specific example?'). 3) At each node, prompting for confidence estimation and uncertainty sources. 4) Aggregating confidence scores across multiple paths in the lattice. 5) Using conflicting confidences at different abstraction levels to identify knowledge gaps or inconsistencies.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: 1) A subset of the TriviaQA dataset for general knowledge questions. 2) A curated set of scientific questions from the SciQ dataset. These datasets cover both broad knowledge and specialized domains.",
            "Step 2: Concept Lattice Construction": "For each domain (general knowledge and scientific), we will prompt the LLM to generate a concept lattice. The prompt will be: 'Create a hierarchical structure of concepts for [domain], starting from the most general category and moving to more specific subcategories. Include at least 5 levels of hierarchy and multiple branches.'",
            "Step 3: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence level from 0 to 100%: [question]' 2) Hierarchical prompting: 'Consider the following hierarchy: [3-level hierarchy]. Where does [question topic] fit in this hierarchy? Answer the question and provide your confidence level from 0 to 100%: [question]'",
            "Step 4: Concept Lattice Navigation Implementation": "For each question: a) Identify the relevant branch in the concept lattice. b) Start at the most general level and navigate down, using prompts like: 'In the context of [higher-level concept], what is [lower-level concept]? Answer and rate your confidence from 0 to 100%.' c) Move up the lattice with prompts like: 'What broader category does [concept] belong to? How does this affect your confidence in answering questions about [concept]?' d) Repeat this process for at least 3 levels in each direction.",
            "Step 5: Confidence Aggregation": "Implement a weighted average method to aggregate confidence scores across the lattice navigation. Assign higher weights to more specific levels when they show high confidence, and to more general levels when specific levels show low confidence.",
            "Step 6: Model Selection and Execution": "Use GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments. Run the baseline methods and the concept lattice navigation method on both datasets.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the methods using: 1) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence to its actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Confidence resolution: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers through confidence scores.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the concept lattice navigation method against the baselines. Analyze how confidence changes across abstraction levels and identify patterns in knowledge gaps or inconsistencies."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Answer the following question and provide your confidence level from 0 to 100%: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 100%",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Hierarchical Prompting)": "Consider the following hierarchy: Geography > Countries > Cities. Where does the capital of France fit in this hierarchy? Answer the question and provide your confidence level from 0 to 100%: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Hierarchical Prompting)": "The capital of France fits into the 'Cities' category in the given hierarchy. The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Concept Lattice Navigation; Step 1: General Level)": "In the context of European geography, what is France? Answer and rate your confidence from 0 to 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Concept Lattice Navigation; Step 1: General Level)": "France is a country in Western Europe. It is one of the largest countries in Europe and a member of the European Union. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Concept Lattice Navigation; Step 2: More Specific)": "In the context of France as a country, what is its capital city? Answer and rate your confidence from 0 to 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Concept Lattice Navigation; Step 2: More Specific)": "The capital city of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Concept Lattice Navigation; Step 3: Most Specific)": "Regarding Paris as the capital of France, what is the name of its most famous landmark? Answer and rate your confidence from 0 to 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Concept Lattice Navigation; Step 3: Most Specific)": "The most famous landmark in Paris, the capital of France, is the Eiffel Tower. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Concept Lattice Navigation; Step 4: Moving Up)": "What broader category does the Eiffel Tower belong to in terms of Parisian architecture? How does this affect your confidence in answering questions about Paris as the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Concept Lattice Navigation; Step 4: Moving Up)": "The Eiffel Tower belongs to the broader category of iconic Parisian landmarks or monuments. This reinforces my confidence in answering questions about Paris as the capital of France because the Eiffel Tower is universally recognized as a symbol of Paris and, by extension, France. My confidence in Paris being the capital of France remains at 100%.",
            "explanation": "The concept lattice navigation method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the knowledge domain, potentially leading to more accurate confidence estimates. By moving through different levels of abstraction, the model can identify areas of high confidence (e.g., France being a country in Europe, Paris being the capital) and potentially lower confidence (e.g., specific details about Parisian landmarks). This method may help in identifying knowledge gaps or inconsistencies that simpler methods might miss."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed concept lattice navigation method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated concept lattices to understand how the model structures knowledge and where inconsistencies arise. This could provide insights into the model's knowledge representation. 2) Investigate how confidence changes across different abstraction levels and domains. This analysis could reveal patterns in the model's certainty across various knowledge areas. 3) Explore combining the concept lattice navigation with other techniques like calibration or ensemble methods to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 4) Focus on specific cases where the method performs notably better or worse than baselines to understand its strengths and limitations. This could inform the development of more targeted uncertainty quantification methods."
