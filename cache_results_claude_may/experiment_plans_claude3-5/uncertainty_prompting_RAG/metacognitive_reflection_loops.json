        "Problem": "LLMs often provide uncertainty estimates without deeply reflecting on the reasoning process that led to those estimates, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct uncertainty estimation or simple self-reflection prompts.",
        "Motivation": "By encouraging LLMs to engage in iterative metacognitive reflection, we can uncover deeper sources of uncertainty and achieve more reliable and insightful uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Reflection Loops (MRL), a multi-stage prompting technique that guides the LLM through increasingly deep levels of self-reflection. The process begins with a standard response and uncertainty estimate, followed by prompts like: '1. Reflect on your reasoning process for the above answer and uncertainty estimate. 2. Identify potential flaws or biases in your reasoning. 3. Based on this reflection, how might your uncertainty estimate change? 4. What additional information would most significantly impact your uncertainty?' This process is repeated in loops, with each iteration potentially refining the uncertainty estimate and uncovering new sources of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MRL against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods on complex reasoning tasks and open-ended question answering. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration improvement over iterations, depth and quality of self-reflection (as judged by humans), and ability to identify novel sources of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Reflection Loops: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide uncertainty estimates without deeply reflecting on the reasoning process that led to those estimates, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty. This can lead to overconfident or poorly calibrated predictions, which is particularly problematic in high-stakes decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on direct uncertainty estimation or simple self-reflection prompts. These methods often fail to capture the full complexity of the model's reasoning process and may overlook subtle sources of uncertainty. By encouraging LLMs to engage in iterative metacognitive reflection, we can uncover deeper sources of uncertainty and achieve more reliable and insightful uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where individuals reflect on their own thought processes to identify potential biases, knowledge gaps, and areas of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Reflection Loops (MRL), a multi-stage prompting technique that guides the LLM through increasingly deep levels of self-reflection. The process begins with a standard response and uncertainty estimate, followed by a series of prompts designed to encourage deeper reflection:\n1. Reflect on your reasoning process for the above answer and uncertainty estimate.\n2. Identify potential flaws or biases in your reasoning.\n3. Based on this reflection, how might your uncertainty estimate change?\n4. What additional information would most significantly impact your uncertainty?\nThis process is repeated in loops, with each iteration potentially refining the uncertainty estimate and uncovering new sources of uncertainty. The final output includes both the refined answer and a more comprehensive uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that require complex reasoning and are suitable for uncertainty quantification. We will use:\n1. TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to assess LLM's ability to distinguish truth from falsehoods.\n2. BIG-Bench: Specifically, we'll use the 'logical_fallacy_detection' and 'causal_judgment' tasks.\n3. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): Focus on subjects like science, math, and logic.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the question and request an answer with an uncertainty estimate.\n2. Zero-shot CoT: Append 'Let's approach this step by step:' to the question.\n3. Simple self-reflection: After the initial answer, ask 'How certain are you about this answer and why?'",
            "Step 3: MRL Implementation": "Implement the Metacognitive Reflection Loops method:\n1. Initial response: Prompt for an answer and uncertainty estimate.\n2. Reflection loop:\n   a. Prompt for reflection on the reasoning process.\n   b. Ask for identification of potential flaws or biases.\n   c. Request an updated uncertainty estimate based on the reflection.\n   d. Inquire about additional information that could impact uncertainty.\n3. Repeat the reflection loop for a set number of iterations (e.g., 3) or until the uncertainty estimate stabilizes.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. These models provide strong reasoning capabilities and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method:\n1. Process each question through the baseline methods and MRL.\n2. Record the final answers, uncertainty estimates, and intermediate reflections for MRL.\n3. Use a fixed random seed for reproducibility and consistency across methods.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics:\n1. Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers.\n2. Calibration: Use Brier score and calibration plots to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates.\n3. Uncertainty Range: Calculate the average range of uncertainty estimates across iterations in MRL.\n4. Reflection Quality: Use GPT-4 to rate the quality and depth of reflections on a 1-5 scale.\n5. Novel Uncertainty Sources: Count the number of unique uncertainty sources identified in the reflection process.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare the performance of MRL against baselines across all metrics.\n2. Analyze how uncertainty estimates change across reflection loops.\n3. Identify patterns in the types of flaws and biases recognized during reflection.\n4. Examine cases where MRL significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.\n5. Assess the impact of the number of reflection loops on performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the effect of increased carbon dioxide levels on global temperatures? Please provide an answer and an uncertainty estimate.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: Increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere lead to higher global temperatures. This is due to the greenhouse effect, where CO2 traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Uncertainty estimate: 10% (I'm 90% certain about this answer)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRL; Initial Response)": "Q: What is the effect of increased carbon dioxide levels on global temperatures? Please provide an answer and an uncertainty estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRL; Initial Response)": "A: Increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere generally lead to higher global temperatures. This is primarily due to the greenhouse effect, where CO2 traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, preventing it from escaping back into space. Uncertainty estimate: 15% (I'm 85% certain about this answer)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRL; Reflection Loop 1)": "Reflect on your reasoning process for the above answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRL; Reflection Loop 1)": "Reflection: My reasoning is based on the well-established greenhouse effect theory. However, I may be oversimplifying the complex climate system. I didn't consider potential feedback loops, other greenhouse gases, or natural climate variability. My uncertainty estimate might be too low given these complexities.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRL; Reflection Loop 2)": "Based on this reflection, how might your uncertainty estimate change?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRL; Reflection Loop 2)": "Updated uncertainty estimate: 25% (75% certain). The reflection made me realize that the climate system is more complex than I initially considered. While the basic principle of CO2 increasing temperatures is well-supported, the exact magnitude and timescale of the effect involve more uncertainties than I first accounted for.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MRL; Final Response)": "Provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate based on your reflections.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MRL; Final Response)": "Final Answer: Increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere generally lead to higher global temperatures due to the greenhouse effect. However, the exact impact is influenced by various factors including feedback loops, other greenhouse gases, and natural climate variability. While there's strong scientific consensus on the warming effect of CO2, the precise magnitude and timescale of temperature changes can vary. Uncertainty estimate: 25% (75% certain)",
            "Explanation": "The MRL process led to a more nuanced answer and a higher uncertainty estimate. Through reflection, the model recognized additional complexities and potential sources of uncertainty that were not considered in the initial response. This demonstrates how MRL can lead to more comprehensive and cautious uncertainty quantification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MRL method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the reflection process: Examine the content of the reflections to understand what types of uncertainties and biases the model is capable of recognizing. This could provide insights into the model's metacognitive abilities and limitations.\n2. Investigate the impact of prompt engineering: Experiment with different phrasings and structures for the reflection prompts to see if certain formulations lead to more insightful reflections or better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.\n3. Explore the relationship between task difficulty and MRL effectiveness: Analyze whether MRL performs better on certain types of questions or domains. This could lead to insights about when metacognitive approaches are most beneficial.\n4. Combine MRL with other techniques: If MRL alone doesn't provide significant improvements, we could explore combining it with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods.\n5. Focus on qualitative analysis: Even if quantitative improvements are limited, we could conduct a detailed qualitative analysis of the reflection process, potentially yielding insights into how LLMs reason about their own knowledge and uncertainties.\nBy pursuing these alternative directions, we can ensure that the project yields valuable insights into LLM behavior and uncertainty quantification, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
