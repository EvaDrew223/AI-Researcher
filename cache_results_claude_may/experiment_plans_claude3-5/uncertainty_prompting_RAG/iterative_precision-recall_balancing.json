        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to balance precision and recall in their confidence estimates, leading to either overly cautious or overly confident predictions across different types of queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on overall calibration without explicitly addressing the precision-recall tradeoff.",
        "Motivation": "By iteratively adjusting the model's confidence threshold based on precision and recall metrics, we can achieve a more balanced and task-appropriate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Precision-Recall Balancing, a multi-step prompting technique. First, the model is prompted to answer a query and provide an initial confidence score. Then, through a series of follow-up prompts, the model is asked to consider hypothetical precision and recall scenarios based on its initial confidence. For example, 'If your confidence was too high, how might it affect precision?' and 'If your confidence was too low, how might it affect recall?' Based on these reflections, the model iteratively adjusts its confidence score. This process continues for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence. A final meta-prompt synthesizes the trajectory of these adjustments to produce a calibrated uncertainty estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test on a diverse set of tasks including both high-precision requirements (e.g., medical diagnosis from MedQA) and high-recall needs (e.g., toxicity detection from ToxicChat). Compare against baseline methods using precision, recall, F1 score, and calibration metrics. Analyze how the precision-recall balance evolves over iterations for different query types."

        "Title": "Iterative Precision-Recall Balancing: A Novel Prompting Method for Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to balance precision and recall in their confidence estimates, leading to either overly cautious or overly confident predictions across different types of queries. This imbalance can result in unreliable uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for many real-world applications of LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods typically focus on overall calibration without explicitly addressing the precision-recall tradeoff. By iteratively adjusting the model's confidence threshold based on precision and recall metrics, we can achieve a more balanced and task-appropriate uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to refine its confidence estimates, potentially leading to more reliable and well-calibrated outputs across diverse tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Precision-Recall Balancing (IPRB), a multi-step prompting technique. The process involves: 1) Initial response and confidence score generation. 2) Precision-recall reflection through hypothetical scenarios. 3) Iterative confidence adjustment based on these reflections. 4) A final meta-prompt to synthesize the adjustment trajectory and produce a calibrated uncertainty estimate. This method aims to leverage the LLM's ability to reason about its own confidence in relation to precision and recall trade-offs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare datasets that require different precision-recall trade-offs: 1) MedQA for high-precision medical diagnosis tasks. 2) ToxicChat for high-recall toxicity detection. 3) Natural Questions for general knowledge QA.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard prompting methods as baselines: 1) Direct prompting (question only). 2) Few-shot prompting with 3-5 examples. 3) Chain-of-Thought prompting.",
            "Step 3: IPRB Implementation": "Implement the IPRB method with the following steps: 1) Initial response generation with confidence score. 2) Precision-recall reflection prompts. 3) Confidence adjustment based on reflections. 4) Meta-prompt for final calibrated estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: 1) Run baseline methods. 2) Run IPRB method with 3 iterations. 3) Collect model outputs, confidence scores, and execution times.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate results using: 1) Accuracy. 2) Precision. 3) Recall. 4) F1 score. 5) Calibration error. 6) Brier score.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare IPRB performance against baselines. 2) Analyze how precision-recall balance evolves over iterations. 3) Investigate performance differences across task types. 4) Examine the quality and relevance of model-generated reflections."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Question: A 45-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. Physical examination reveals enlarged lymph nodes in her neck. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The most likely diagnosis is lymphoma, with a confidence score of 80%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Question: A 45-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. Physical examination reveals enlarged lymph nodes in her neck. What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "The most likely diagnosis is lymphoma, with a confidence score of 80%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Precision-Recall Reflection)": "Consider your initial diagnosis of lymphoma with 80% confidence. Reflect on the following scenarios: 1) If your confidence was too high, how might it affect precision? 2) If your confidence was too low, how might it affect recall? Provide brief explanations for each scenario.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Precision-Recall Reflection)": "1) If confidence is too high (affecting precision): A high confidence might lead to overlooking other possible diagnoses like infectious mononucleosis or tuberculosis, potentially resulting in false positives for lymphoma. This could lead to unnecessary, invasive diagnostic procedures. 2) If confidence is too low (affecting recall): A low confidence might result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of lymphoma if it is indeed present. This could lead to disease progression and poorer outcomes for the patient.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Confidence Adjustment)": "Based on your reflections, adjust your confidence score if necessary. Explain your reasoning for any changes or for maintaining the same score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Confidence Adjustment)": "I will adjust my confidence score to 75%. While lymphoma remains the most likely diagnosis given the symptoms and physical findings, the reflection highlighted the importance of considering other possibilities. Lowering the confidence slightly acknowledges the need for further diagnostic tests to rule out other conditions, balancing the need for timely lymphoma diagnosis (recall) with avoiding premature conclusions (precision).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Calibrated Estimate)": "Considering your initial diagnosis, reflections, and adjustments, provide a final diagnosis and calibrated confidence score. Explain how this final estimate balances precision and recall concerns.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Calibrated Estimate)": "Final diagnosis: Lymphoma, with a calibrated confidence score of 75%. This estimate balances precision and recall by maintaining a relatively high confidence in the lymphoma diagnosis, reflecting its likelihood given the symptoms, while also acknowledging the need for further testing. This approach ensures timely consideration of lymphoma (high recall) while also leaving room for alternative diagnoses to be explored (improved precision). It encourages prompt further investigation without prematurely concluding a definitive diagnosis.",
            "Explanation": "The IPRB method allows the model to reflect on potential precision-recall trade-offs and adjust its confidence accordingly. This process leads to a more nuanced and balanced final estimate compared to the initial response, potentially improving the reliability of the model's output in critical domains like medical diagnosis."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the IPRB method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the model's reasoning process during the reflection and adjustment steps. This could provide insights into how LLMs consider precision-recall trade-offs and where they might be falling short. 2) Experiment with different prompting strategies for the reflection step, such as more structured formats or domain-specific guidance. 3) Investigate how the effectiveness of IPRB varies across different types of tasks and domains, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply such calibration techniques. 4) Explore combining IPRB with other prompting methods like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to see if there are synergistic effects. 5) If the method shows promise but lacks consistency, we could focus on developing heuristics for when to apply IPRB based on task characteristics or initial confidence levels."
