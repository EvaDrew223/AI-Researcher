    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often rely on single-pass evaluations, failing to capture the nuanced, multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in complex tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like confidence scoring and ensemble methods provide aggregate uncertainty estimates but lack granularity.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how humans break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, we propose a method that decomposes the original prompt into sub-prompts, each addressing a specific aspect of the task.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Prompt Decomposition (PPD), a novel prompting technique that automatically breaks down a given task into a series of sub-tasks. For each sub-task, the LLM generates both an answer and a confidence score. PPD then uses these sub-task confidences to construct a probabilistic graphical model, representing the interdependencies between sub-tasks. This model is used to propagate uncertainty and compute a final, calibrated confidence score for the original task. The decomposition is achieved by prompting the LLM to generate a 'task breakdown' in a structured format, which is then parsed to create the sub-prompts.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PPD against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on complex reasoning tasks from benchmarks like MATH and MMLU. We'll measure calibration using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and compare the granularity of uncertainty information provided."

        "Title": "Probabilistic Prompt Decomposition: Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Task Breakdown",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-pass evaluations, failing to capture the nuanced, multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in complex tasks. This approach limits the granularity and accuracy of uncertainty estimates, potentially leading to overconfident or unreliable model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like confidence scoring and ensemble methods provide aggregate uncertainty estimates but lack granularity. Inspired by how humans break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, we propose a method that decomposes the original prompt into sub-prompts, each addressing a specific aspect of the task. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of model uncertainty and potentially improves the calibration of confidence scores.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from benchmarks like MATH and MMLU. Specifically, we'll focus on the mathematics and science subsets of MMLU and the algebra and geometry sections of MATH. These datasets provide a good mix of complex, multi-step reasoning problems.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods as baselines. These will include: a) Direct prompting with confidence scoring, b) Ensemble methods (using multiple model runs), c) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models).",
            "Step 3: PPD Implementation": "Implement the Probabilistic Prompt Decomposition method. This involves: a) Designing a prompt to generate task breakdowns, b) Implementing a parser to extract sub-tasks from the breakdown, c) Generating answers and confidence scores for each sub-task, d) Constructing a probabilistic graphical model from the sub-task results, e) Implementing an algorithm to propagate uncertainty through the graphical model.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our main experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in our dataset: a) Apply the baseline methods and record their outputs and confidence scores, b) Apply PPD and record the task breakdown, sub-task results, and final calibrated confidence score.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Compare the final answers from baselines and PPD, b) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess how well the confidence scores align with actual performance, c) Granularity: Analyze the distribution of confidence scores across sub-tasks to assess the method's ability to provide fine-grained uncertainty information.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: a) Compare PPD performance against baselines across different problem types, b) Analyze cases where PPD significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines, c) Examine the structure of task breakdowns and their impact on final performance, d) Investigate the relationship between sub-task confidences and overall task confidence."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 13. What is the value of x?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "To solve the equation 2x + 5 = 13, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1) First, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5\n   2x = 8\n\n2) Now, divide both sides by 2:\n   2x \u00f7 2 = 8 \u00f7 2\n   x = 4\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 4.\n\nConfidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Task Breakdown)": "Q: Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 13. What is the value of x?\n\nBreak down this problem into smaller sub-tasks. For each sub-task, provide a brief description of what needs to be done. Present the breakdown in a numbered list format.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Task Breakdown)": "1. Identify the equation: Recognize the given equation 2x + 5 = 13.\n2. Isolate variable term: Move all terms with x to one side of the equation.\n3. Isolate constant terms: Move all constant terms to the other side of the equation.\n4. Simplify: Combine like terms on each side of the equation.\n5. Solve for x: Perform the necessary operation to isolate x.\n6. Verify the solution: Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation to check if it's correct.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Sub-task Execution)": "Solve the following sub-task and provide a confidence score (0-100%):\n\nSub-task: Isolate variable term: Move all terms with x to one side of the equation.\nOriginal equation: 2x + 5 = 13",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Sub-task Execution)": "To isolate the variable term, we keep the term with x (2x) on the left side of the equation and move the constant term (5) to the right side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5\n2x = 8\n\nConfidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Final Answer Generation)": "Based on the sub-task results, provide the final answer to the original question: Solve the equation: 2x + 5 = 13. What is the value of x? Also, provide an overall confidence score based on the sub-task confidences.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Final Answer Generation)": "Based on the sub-task results, we can solve the equation 2x + 5 = 13 as follows:\n\n1. We isolated the variable term: 2x = 8\n2. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:\n   x = 8 \u00f7 2\n   x = 4\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 4.\n\nOverall Confidence: 96%\n\nThis overall confidence is based on the high confidence levels in each sub-task, slightly reduced to account for potential compounding of small uncertainties across steps.",
            "explanation": "The PPD method breaks down the problem into manageable sub-tasks, allowing for more granular confidence assessment. By solving each sub-task independently and then combining the results, we get a more nuanced understanding of the model's certainty at each step. This approach can potentially lead to more accurate and better-calibrated confidence scores compared to the baseline method, which provides a single confidence score for the entire problem."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed PPD method doesn't significantly improve calibration or provide more granular uncertainty information compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the task breakdowns generated by the model to gain insights into how LLMs approach problem-solving. This could lead to interesting findings about the model's reasoning process and potential areas for improvement. Second, we could investigate how different types of problems benefit (or don't benefit) from decomposition, potentially uncovering patterns that could inform future research on prompt engineering or model design. Third, we could explore alternative ways of combining sub-task confidences, such as using different graphical model structures or uncertainty propagation methods. This could lead to the development of new, more effective uncertainty quantification techniques. Lastly, we could conduct an in-depth error analysis to understand why PPD fails in certain cases, which could provide valuable insights for improving both prompting techniques and model architectures for better uncertainty estimation."
