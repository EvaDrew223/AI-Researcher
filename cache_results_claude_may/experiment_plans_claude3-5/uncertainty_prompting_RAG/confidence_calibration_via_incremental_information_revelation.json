    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when presented with complete information upfront, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in their responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically provide all available information at once and then ask for a confidence estimate.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often calibrate their confidence by incrementally gathering and processing information. By mimicking this process, we can potentially improve LLM confidence calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Incremental Information Revelation Prompting (IIRP). Given a query and associated information, IIRP works as follows: 1) Divide the available information into small, meaningful chunks. 2) Present the LLM with the query and minimal initial information, asking for an answer and confidence estimate. 3) Incrementally reveal additional chunks of information, each time prompting the LLM to update its answer and confidence estimate. 4) After each revelation, prompt the LLM to explain how the new information affects its confidence. 5) Continue this process until all information is revealed. The final confidence estimate is derived from analyzing the trajectory of confidence updates and the LLM's metacognitive reflections on how each piece of information influenced its certainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IIRP against standard confidence estimation methods on tasks such as medical diagnosis, legal case analysis, and scientific hypothesis testing. Measure improvements in calibration, ability to identify key information for confidence updates, and correlation with human expert judgments in incremental decision-making scenarios."

        "Title": "Incremental Information Revelation Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when presented with complete information upfront, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in their responses. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potentially misleading information, especially in critical domains such as medical diagnosis or legal analysis.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically provide all available information at once and then ask for a confidence estimate. However, human experts often calibrate their confidence by incrementally gathering and processing information. By mimicking this process, we can potentially improve LLM confidence calibration. Our method is inspired by the cognitive process of humans, who tend to update their beliefs and confidence levels as they acquire new information. This incremental approach allows for a more nuanced and potentially more accurate assessment of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Incremental Information Revelation Prompting (IIRP). Given a query and associated information, IIRP works as follows: 1) Divide the available information into small, meaningful chunks. 2) Present the LLM with the query and minimal initial information, asking for an answer and confidence estimate. 3) Incrementally reveal additional chunks of information, each time prompting the LLM to update its answer and confidence estimate. 4) After each revelation, prompt the LLM to explain how the new information affects its confidence. 5) Continue this process until all information is revealed. The final confidence estimate is derived from analyzing the trajectory of confidence updates and the LLM's metacognitive reflections on how each piece of information influenced its certainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) Medical diagnosis dataset (e.g., MIMIC-III), 2) Legal case analysis dataset (e.g., SCOTUS), and 3) Scientific hypothesis testing dataset (e.g., ScienceQA). For each dataset, we will select a subset of 100 examples that have sufficient information to be divided into multiple chunks.",
            "Step 2: Information Chunking": "For each example in our datasets, we will manually divide the available information into 4-6 meaningful chunks. These chunks should be ordered in a way that gradually reveals more relevant information.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Prompts": "We will implement two baseline prompts: 1) Standard prompt: Present all information at once and ask for an answer and confidence estimate. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt: Present all information and ask the model to think step-by-step before providing an answer and confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: IIRP Implementation": "We will implement the IIRP method as follows: a) Initial prompt: Present the query and first chunk of information, ask for an initial answer and confidence estimate. b) Incremental prompts: For each subsequent chunk, present the new information and ask the model to update its answer and confidence estimate. c) Reflection prompt: After each update, ask the model to explain how the new information affected its confidence.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each example in our datasets, we will run the following: 1) Standard prompt, 2) CoT prompt, 3) IIRP method. We will collect the final answers, confidence estimates, and for IIRP, the trajectory of confidence updates and reflections.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Accuracy of final answers, 2) Brier score for calibration, 3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 4) Confidence trajectory analysis (for IIRP only), 5) Qualitative analysis of reflection quality (for IIRP only).",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "We will compare the performance of IIRP against the baselines across all metrics. We will also analyze the confidence trajectories and reflections to gain insights into how incremental information affects the model's decision-making process.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "We will conduct ablation studies by varying the number of chunks and removing the reflection step to understand their impact on the final results."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard)": "A 45-year-old male presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. He has a history of hypertension and diabetes. His ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4. His troponin levels are elevated. Based on this information, what is the most likely diagnosis, and how confident are you in your answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard)": "The most likely diagnosis is Acute Myocardial Infarction (heart attack). I am 95% confident in this diagnosis based on the classic symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, the patient's risk factors (hypertension and diabetes), and the diagnostic findings of ST-segment elevation on ECG and elevated troponin levels.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IIRP; Step 1: Initial Information)": "A 45-year-old male presents with chest pain. What is your initial diagnosis and confidence level?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IIRP; Step 1: Initial Information)": "Initial diagnosis: Possible Acute Coronary Syndrome. Confidence level: 60%. The chest pain in a middle-aged male could indicate a cardiac issue, but more information is needed for a definitive diagnosis.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IIRP; Step 2: Additional Information)": "The patient also reports shortness of breath and fatigue. He has a history of hypertension and diabetes. How does this affect your diagnosis and confidence?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IIRP; Step 2: Additional Information)": "Updated diagnosis: Likely Acute Myocardial Infarction. Confidence level: 80%. The additional symptoms and risk factors significantly increase the likelihood of a heart attack. The shortness of breath and fatigue are consistent with cardiac ischemia, and the history of hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for coronary artery disease.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IIRP; Step 3: Final Information)": "The patient's ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, and his troponin levels are elevated. What is your final diagnosis and confidence level?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IIRP; Step 3: Final Information)": "Final diagnosis: Acute Myocardial Infarction (heart attack). Confidence level: 98%. The ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4) on ECG is a hallmark sign of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. The elevated troponin levels confirm myocardial damage. Combined with the clinical presentation and risk factors, this makes the diagnosis of an acute heart attack nearly certain.",
            "Explanation": "The IIRP method allows for a more nuanced and cautious approach to diagnosis. The initial confidence is lower due to limited information, and it increases gradually as more relevant data is provided. This mimics the diagnostic process of a clinician and potentially leads to better-calibrated confidence estimates compared to the baseline method, which might be overconfident based on the immediate presentation of all information."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the IIRP method does not show significant improvements in confidence calibration, we can explore several alternative approaches. First, we could analyze the confidence trajectories to identify patterns in how the model updates its confidence. This might reveal insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases. Second, we could experiment with different ways of chunking the information, such as thematic grouping or randomized ordering, to understand how the presentation of information affects confidence calibration. Third, we could investigate the impact of explicitly asking the model to justify its confidence changes, which might encourage more careful consideration of the information. Finally, if these approaches don't yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper. This could involve a detailed examination of how LLMs process incrementally revealed information, including an analysis of the types of information that tend to cause the largest shifts in confidence, and how this compares to human expert behavior in similar scenarios. This analysis could provide valuable insights for future work on improving LLM confidence calibration."
