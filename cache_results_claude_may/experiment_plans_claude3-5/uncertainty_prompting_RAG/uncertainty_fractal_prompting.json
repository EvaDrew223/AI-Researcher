        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often provide coarse-grained estimates that fail to capture the nuanced, hierarchical nature of uncertainty across different levels of abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-level uncertainty estimation, such as using softmax probabilities or ensemble disagreement.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by fractal geometry, where patterns repeat at different scales, we propose that uncertainty in language models can be better understood and quantified through a hierarchical, self-similar structure.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Fractal Prompting (UFP), a novel method that recursively decomposes a given task into increasingly granular subtasks, estimating uncertainty at each level. The process begins with a high-level prompt for the main task, then uses the LLM to generate sub-prompts that break down the task into smaller components. This decomposition continues for several levels, creating a tree-like structure. At each node, we prompt the LLM to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The final uncertainty estimate is computed by aggregating these multi-level confidence scores, weighted by their position in the hierarchy. This fractal approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of where and how uncertainty manifests in the model's reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UFP against standard uncertainty estimation methods on a range of tasks including multi-hop reasoning, complex problem-solving, and open-ended generation. We'll use metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and a novel 'uncertainty depth' measure that quantifies how well the method captures hierarchical uncertainty structures."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Fractal Prompting: Hierarchical Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide coarse-grained estimates that fail to capture the nuanced, hierarchical nature of uncertainty across different levels of abstraction. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret the confidence of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-level uncertainty estimation, such as using softmax probabilities or ensemble disagreement. These methods often fall short in capturing the multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in language models. Inspired by fractal geometry, where patterns repeat at different scales, we propose that uncertainty in language models can be better understood and quantified through a hierarchical, self-similar structure. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of where and how uncertainty manifests in the model's reasoning process, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Fractal Prompting (UFP), a novel method that recursively decomposes a given task into increasingly granular subtasks, estimating uncertainty at each level. The process begins with a high-level prompt for the main task, then uses the LLM to generate sub-prompts that break down the task into smaller components. This decomposition continues for several levels, creating a tree-like structure. At each node, we prompt the LLM to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The final uncertainty estimate is computed by aggregating these multi-level confidence scores, weighted by their position in the hierarchy.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require multi-step reasoning: (1) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving, (2) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, and (3) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning. These datasets will help evaluate UFP's performance across different types of complex tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty quantification methods: (1) Softmax probabilities, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (3) Ensemble disagreement using different few-shot prompts. For each method, we'll use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs to generate answers and uncertainty estimates for all questions in the datasets.",
            "Step 3: UFP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Fractal Prompting method: (a) For each question, generate a tree of sub-questions using the LLM. Use the prompt: 'Break down this question into 3 sub-questions that would help answer the main question: [QUESTION]'. Repeat this process for each sub-question up to a depth of 3. (b) For each node in the tree (including leaf nodes), prompt the LLM to answer the question and provide a confidence score (0-100). Use the prompt: 'Answer this question and provide a confidence score (0-100): [QUESTION]'. (c) Aggregate the confidence scores using a weighted sum, where weights decrease with depth (e.g., 1.0 for root, 0.7 for level 1, 0.5 for level 2).",
            "Step 4: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method (baselines and UFP): (a) Calculate calibration error using Expected Calibration Error (ECE). (b) Compute Brier score to assess probabilistic forecast accuracy. (c) Implement a novel 'uncertainty depth' measure that quantifies how well the method captures hierarchical uncertainty structures. This can be done by comparing the variance of uncertainty estimates at different levels of the UFP tree. (d) Measure the correlation between model uncertainty and human uncertainty by collecting human confidence ratings for a subset of questions and comparing them with model estimates.",
            "Step 5: Analysis": "Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the results: (a) Compare UFP performance against baselines across all metrics and datasets. (b) Analyze how UFP's performance varies with task complexity and domain. (c) Investigate the relationship between the structure of the generated question trees and the final uncertainty estimates. (d) Examine cases where UFP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines, and analyze the characteristics of these cases.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of UFP: (a) Vary the depth of the question tree (1, 2, 3, 4 levels) and analyze its impact on performance. (b) Experiment with different weighting schemes for aggregating confidence scores. (c) Compare UFP's performance when using different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4) for generating the question tree and answering questions."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Softmax Probabilities)": "Q: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to his friend, how many apples does he have left? Provide your answer and the probability of your answer being correct.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Softmax Probabilities)": "Answer: John has 3 apples left. Probability: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UFP; Root Question)": "Q: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to his friend, how many apples does he have left? Break this question down into 3 sub-questions that would help answer the main question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UFP; Root Question)": "1. How many apples did John start with?\n2. How many apples did John give away?\n3. How do we calculate the remaining apples?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UFP; Sub-question 1)": "Q: How many apples did John start with? Answer this question and provide a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UFP; Sub-question 1)": "Answer: John started with 5 apples. Confidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UFP; Sub-question 2)": "Q: How many apples did John give away? Answer this question and provide a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UFP; Sub-question 2)": "Answer: John gave away 2 apples. Confidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UFP; Sub-question 3)": "Q: How do we calculate the remaining apples? Answer this question and provide a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UFP; Sub-question 3)": "Answer: We calculate the remaining apples by subtracting the number of apples given away from the initial number of apples. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UFP; Final Answer)": "Q: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to his friend, how many apples does he have left? Use the information from the sub-questions to answer this question and provide a final confidence score (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UFP; Final Answer)": "Answer: John has 3 apples left. Final confidence score: 98",
            "explanation": "UFP provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by breaking down the problem into sub-questions and aggregating confidence scores. This allows for identification of specific areas of uncertainty within the reasoning process, which is not captured by the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UFP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated question trees to understand how LLMs decompose complex problems. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential limitations. (2) Investigate the relationship between task complexity and the effectiveness of hierarchical uncertainty estimation. We could develop a complexity metric for tasks and analyze how it correlates with the performance gap between UFP and baselines. (3) Explore alternative aggregation methods for the hierarchical confidence scores, such as using machine learning models trained on human judgments to weight different levels of the tree. (4) Extend the study to examine how UFP performs in detecting out-of-distribution samples or adversarial inputs, which could be valuable for improving AI safety. These alternative directions could turn the project into an insightful analysis of LLM reasoning and uncertainty, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
