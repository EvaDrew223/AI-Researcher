        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods often fail to capture the full range of possible interpretations and solutions for a given query, leading to overconfidence in narrow interpretations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on a single line of reasoning or interpretation when estimating uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting the model to explore multiple divergent interpretations before converging on a final answer and uncertainty estimate, we can obtain a more comprehensive and robust measure of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent-Convergent Uncertainty Estimation (DCUE), a two-phase prompting approach. In the divergent phase, the model is prompted to generate multiple distinct interpretations or approaches to the query: '1. Provide 3 different interpretations of the query. 2. For each interpretation, generate a possible answer and reasoning.' In the convergent phase, the model synthesizes these divergent views: '3. Analyze the similarities and differences between the interpretations and answers. 4. Provide a final answer that best reconciles the different viewpoints. 5. Estimate your confidence based on the degree of convergence or divergence in the interpretations.' The final uncertainty estimate is derived from this convergence analysis.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare DCUE with single-interpretation uncertainty estimation methods on complex, ambiguous queries from datasets like AmbigQA. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error and the ability to identify truly ambiguous queries where high uncertainty is warranted."

        "Title": "Divergent-Convergent Uncertainty Estimation: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture the full range of possible interpretations and solutions for a given query, leading to overconfidence in narrow interpretations. This results in poor calibration and unreliable uncertainty estimates, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on a single line of reasoning or interpretation when estimating uncertainty, which can lead to overconfident and potentially inaccurate assessments. By explicitly prompting the model to explore multiple divergent interpretations before converging on a final answer and uncertainty estimate, we can obtain a more comprehensive and robust measure of uncertainty. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where considering multiple perspectives often leads to more nuanced and well-calibrated judgments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent-Convergent Uncertainty Estimation (DCUE), a two-phase prompting approach. In the divergent phase, the model is prompted to generate multiple distinct interpretations or approaches to the query: '1. Provide 3 different interpretations of the query. 2. For each interpretation, generate a possible answer and reasoning.' In the convergent phase, the model synthesizes these divergent views: '3. Analyze the similarities and differences between the interpretations and answers. 4. Provide a final answer that best reconciles the different viewpoints. 5. Estimate your confidence based on the degree of convergence or divergence in the interpretations.' The final uncertainty estimate is derived from this convergence analysis.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the AmbigQA dataset, which contains ambiguous questions with multiple valid interpretations and answers. We will also use a subset of the TriviaQA dataset for comparison on more straightforward questions. For each dataset, we will randomly select 1000 questions for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: 1) Direct answering with confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models). 3) Ensemble of model outputs (using different temperature settings). 4) Single-interpretation chain-of-thought with confidence estimation.",
            "Step 3: DCUE Implementation": "Implement the DCUE method using the following prompt template: 'Question: {question}\n1. Provide 3 different interpretations of this question.\n2. For each interpretation, generate a possible answer and reasoning.\n3. Analyze the similarities and differences between the interpretations and answers.\n4. Provide a final answer that best reconciles the different viewpoints.\n5. Estimate your confidence (0-100%) based on the degree of convergence or divergence in the interpretations.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. If computational resources allow, we will also include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM from Google.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration Error: difference between confidence and accuracy. 3) Brier Score: measures both calibration and resolution of probabilistic predictions. 4) AUC-ROC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for confidence scores. 5) F1 score for identifying truly ambiguous questions (for AmbigQA dataset).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run all baseline methods and DCUE. 2) Collect model outputs, including answers, confidence scores, and intermediate reasoning steps. 3) Calculate all evaluation metrics. 4) Repeat the process 3 times with different random seeds to ensure stability.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare DCUE performance against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze how DCUE performs on ambiguous vs. straightforward questions. 3) Examine the quality and diversity of generated interpretations in the divergent phase. 4) Investigate how the number of interpretations affects performance and computational cost. 5) Analyze cases where DCUE significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?",
                "Baseline Method (Direct Answering) Output": "Roald Amundsen was the first person to reach the South Pole on December 14, 1911. Confidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single, confident answer without considering potential ambiguities or alternative interpretations."
            },
            "Example 2 (DCUE Success)": {
                "Input": "Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?",
                "DCUE Output": "1. Interpretations:\na) First person to physically reach the South Pole.\nb) First person to reach the South Pole and return alive.\nc) First person to reach the vicinity of the South Pole using modern technology.\n\n2. Possible answers and reasoning:\na) Roald Amundsen on December 14, 1911. He led the first successful expedition to reach the geographic South Pole.\nb) Roald Amundsen, as he not only reached the South Pole first but also returned safely, unlike his competitor Robert Falcon Scott.\nc) It could be argued that modern scientists or researchers using advanced technology like satellites or drones 'reached' the South Pole first in terms of data collection.\n\n3. Analysis: The interpretations mainly differ in the definition of 'reaching' the South Pole - whether it's physical presence, successful return, or remote sensing. The first two interpretations converge on Roald Amundsen, while the third introduces a modern perspective.\n\n4. Final answer: Roald Amundsen is generally considered the first person to reach the South Pole, achieving this on December 14, 1911. He led the first expedition to physically reach the geographic South Pole and return safely.\n\n5. Confidence: 85%. While there's strong agreement on Amundsen for the traditional interpretation, the existence of alternative viewpoints (like remote sensing) slightly reduces confidence. The question's potential for different interpretations suggests some inherent ambiguity.",
                "Explanation": "DCUE explores multiple interpretations, considers potential ambiguities, and provides a more nuanced final answer with a better-calibrated confidence score."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DCUE doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated interpretations to understand why they didn't lead to better uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing the types of interpretations and their relevance to the questions. 2) Investigate how the number and diversity of interpretations correlate with performance, which could lead to insights on optimal prompting strategies. 3) Explore combining DCUE with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration post-processing. 4) Analyze the relationship between question ambiguity and DCUE performance, which could lead to a method for automatically detecting ambiguous queries. 5) If DCUE shows promise on specific types of questions or domains, we could focus on developing specialized versions of the method for those areas."
