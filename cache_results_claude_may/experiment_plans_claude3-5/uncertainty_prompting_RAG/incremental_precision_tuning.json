        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overconfident responses even when their knowledge is imprecise or incomplete.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches attempt to estimate uncertainty in a single step or through limited iterations.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often refine the precision of their statements incrementally when pressed for more specific information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Incremental Precision Tuning (IPT), a multi-turn prompting strategy that progressively increases the granularity of the model's output. IPT starts with a high-level, general response to a query. In subsequent turns, it prompts the model to provide increasingly specific details, while explicitly asking about confidence at each level of precision. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to maintain consistency across turns while revealing uncertainty as the required precision increases. IPT tracks how quickly confidence decreases with increasing precision as a measure of underlying uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IPT against baselines on tasks requiring varying levels of precision, such as numerical estimation, date prediction, and geographic location specification. Assess performance using calibration scores, correlation with true error, and expert evaluation of uncertainty progression."

        "Title": "Incremental Precision Tuning: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Progressive Refinement",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overconfident responses even when their knowledge is imprecise or incomplete, leading to unreliable outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically rely on single-step approaches or limited iterations, which may not capture the nuanced levels of confidence across different levels of precision. Human experts, in contrast, often refine the precision of their statements incrementally when pressed for more specific information. This observation motivates our approach to mimic this human-like behavior in LLMs, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification and better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Incremental Precision Tuning (IPT), a multi-turn prompting strategy that progressively increases the granularity of the model's output. IPT starts with a high-level, general response to a query. In subsequent turns, it prompts the model to provide increasingly specific details, while explicitly asking about confidence at each level of precision. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to maintain consistency across turns while revealing uncertainty as the required precision increases. IPT tracks how quickly confidence decreases with increasing precision as a measure of underlying uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare datasets for three types of tasks requiring varying levels of precision: (1) Numerical estimation: Use a subset of the GSM8K dataset for math word problems. (2) Date prediction: Create a custom dataset of historical events with varying levels of date precision (year, month, day). (3) Geographic location specification: Use a subset of the GeoQuery dataset, augmented with additional location-based questions at different granularities (continent, country, state/province, city, neighborhood).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: Ask the question directly without any special prompting. (2) Single-step confidence estimation: Ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score in a single step. (3) Monte Carlo Dropout: If using an open-source model, apply MC Dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: IPT Implementation": "Implement the IPT method with the following steps: (1) Initial response: Prompt the model for a high-level answer. (2) Confidence estimation: Ask the model to provide a confidence score for the initial answer. (3) Precision increase: Prompt the model to provide a more precise answer. (4) Repeat steps 2-3 for increasing levels of precision (e.g., 3-5 levels depending on the task). (5) Track confidence scores across precision levels.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of IPT. For example: Initial: 'Provide a general answer to [QUESTION].' Confidence: 'On a scale of 0-100, how confident are you in your previous answer?' Precision increase: 'Now, provide a more precise answer to [QUESTION]. Be more specific than your previous response.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the main experiments. Additionally, use the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison and to enable MC Dropout baseline.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and IPT. For each question, record the model's responses, confidence scores, and the ground truth.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence scores with its actual accuracy. (2) Confidence-precision correlation: Measure how well the confidence scores correlate with increasing precision levels. (3) Answer consistency: Evaluate the consistency of answers across different precision levels. (4) Final accuracy: Compare the accuracy of the final (most precise) answers between IPT and baselines.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis: (1) Compare IPT performance against baselines across different tasks and models. (2) Analyze how confidence changes with precision for different types of questions. (3) Identify cases where IPT significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. (4) Examine the relationship between initial confidence and final accuracy."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "When was the Treaty of Versailles signed?",

            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPT Step 6)": "On a scale of 0-100, how confident are you in your previous answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPT Step 6)": "85",
            "Explanation": "IPT allows the model to express higher confidence in more general statements and lower confidence as precision increases, potentially providing a more accurate representation of the model's uncertainty compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If IPT does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can explore several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the patterns of confidence decay across different question types and difficulty levels. This might reveal insights into when and why IPT is more or less effective. Second, we could experiment with different prompting strategies for eliciting confidence scores, such as asking for explanations of confidence levels or using more fine-grained confidence scales. Third, we could investigate combining IPT with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, if the results are still not promising, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper, focusing on understanding the limitations of current uncertainty quantification methods in LLMs and proposing theoretical frameworks for improving them based on our observations from the IPT experiments."
