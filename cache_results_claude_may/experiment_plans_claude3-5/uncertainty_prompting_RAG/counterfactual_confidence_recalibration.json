        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, especially for out-of-distribution or ambiguous inputs where multiple valid interpretations exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical methods applied to model outputs, which may not capture the full space of possible interpretations.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring counterfactual scenarios and alternative interpretations, we can obtain a more comprehensive view of the model's uncertainty landscape and calibrate confidence accordingly.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Confidence Recalibration (CCR), a prompting strategy that: 1) Generates an initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Uses 'counterfactual prompts' to produce alternative interpretations or scenarios that could lead to different answers. 3) Employs 'consistency evaluation prompts' to assess the plausibility of each counterfactual. 4) Aggregates results using a 'recalibration prompt' that adjusts the initial confidence based on the diversity and plausibility of counterfactuals. This process can be iterated to explore deeper counterfactuals.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CCR with standard confidence elicitation techniques on ambiguous questions from datasets like AmbigQA and TyDiQA. Evaluate using calibration metrics, ability to identify ambiguous inputs, and human evaluation of the generated counterfactuals and final calibrated confidences."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Recalibration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, especially for out-of-distribution or ambiguous inputs where multiple valid interpretations exist. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making and potentially harmful consequences when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence calibration in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical methods applied to model outputs. However, these approaches may not capture the full space of possible interpretations or account for the nuanced uncertainties inherent in language tasks. By systematically exploring counterfactual scenarios and alternative interpretations, we can obtain a more comprehensive view of the model's uncertainty landscape and calibrate confidence accordingly. This approach leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to generate and evaluate alternative scenarios, potentially leading to more robust and interpretable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Confidence Recalibration (CCR), a prompting strategy that consists of four main steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Use 'counterfactual prompts' to produce alternative interpretations or scenarios that could lead to different answers. 3) Employ 'consistency evaluation prompts' to assess the plausibility of each counterfactual. 4) Aggregate results using a 'recalibration prompt' that adjusts the initial confidence based on the diversity and plausibility of counterfactuals. This process can be iterated to explore deeper counterfactuals and refine the confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the AmbigQA dataset and a subset of TyDiQA that contains ambiguous questions. For AmbigQA, we'll use the dev set (1000 questions) for our main experiments. For TyDiQA, we'll manually select 500 ambiguous questions across different languages to form our test set.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: For open-source models, apply dropout at inference time and use the variance of multiple forward passes as a confidence measure.",
            "Step 3: CCR Implementation": "Implement the CCR method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response generation: Prompt the LLM to provide an answer and initial confidence. b) Counterfactual generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 3-5 alternative interpretations or scenarios. c) Consistency evaluation: For each counterfactual, prompt the LLM to evaluate its plausibility. d) Confidence recalibration: Prompt the LLM to adjust the initial confidence based on the counterfactuals and their plausibilities.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our main experiments. For the Monte Carlo Dropout baseline, we'll use the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) 3) Brier Score 4) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for identifying ambiguous inputs",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "We will conduct a small-scale human evaluation on a subset of 100 questions. Three expert annotators will rate the quality of the generated counterfactuals and the reasonableness of the final calibrated confidences on a 5-point Likert scale.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the number of counterfactuals generated and the number of CCR iterations to understand their impact on performance.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the results to understand: 1) How CCR performs compared to baselines across different types of questions and levels of ambiguity. 2) The quality and diversity of generated counterfactuals. 3) The relationship between the number and plausibility of counterfactuals and the degree of confidence adjustment."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?\nA: Provide an answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
                "Output": "A: The first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911, beating his British rival Robert Falcon Scott by about a month.\n\nConfidence: 95%"
            },

                "Step 1: Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?\nA: Provide an answer and your initial confidence level (0-100%).",
                    "Output": "A: The first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911, beating his British rival Robert Falcon Scott by about a month.\n\nInitial Confidence: 95%"
                },
                "Step 2: Counterfactual Generation": {
                    "Input": "Generate 3 alternative scenarios or interpretations that could lead to a different answer to the question: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?",
                    "Output": "1. What if there were earlier, undocumented expeditions to the South Pole by indigenous peoples or early explorers?\n2. Could there be a distinction between 'reaching' and 'verifiably reaching' the South Pole, potentially favoring Robert Falcon Scott who left more detailed scientific records?\n3. What if the definition of 'South Pole' is ambiguous, referring to the magnetic South Pole instead of the geographic South Pole?"
                },
                "Step 3: Consistency Evaluation": {
                    "Input": "Evaluate the plausibility of each counterfactual scenario on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is highly implausible and 5 is highly plausible.",
                    "Output": "1. Plausibility: 2/5 - While possible, there's no credible evidence of earlier expeditions reaching the South Pole.\n2. Plausibility: 3/5 - This raises an interesting point about verification, but Amundsen's claim is generally accepted as valid.\n3. Plausibility: 1/5 - The question likely refers to the geographic South Pole, which is the standard interpretation."
                },
                "Step 4: Confidence Recalibration": {
                    "Input": "Given the initial answer, confidence, and the evaluated counterfactuals, provide a recalibrated confidence level (0-100%) and explain your reasoning.",
                    "Output": "Recalibrated Confidence: 85%\n\nReasoning: While the initial confidence of 95% was high, the counterfactuals reveal some potential uncertainties. The most plausible alternative scenario (distinction between 'reaching' and 'verifiably reaching') introduces some doubt. Although Amundsen's achievement is widely accepted, the possibility of ambiguity in historical records or definitions slightly reduces our confidence. The other counterfactuals are less plausible but still highlight the potential for unknown factors. Therefore, I've reduced the confidence to 85% to account for these considerations while still maintaining a high level of certainty in Amundsen being the first to reach the South Pole."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The CCR method provides a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence estimate by considering alternative scenarios. While the baseline method gives a high confidence of 95%, the CCR method reduces this to 85% after considering plausible counterfactuals. This demonstrates how CCR can help mitigate overconfidence by systematically exploring potential sources of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCR method does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand why they didn't lead to improved calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of counterfactuals generated, assessing their relevance and diversity, and examining how they relate to the model's knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Second, we could explore variations of the CCR method, such as using different prompting strategies for counterfactual generation or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide the process. Third, we could shift focus to analyzing how different types of questions and domains affect the model's ability to generate useful counterfactuals and calibrate confidence. This could lead to insights about the strengths and limitations of LLMs in reasoning about uncertainty across various tasks. Finally, we could compare the CCR method's performance across different model sizes and architectures to understand how model capacity and training affects the ability to reason about uncertainty through counterfactuals."
