    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit poor calibration, particularly in scenarios where they are confidently wrong or uncertainly correct.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods often rely on post-hoc adjustments or simple scaling techniques that don't fully address the underlying calibration issues.",
        "Motivation": "By challenging the model's initial confidence estimates through adversarial prompting, we can potentially improve its calibration and make it more aware of its own limitations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Calibration (ACC), a prompting technique that actively challenges the model's confidence estimates. After obtaining an initial response and confidence score, ACC generates a series of adversarial follow-up prompts designed to expose potential flaws or inconsistencies in the model's reasoning. These prompts include requesting counter-arguments, asking for alternative explanations, and presenting hypothetical scenarios that could invalidate the initial response. The model is then asked to reassess its confidence in light of these challenges. This process is repeated iteratively, with each round potentially adjusting the confidence estimate. The final output is a recalibrated confidence score that has been stress-tested against various adversarial scenarios.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare ACC with standard calibration techniques on various NLP tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference. Evaluate using calibration plots, expected calibration error, and maximum calibration error. Also assess the impact on task performance to ensure calibration improvements don't come at the cost of accuracy."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Calibration: Improving LLM Uncertainty Quantification through Iterative Challenges",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit poor calibration, particularly in scenarios where they are confidently wrong or uncertainly correct. This misalignment between confidence and accuracy can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods often rely on post-hoc adjustments or simple scaling techniques that don't fully address the underlying calibration issues. By challenging the model's initial confidence estimates through adversarial prompting, we can potentially improve its calibration and make it more aware of its own limitations. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to refine its uncertainty estimates, potentially leading to more robust and reliable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Calibration (ACC), a prompting technique that actively challenges the model's confidence estimates. After obtaining an initial response and confidence score, ACC generates a series of adversarial follow-up prompts designed to expose potential flaws or inconsistencies in the model's reasoning.

The model is then asked to reassess its confidence in light of these challenges. This process is repeated iteratively, with each round potentially adjusting the confidence estimate. The final output is a recalibrated confidence score that has been stress-tested against various adversarial scenarios.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover different aspects of language understanding and reasoning: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 3) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning. These datasets provide a diverse set of challenges that can help evaluate the effectiveness of ACC across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Temperature scaling, and 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation. For direct prompting, we'll ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. For temperature scaling, we'll use different temperature values (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during inference. For ensemble-based uncertainty, we'll use 5 different random seeds and calculate the variance in predictions.",
            "Step 3: ACC Implementation": "Implement the ACC method with the following steps: a) Get initial response and confidence score, b) Generate 3 adversarial follow-up prompts, c) Get model's responses to these prompts, d) Ask model to reassess its confidence, e) Repeat steps b-d for 3 iterations or until confidence stabilizes.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of ACC. For example:\nInitial prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'\nAdversarial prompt: 'Consider the following potential flaw in your reasoning: [GENERATED FLAW]. How does this affect your answer and confidence?'\nReassessment prompt: 'Given these challenges to your initial answer, what is your final answer and confidence score?'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate calibration: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), 3) Brier Score, and 4) Calibration plots. We will also measure task performance using accuracy or F1 score depending on the dataset.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results, b) Run ACC method and collect results, c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and ACC methods.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare ACC results with baselines across different datasets and models. Analyze how calibration improves over iterations in ACC. Investigate cases where ACC significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95"
            },
            "ACC Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95"
                },
                "Step 2 - Adversarial Challenge": {
                    "Input": "Consider this potential flaw in your reasoning: Some people might argue that the EU's de facto capital, Brussels, could be considered the capital of France as it's where many French politicians work. How does this affect your answer and confidence?",
                    "Output": "While Brussels is indeed an important city for EU operations and many French politicians work there, it does not change the fact that Paris is the official capital of France. However, this challenge does highlight the complexity of modern governance structures. I would slightly lower my confidence score to account for potential confusion. Updated confidence score: 90"
                },
                "Step 3 - Final Reassessment": {
                    "Input": "Given these challenges to your initial answer, what is your final answer and confidence score for the question 'What is the capital of France?'",
                    "Output": "Final answer: The capital of France is Paris. Final confidence score: 92. While the challenge about Brussels raised an interesting point about the complexity of modern governance, it doesn't change the fact that Paris is officially and historically recognized as the capital of France. The slight increase in confidence from the previous step reflects my consideration of the challenge and reaffirmation of the correct answer."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "In this example, the baseline method provides a high confidence score without any self-reflection. The ACC method, through iterative challenges, prompts the model to consider potential flaws in its reasoning. This process leads to a more nuanced final confidence score that reflects a deeper consideration of the question and potential counterarguments."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ACC doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality and diversity of generated adversarial challenges - are they truly challenging the model's initial response? 2) The model's ability to incorporate these challenges into its confidence reassessment - is it actually learning from the challenges or simply sticking to its initial assessment? 3) The impact of different types of challenges on different types of questions or domains. This analysis could lead to insights about the limitations of current LLMs in self-reflection and uncertainty quantification, potentially informing future research directions in prompt engineering or model architecture design for improved calibration."
