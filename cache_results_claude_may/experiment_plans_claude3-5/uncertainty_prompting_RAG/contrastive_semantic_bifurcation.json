        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to express nuanced uncertainties when faced with semantically similar but subtly different concepts or scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-path reasoning or simple ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting LLMs to reason along divergent semantic paths and contrast their implications, we can better capture subtle uncertainties and ambiguities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Semantic Bifurcation (CSB), a prompting technique that guides the LLM to: 1) Identify two maximally different but plausible interpretations of the input query. 2) Reason separately along each path, generating intermediate steps and confidence estimates. 3) Explicitly contrast the two paths, highlighting key differences and implications. 4) Synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate that accounts for both paths. The prompts are designed to encourage the LLM to deeply explore semantic nuances and potential ambiguities.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CSB on tasks requiring nuanced understanding, such as ambiguous language interpretation and ethical reasoning scenarios. We'll compare against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods, measuring the ability to capture subtle uncertainties and provide well-calibrated confidence estimates."

        "Title": "Contrastive Semantic Bifurcation: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to express nuanced uncertainties when faced with semantically similar but subtly different concepts or scenarios. This limitation can lead to overconfident or inconsistent responses, potentially misleading users in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on single-path reasoning or simple ensemble methods, which may not capture the full spectrum of semantic nuances and potential ambiguities. By explicitly prompting LLMs to reason along divergent semantic paths and contrast their implications, we can better capture subtle uncertainties and ambiguities. This approach leverages the LLM's inherent language understanding capabilities to perform a more thorough exploration of the semantic space, potentially leading to more accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Semantic Bifurcation (CSB), a prompting technique that guides the LLM through four key steps: 1) Identify two maximally different but plausible interpretations of the input query. 2) Reason separately along each path, generating intermediate steps and confidence estimates. 3) Explicitly contrast the two paths, highlighting key differences and implications. 4) Synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate that accounts for both paths. The prompts are designed to encourage the LLM to deeply explore semantic nuances and potential ambiguities.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require nuanced understanding: 1) WinoGrande for coreference resolution, 2) AmbigQA for ambiguous question answering, and 3) MoralQA for ethical reasoning scenarios. These datasets cover a range of tasks where subtle semantic differences can lead to significant changes in interpretation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly asking the question. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: appending 'Let's think about this step by step' to the question. 3) Few-shot CoT: providing 2-3 examples of step-by-step reasoning before the target question.",
            "Step 3: CSB Prompt Design": "Design the CSB prompt template with four components: a) Bifurcation: 'Identify two distinct interpretations of this query.' b) Dual reasoning: 'For each interpretation, provide a step-by-step reasoning process and a confidence estimate.' c) Contrast: 'Compare and contrast the two interpretations, highlighting key differences.' d) Synthesis: 'Provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate that accounts for both interpretations.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and CSB): 1) Process each question through the chosen model using the appropriate prompting method. 2) Record the model's final answer, confidence/uncertainty estimate, and any intermediate reasoning steps. 3) For CSB, also record the two interpretations and the contrast analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Answer Accuracy: Compare model outputs to ground truth answers. 2) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between the model's confidence estimates and its actual accuracy. 3) Uncertainty Quality: Use proper scoring rules like Brier score or log loss to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates. 4) Semantic Diversity: For CSB, evaluate the distinctness of the two interpretations using embedding similarity.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare CSB performance against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze cases where CSB significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. 3) Examine the relationship between interpretation diversity and uncertainty estimate quality. 4) Investigate how often the final synthesized answer differs from both initial interpretations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too small. What is too small?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The suitcase is too small.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSB Prompting)": "Q: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too small. What is too small?\n\n1) Identify two distinct interpretations of this query.\n2) For each interpretation, provide a step-by-step reasoning process and a confidence estimate.\n3) Compare and contrast the two interpretations, highlighting key differences.\n4) Provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate that accounts for both interpretations.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSB Prompting)": "1) Two distinct interpretations:\na) The suitcase is too small to fit the trophy.\nb) The trophy is too small to fit properly in the suitcase.\n\n2) Reasoning for each interpretation:\na) The suitcase is too small:\nStep 1: The sentence states that something doesn't fit.\nStep 2: Generally, when an object doesn't fit, it's because the container is too small.\nStep 3: The suitcase is the container in this scenario.\nConfidence: 80%\n\nb) The trophy is too small:\nStep 1: The sentence uses 'it's' which could refer to either the trophy or the suitcase.\nStep 2: If the trophy is too small, it might move around too much in the suitcase.\nStep 3: This could be interpreted as not 'fitting' properly.\nConfidence: 20%\n\n3) Contrast:\nThe key difference lies in which object 'it's' refers to. Interpretation (a) assumes 'it's' refers to the suitcase, which is more common in everyday language. Interpretation (b) considers an unusual but possible reading where 'it's' refers to the trophy.\n\n4) Final answer and uncertainty estimate:\nBased on the more likely interpretation and common usage, the suitcase is probably too small. However, there is some ambiguity in the sentence structure.\n\nFinal answer: The suitcase is too small.\nUncertainty estimate: 25% (moderate uncertainty due to the grammatical ambiguity)",
            "Explanation": "The CSB approach explicitly considers multiple interpretations, leading to a more nuanced final answer with a quantified uncertainty estimate. This contrasts with the baseline approach, which provides a single interpretation without expressing uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSB doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on the nature of semantic ambiguities in LLMs. We would analyze: 1) The types of ambiguities that LLMs struggle with most. 2) How different prompting methods affect the model's ability to recognize and express uncertainty. 3) The relationship between the model's ability to generate diverse interpretations and its uncertainty estimates. 4) How the model's performance varies across different types of tasks (e.g., coreference resolution vs. ethical reasoning). This analysis could provide valuable insights into the semantic processing capabilities of LLMs and inform future research on improving their handling of ambiguous or uncertain scenarios."
