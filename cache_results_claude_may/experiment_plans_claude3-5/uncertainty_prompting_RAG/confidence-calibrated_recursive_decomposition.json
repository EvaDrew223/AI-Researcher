        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Recursive Decomposition: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their confidence in complex multi-step reasoning tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks requiring intricate problem-solving steps, where errors can compound and lead to misleading final outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like Chain-of-Thought prompting have shown promise in improving reasoning capabilities but don't explicitly address confidence calibration. By recursively breaking down complex problems and assessing confidence at each step, we can obtain a more granular and accurate overall confidence estimate. This approach leverages the model's ability to perform better on simpler sub-tasks and combines these assessments to produce a more reliable final confidence score.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence-Calibrated Recursive Decomposition (CCRD), which involves five key steps: 1) Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the problem into sub-problems. 2) Sub-problem Solving: For each sub-problem, generate a solution and a confidence score. 3) Confidence Aggregation: Combine sub-problem confidences using a prompted aggregation function. 4) Iteration: If confidence is below a threshold, prompt for further decomposition of low-confidence sub-problems. 5) Final Answer: Generate the final answer with an overall confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: GSM8K for mathematical reasoning and MATH for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets are chosen for their multi-step nature and varying difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are chosen for their strong performance on reasoning tasks and their ability to follow complex instructions.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: Directly ask the model to solve the problem and provide a confidence score. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use the standard CoT prompt and ask for a final confidence score.",
            "Step 4: CCRD Implementation": "Implement the CCRD method with the following sub-steps: a) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down this problem into 2-4 simpler sub-problems. List them as Step 1, Step 2, etc.' b) Sub-problem solving prompt: 'Solve this sub-problem and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100.' c) Confidence aggregation prompt: 'Given these sub-problem solutions and confidence scores, provide an overall solution and confidence score.' d) Iteration prompt: 'The confidence is below our threshold of 70. Please further break down the sub-problem with the lowest confidence.' e) Final answer prompt: 'Based on all the sub-problem solutions and confidence scores, provide a final answer and overall confidence score.'",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the datasets: 1) Apply standard prompting and record the answer and confidence. 2) Apply CoT prompting and record the answer and confidence. 3) Apply CCRD and record the decomposition, sub-problem solutions, confidence scores, and final answer with confidence.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Percentage of correct final answers. 2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure of calibration between confidence and accuracy. 3) Brier Score: Quadratic scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 4) Average Confidence: Compare the average confidence scores across methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform additional analyses: 1) Decomposition quality: Manually review a subset of decompositions for relevance and completeness. 2) Confidence distribution: Compare the distribution of confidence scores across methods. 3) Iteration impact: Analyze how additional decomposition iterations affect final accuracy and confidence. 4) Error analysis: Identify common patterns in problems where CCRD underperforms."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Also, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The average speed of the train is 60 miles per hour. To calculate this, we divide the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the time taken (2 hours). 120 miles \u00f7 2 hours = 60 miles per hour. Confidence score: 95",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Let's approach this step-by-step, and then provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. We know the train traveled a total distance of 120 miles.\n2. The time taken for this journey was 2 hours.\n3. The formula for average speed is: Average Speed = Total Distance \u00f7 Total Time\n4. Plugging in our values: Average Speed = 120 miles \u00f7 2 hours\n5. Calculating: 120 \u00f7 2 = 60\nTherefore, the average speed of the train is 60 miles per hour.\nConfidence score: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCRD; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Break down this problem into 2-4 simpler sub-problems. List them as Step 1, Step 2, etc.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCRD; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Step 1: Identify the formula for average speed.\nStep 2: Extract the total distance traveled from the problem.\nStep 3: Extract the total time taken from the problem.\nStep 4: Calculate the average speed using the formula and given information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCRD; Step 2: Sub-problem Solving)": "Solve this sub-problem and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: Step 1: Identify the formula for average speed.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CCRD; Step 2: Sub-problem Solving)": "The formula for average speed is: Average Speed = Total Distance \u00f7 Total Time\nConfidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCRD; Step 3: Confidence Aggregation)": "Given these sub-problem solutions and confidence scores, provide an overall solution and confidence score: [List all sub-problem solutions and confidence scores]",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CCRD; Step 3: Confidence Aggregation)": "Overall solution: The average speed of the train is 60 miles per hour. This is calculated by dividing the total distance (120 miles) by the total time (2 hours).\nOverall confidence score: 99",
            "explanation": "CCRD allows for a more systematic approach to problem-solving, breaking down the problem into manageable sub-problems. This method enables the model to assess its confidence at each step, potentially leading to a more accurate overall confidence score. The high confidence in this simple example demonstrates that the model is able to recognize when it has high certainty in its calculations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCRD method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration or accuracy compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the decomposition patterns to understand how the model breaks down problems and whether this correlates with task difficulty or model performance. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process. Second, we could investigate the relationship between sub-problem confidence scores and final answer accuracy, potentially revealing patterns in how local uncertainties propagate to global uncertainties. Third, we could explore different aggregation methods for sub-problem confidences, such as weighted averages or more complex functions, to see if these improve overall calibration. Lastly, we could compare CCRD performance across different types of reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematical, logical, common sense) to identify where this approach is most effective, turning the project into a comprehensive analysis of recursive decomposition in language model reasoning."
