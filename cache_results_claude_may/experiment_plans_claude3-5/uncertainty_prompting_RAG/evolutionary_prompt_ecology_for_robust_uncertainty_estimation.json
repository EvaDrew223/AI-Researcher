        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often lack robustness across diverse tasks and struggle to adapt to novel scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use fixed prompting strategies or simple ensembling techniques for uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "Evolutionary algorithms' ability to generate diverse, adaptive solutions could inspire a more robust and flexible approach to uncertainty estimation in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Evolutionary Prompt Ecology, a technique that evolves a diverse ecosystem of prompts for uncertainty estimation. The process involves: 1) Generating an initial population of prompts with various strategies for eliciting uncertainty (e.g., direct questioning, hypothetical scenarios, confidence scaling). 2) Evaluating prompts based on their performance across a range of tasks. 3) Applying genetic algorithms to create new generations of prompts, including mutation (random changes) and crossover (combining elements of successful prompts). 4) Maintaining a diverse ecology of prompts, each specialized for different types of queries. For any given query, multiple prompts from the ecology are used, and their results are aggregated for a final uncertainty estimate. Prompts evolve over time as they encounter new tasks. Example prompt template: 'Estimate uncertainty using method: [METHOD]. Consider factors: [FACTORS]. Provide confidence on scale: [SCALE].'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the evolved prompt ecology against fixed prompting strategies on a wide range of tasks, including out-of-distribution queries.

        "Title": "Evolutionary Prompt Ecology: Adaptive Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack robustness across diverse tasks and struggle to adapt to novel scenarios. This limitation hinders the reliable deployment of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is essential.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use fixed prompting strategies or simple ensembling techniques for uncertainty quantification, which may not generalize well across different tasks or adapt to new scenarios. Evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated the ability to generate diverse, adaptive solutions in various domains. By applying evolutionary principles to prompt generation for uncertainty estimation, we aim to create a more robust and flexible approach that can adapt to diverse tasks and novel scenarios, potentially outperforming existing fixed prompting strategies.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Evolutionary Prompt Ecology (EPE), a technique that evolves a diverse ecosystem of prompts for uncertainty estimation in LLMs. The process involves: 1) Generating an initial population of prompts with various strategies for eliciting uncertainty. 2) Evaluating prompts based on their performance across a range of tasks. 3) Applying genetic algorithms to create new generations of prompts, including mutation and crossover. 4) Maintaining a diverse ecology of prompts, each specialized for different types of queries. For any given query, multiple prompts from the ecology are used, and their results are aggregated for a final uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Collect diverse datasets covering different task types: a) MMLU for multi-domain knowledge, b) TruthfulQA for factual consistency, c) ARC for scientific reasoning, and d) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving. Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Initial Prompt Population": "Create an initial population of 100 prompts using various uncertainty elicitation strategies. Example strategies include direct questioning, hypothetical scenarios, confidence scaling, and alternative generation. Store prompts in a structured format, e.g., JSON, with fields for method, factors to consider, and confidence scale.",
            "Step 3: Evaluation Metric Design": "Implement evaluation metrics for uncertainty estimation: a) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), b) Sharpness (e.g., average confidence), c) Proper scoring rules (e.g., Brier score), and d) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy for classification tasks).",
            "Step 4: Baseline Implementation": "Implement baseline methods for comparison: a) Direct prompting, b) Few-shot prompting with fixed exemplars, c) Ensemble of fixed prompts, and d) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models).",
            "Step 5: Evolutionary Algorithm Implementation": "Implement the genetic algorithm for prompt evolution: a) Selection: Choose top-performing prompts based on evaluation metrics, b) Crossover: Combine elements of successful prompts, c) Mutation: Introduce random changes to prompts, d) Replacement: Update the population with new prompts.",
            "Step 6: Training Loop": "For each generation (e.g., 50 generations): a) Evaluate all prompts in the population on the training set, b) Apply the genetic algorithm to create a new generation, c) Evaluate the best prompts on the validation set to track progress.",
            "Step 7: Final Evaluation": "Evaluate the final evolved prompt ecology on the test sets of all datasets. Compare performance against baselines using the defined metrics.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of: a) Population size, b) Number of generations, c) Mutation rate, d) Crossover strategies, e) Selection pressure.",
            "Step 9: Adaptation Experiments": "Test the adaptability of the evolved prompt ecology on a new dataset (e.g., BIG-bench) not seen during training. Compare its performance against baselines and a newly trained prompt ecology specifically for this dataset.",
            "Step 10: Analysis": "Analyze the characteristics of successful prompts that emerged through evolution. Identify common patterns, effective uncertainty elicitation strategies, and task-specific adaptations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Consider the following factors: your knowledge of European geography, potential alternative answers, and any uncertainty in your information. Provide your best answer, list alternative possibilities if any, and express your confidence using the following scale: Very Low (0-20), Low (21-40), Moderate (41-60), High (61-80), Very High (81-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "A: Based on my knowledge of European geography, I can state with Very High confidence (95) that the capital of France is Paris. Alternative possibilities that I considered but deemed highly unlikely include: 1) Marseille (major city, but not the capital), 2) Lyon (another significant French city). The high confidence stems from the widespread and consistent information about Paris being France's capital, its historical significance, and its role as the seat of government.",
            "Explanation": "The evolved prompt elicits a more nuanced response, encouraging the model to consider alternative possibilities and express uncertainty more precisely. It also provides a structured format for the response, making it easier to extract and quantify the uncertainty estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Evolutionary Prompt Ecology method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several directions: 1) Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the evolved prompts to identify patterns and insights into effective uncertainty elicitation strategies. This could lead to a paper on prompt design principles for uncertainty estimation. 2) Investigate the failure modes of the evolutionary approach, such as potential overfitting to specific datasets or lack of diversity in the prompt population. This analysis could inform the development of improved evolutionary algorithms for prompt generation. 3) Explore hybrid approaches that combine evolved prompts with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration post-processing. 4) Shift focus to analyzing how different types of prompts affect the model's expressed uncertainty across various tasks, potentially uncovering insights into the model's internal representations of uncertainty."
