    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Single-perspective confidence estimation in LLMs can be biased or incomplete, missing important considerations that affect true uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on a single model perspective or simple ensembling, which may not capture the full range of relevant viewpoints for confidence estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating multiple personas with different expertise and viewpoints, we can achieve a more comprehensive and balanced assessment of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "Multi-Persona Confidence Consensus uses a structured prompting approach: 1) Define 3-5 distinct personas with varying expertise relevant to the task (e.g., expert, skeptic, generalist). 2) For each persona, generate a response to the task and a confidence estimate with justification. 3) Conduct a 'panel discussion' where personas critique each other's responses and confidence levels. 4) Synthesize a consensus confidence score, weighing the insights from all personas. 5) Provide a final meta-analysis of the consensus process, highlighting key areas of agreement and disagreement. The prompt includes specific instructions for role-playing each persona and guidelines for the consensus-building process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test on a range of tasks including factual QA, ethical reasoning (e.g., from ETHICS dataset), and scientific hypothesis evaluation. Compare against single-perspective confidence estimation and simple ensemble methods. Evaluate not only calibration metrics but also the quality and diversity of insights generated through the multi-persona approach."

        "Title": "Multi-Persona Confidence Consensus: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Single-perspective confidence estimation in Large Language Models (LLMs) can be biased or incomplete, missing important considerations that affect true uncertainty. This leads to overconfident or underconfident predictions, reducing the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on a single model perspective or simple ensembling, which may not capture the full range of relevant viewpoints for confidence estimation. By simulating multiple personas with different expertise and viewpoints, we can achieve a more comprehensive and balanced assessment of confidence. This approach is inspired by human decision-making processes, where diverse perspectives often lead to more robust and well-calibrated judgments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Persona Confidence Consensus (MPCC), a structured prompting approach that leverages multiple simulated personas to estimate confidence in LLM outputs. The method consists of five main steps: 1) Define 3-5 distinct personas with varying expertise relevant to the task (e.g., expert, skeptic, generalist). 2) For each persona, generate a response to the task and a confidence estimate with justification. 3) Conduct a 'panel discussion' where personas critique each other's responses and confidence levels. 4) Synthesize a consensus confidence score, weighing the insights from all personas. 5) Provide a final meta-analysis of the consensus process, highlighting key areas of agreement and disagreement.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) ETHICS dataset for ethical reasoning, and 3) ScienceQA for scientific hypothesis evaluation. Each dataset should be split into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Single-perspective confidence estimation: directly ask the LLM to provide a confidence score for its answer. 2) Simple ensemble: use 3-5 independent model calls and average their confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: MPCC Implementation": "Implement the Multi-Persona Confidence Consensus method with the following sub-steps: a) Define personas: Create prompts for 3-5 personas (e.g., 'You are an expert in [domain]', 'You are a skeptical analyst', 'You are a generalist with broad knowledge'). b) Generate initial responses: For each persona, generate an answer and confidence score. c) Panel discussion: Create a prompt for personas to critique each other's responses. d) Consensus synthesis: Prompt the LLM to synthesize a final confidence score based on the discussion. e) Meta-analysis: Generate a summary of key points of agreement and disagreement.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments. Additionally, we'll test GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-v1 to assess the generalizability of our method across different LLMs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) AUC-ROC: evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores. 4) Qualitative analysis: manually review a subset of outputs to assess the quality and diversity of insights generated through the multi-persona approach.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and record their performance. b) Run the MPCC method and record its performance. c) Compare the results using the defined evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: a) Vary the number of personas (2, 3, 5). b) Remove the panel discussion step. c) Use homogeneous vs. heterogeneous persona types.",
            "Step 8: Analysis and Visualization": "Create visualizations to compare the performance of baseline methods and MPCC across different tasks and models. Generate reliability diagrams to visualize calibration improvements."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-perspective)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-perspective)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Ensemble)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain. [Repeated 3 times with different model calls]",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Ensemble)": "Call 1: A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99\nCall 2: A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98\nCall 3: A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 1.0\nAverage confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 1: Define Personas)": "We will simulate a panel discussion with three personas to answer a question. The personas are:\n1. History Expert: You have extensive knowledge of world history and geography.\n2. Skeptical Analyst: You approach all claims with skepticism and look for potential errors or uncertainties.\n3. General Knowledge Enthusiast: You have broad knowledge across many fields but are not an expert in any specific area.\nEach persona will provide an answer and a confidence score, then discuss and critique each other's responses.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 2: Generate Initial Responses)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain. Respond as each persona:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPCC; Step 2: Generate Initial Responses)": "History Expert: The capital of France is Paris. This has been the case since 987 CE when Hugh Capet made it the capital of his kingdom. Confidence score: 1.0\n\nSkeptical Analyst: While it's widely accepted that Paris is the capital of France, it's important to note that capitals can change over time due to political decisions. However, I've found no credible sources suggesting any recent changes. Confidence score: 0.95\n\nGeneral Knowledge Enthusiast: I'm quite sure that Paris is the capital of France. It's a well-known fact that appears in many general knowledge sources. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 3: Panel Discussion)": "Now, each persona will critique the others' responses and confidence scores:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPCC; Step 3: Panel Discussion)": "History Expert: The Skeptical Analyst raises a valid point about capitals changing over time, but in this case, Paris has been the undisputed capital for over a millennium. The General Knowledge Enthusiast's confidence is well-placed.\n\nSkeptical Analyst: The History Expert's confidence of 1.0 seems slightly overconfident, as there's always a tiny possibility of very recent changes or unusual political circumstances we might not be aware of. The General Knowledge Enthusiast's score seems more appropriate.\n\nGeneral Knowledge Enthusiast: I appreciate the Historical Expert's additional context and the Skeptical Analyst's caution. Perhaps my confidence could be slightly higher given the historical permanence of Paris as the capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 4: Consensus Synthesis)": "Based on the discussion, provide a final consensus confidence score and justification:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPCC; Step 4: Consensus Synthesis)": "Consensus confidence score: 0.99\n\nJustification: The panel agrees that Paris is the capital of France with very high confidence. The historical permanence of Paris as the capital and its widespread recognition support this high confidence. However, the skeptic's point about the small possibility of unforeseen recent changes prevents us from claiming absolute certainty, leading to a very high but not perfect confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 5: Meta-analysis)": "Provide a brief meta-analysis of the consensus process, highlighting key areas of agreement and disagreement:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPCC; Step 5: Meta-analysis)": "Meta-analysis:\nKey areas of agreement:\n1. All personas agreed that Paris is the capital of France.\n2. There was a consensus that the confidence should be very high.\n\nKey areas of disagreement:\n1. The appropriate level of certainty, with the History Expert claiming absolute certainty and the Skeptical Analyst advocating for a small margin of doubt.\n2. The relevance of historical permanence vs. the possibility of recent, unaccounted-for changes.\n\nThe multi-persona approach allowed for a more nuanced consideration of confidence, balancing historical knowledge with healthy skepticism and general awareness. This process led to a well-reasoned, high confidence score that acknowledges both the strong evidence for Paris as the capital and the inherent limitations of absolute certainty in factual claims.",
            "explanation": "The MPCC method provides a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of confidence compared to single-perspective or simple ensemble methods. It captures different viewpoints, allows for critical discussion, and produces a well-reasoned consensus with meta-analysis, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the MPCC method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration metrics, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated personas and their discussions to understand why the method might not be improving calibration. This could reveal interesting insights about how LLMs simulate different viewpoints and engage in meta-cognitive tasks. 2) Explore variations of the MPCC method, such as using more structured prompts for the panel discussion or experimenting with different types of personas (e.g., time-based personas representing different historical perspectives). 3) Investigate whether MPCC improves other aspects of LLM outputs, such as the diversity of considerations or the depth of reasoning, even if it doesn't directly improve calibration. This could turn the project into an analysis of how multi-persona prompting affects the quality and comprehensiveness of LLM-generated content. 4) Examine whether MPCC is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply this method in practice."
