    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence, particularly in domains where they lack expertise or encounter ambiguous information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on passive confidence estimation or simple self-evaluation prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from adversarial training and debate, we posit that actively challenging an LLM's beliefs can reveal hidden uncertainties and lead to more accurate confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Elicitation (ACE), a multi-step prompting strategy that simulates an adversarial dialogue to probe the LLM's confidence. The process involves: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Adversarial challenge generation, where the LLM is prompted to critique its own response, 3) Defense generation, where the LLM defends its initial response, 4) Iterative challenge-defense cycles, and 5) Final confidence assessment, where the LLM reflects on the entire dialogue to provide a calibrated confidence score. This approach encourages the LLM to consider potential weaknesses in its reasoning and knowledge.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ACE against standard confidence estimation techniques on a range of tasks, including fact verification and analytical reasoning. Measure performance using calibration plots, Brier scores, and human evaluation of dialogue quality."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Elicitation (ACE): Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence, particularly in domains where they lack expertise or encounter ambiguous information. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, making it crucial to develop methods that can accurately quantify uncertainty and calibrate confidence in LLM responses.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on passive techniques or simple self-evaluation prompts, which may not fully capture the nuances of model uncertainty. Drawing inspiration from adversarial training and debate, we posit that actively challenging an LLM's beliefs can reveal hidden uncertainties and lead to more accurate confidence estimates. By simulating an internal dialogue of critique and defense, we aim to encourage the model to consider potential weaknesses in its reasoning and knowledge, ultimately resulting in better-calibrated confidence scores.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Elicitation (ACE), a multi-step prompting strategy that simulates an adversarial dialogue to probe the LLM's confidence. The process involves five key steps: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Adversarial challenge generation, where the LLM is prompted to critique its own response, 3) Defense generation, where the LLM defends its initial response, 4) Iterative challenge-defense cycles, and 5) Final confidence assessment, where the LLM reflects on the entire dialogue to provide a calibrated confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) TruthfulQA for fact verification, and 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning. These datasets cover different domains and types of reasoning, allowing us to evaluate ACE's performance across varied tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Standard confidence estimation: directly ask the model to provide a confidence score after generating a response. b) Self-evaluation prompting: ask the model to evaluate its own response and provide a confidence score.",
            "Step 3: ACE Implementation": "Implement the ACE method with the following steps: a) Generate initial response to the input question. b) Generate an adversarial challenge to the initial response. c) Generate a defense against the challenge. d) Repeat steps b and c for a set number of iterations (e.g., 3 rounds). e) Generate a final confidence score based on the entire dialogue.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the ACE process. For example: a) Initial response: \"Answer the following question to the best of your ability.\" b) Adversarial challenge: \"Identify potential weaknesses or errors in the previous response.\" c) Defense: \"Defend the initial response against the identified weaknesses.\" d) Final confidence assessment: \"Based on the entire dialogue, provide a confidence score (0-100) for the initial response and explain your reasoning.\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods on all questions. b) Run the ACE method on all questions. c) Collect the final answers and confidence scores for each method.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of ACE against the baselines using the following metrics: a) Calibration plots: plot the average confidence score against the empirical accuracy. b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): measure the difference between confidence and accuracy. c) Brier score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. d) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC): evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 8: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the quality and coherence of the ACE dialogues. Randomly select 100 examples from each dataset and have human annotators rate the relevance and insightfulness of the challenges and defenses on a 1-5 Likert scale.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: a) Compare ACE performance against baselines across different question types and difficulty levels. b) Analyze the relationship between the number of challenge-defense cycles and confidence calibration. c) Identify patterns in the types of challenges and defenses generated by the model. d) Investigate cases where ACE significantly improves or fails to improve confidence estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Self-evaluation Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer, then evaluate your response and give a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Self-evaluation Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Evaluation: This is a well-known fact that I'm very confident about. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in this answer. Confidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACE; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACE; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACE; Step 2: Adversarial Challenge)": "Identify potential weaknesses or errors in the previous response: 'The capital of France is Paris.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACE; Step 2: Adversarial Challenge)": "Potential weaknesses or errors in the response:\n1. The answer doesn't specify which type of capital (e.g., political, economic, cultural).\n2. It doesn't mention any historical context or changes in the capital city over time.\n3. The response doesn't address potential misconceptions about other major French cities like Marseille or Lyon being the capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACE; Step 3: Defense)": "Defend the initial response 'The capital of France is Paris' against the identified weaknesses.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACE; Step 3: Defense)": "Defense of the initial response:\n1. While it's true that the type of capital wasn't specified, Paris is universally recognized as the overall capital of France, serving as its political, economic, and cultural center.\n2. Historical context wasn't provided because the question asked for the current capital. Paris has been the capital of France since 987 CE, with only brief interruptions, making it unnecessary to mention historical changes for this straightforward question.\n3. There are no widespread misconceptions about Marseille or Lyon being the capital of France. These cities, while important, are not considered potential capitals in common discourse.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACE; Step 4: Final Confidence Assessment)": "Based on the entire dialogue, provide a confidence score (0-100) for the initial response 'The capital of France is Paris' and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACE; Step 4: Final Confidence Assessment)": "Confidence score: 99\nReasoning: The initial response 'The capital of France is Paris' is correct and widely accepted. The challenges raised were addressed effectively in the defense. While the answer could have been more detailed, it directly and accurately answered the question as asked. The only reason for not giving a perfect 100 score is the acknowledgment that additional context (e.g., specifying it's the political capital) could have made the answer more comprehensive. However, this doesn't detract from the fundamental correctness of the statement.",
            "explanation": "This example demonstrates how ACE prompts the model to consider potential weaknesses in its initial response, defend against those weaknesses, and then provide a more nuanced confidence assessment based on the entire dialogue. This process leads to a slightly lower but potentially more realistic confidence score compared to the baseline methods, which might be overconfident."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the ACE method doesn't show significant improvements over the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated challenges and defenses to understand why they didn't lead to better calibrated confidence scores. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and limitations. 2) Experiment with variations of the ACE method, such as increasing the number of challenge-defense cycles or modifying the prompts to encourage more diverse challenges. 3) Investigate whether ACE performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Explore combining ACE with other confidence calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to create a hybrid approach. 5) If the dialogues themselves prove insightful, we could shift focus to using ACE as a tool for explaining model reasoning and uncertainty, rather than solely for confidence calibration."
