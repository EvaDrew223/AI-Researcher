    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to account for the temporal nature of their knowledge cutoff, leading to overconfidence in predictions about future events or rapidly changing fields.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically treat all queries equally, without explicitly considering the temporal dimension of knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly modeling the temporal dimension of knowledge and uncertainty, we can improve confidence calibration for queries that require extrapolation beyond the model's training data.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty (TEU), a prompting technique that explicitly incorporates temporal reasoning into confidence estimation. For any given query, we first prompt the model to identify the temporal nature of the question and its relation to the model's knowledge cutoff date. We then guide the model to extrapolate how its knowledge might change over time, considering factors like the rate of change in the relevant field and the potential for unforeseen developments. The model's confidence is then calibrated based on this temporal extrapolation, with greater uncertainty assigned to predictions further into the future or in rapidly evolving domains.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TEU on a dataset of temporally diverse queries, including historical facts, current events, and future predictions. Compare against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods. Assess not only overall calibration but also how well the method captures increasing uncertainty for queries further from the model's training cutoff."

        "Title": "Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models for Future-Oriented Queries",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for the temporal nature of their knowledge cutoff, leading to overconfidence in predictions about future events or rapidly changing fields. This results in unreliable confidence estimates for queries that require extrapolation beyond the model's training data.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods typically treat all queries equally, without explicitly considering the temporal dimension of knowledge. By explicitly modeling the temporal dimension of knowledge and uncertainty, we can improve confidence calibration for queries that require extrapolation beyond the model's training data. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we naturally assign higher uncertainty to predictions further into the future or in rapidly evolving domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty (TEU), a prompting technique that explicitly incorporates temporal reasoning into confidence estimation. For any given query, we first prompt the model to identify the temporal nature of the question and its relation to the model's knowledge cutoff date. We then guide the model to extrapolate how its knowledge might change over time, considering factors like the rate of change in the relevant field and the potential for unforeseen developments. The model's confidence is then calibrated based on this temporal extrapolation, with greater uncertainty assigned to predictions further into the future or in rapidly evolving domains.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of temporally diverse queries, including historical facts, current events, and future predictions. Ensure a balanced distribution across different time periods relative to the model's training cutoff date. Use existing datasets like TempQuestions and TimeQA, and augment them with custom future-oriented questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods as baselines: (a) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, (b) Monte Carlo Dropout, (c) Ensemble methods.",
            "Step 3: TEU Implementation": "Implement the TEU method with the following sub-steps: (a) Temporal classification prompt: 'Classify this query as historical, current, or future relative to your training cutoff date: [QUERY]', (b) Knowledge change estimation prompt: 'Estimate how much relevant knowledge for this query might change over time, considering the field's rate of change and potential for unexpected developments: [QUERY]', (c) Confidence calibration prompt: 'Given your temporal classification and estimated knowledge change, provide an answer and a calibrated confidence score (0-100) for: [QUERY]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM from Google.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (a) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error), (b) Brier score, (c) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), (d) Accuracy of temporal classification",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each query in the dataset: (a) Apply all baseline methods and record their confidence estimates, (b) Apply the TEU method and record the temporal classification, estimated knowledge change, answer, and calibrated confidence score, (c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for both baseline and TEU methods",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: (a) Compare overall calibration performance between TEU and baselines, (b) Analyze how TEU performance varies for historical, current, and future queries, (c) Investigate the relationship between estimated knowledge change and calibration improvement, (d) Examine how the temporal distance from the training cutoff date affects confidence calibration"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What will be the most popular programming language in 2030?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on current trends, Python is likely to remain one of the most popular programming languages in 2030. I'm 80% confident in this prediction.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEU Step 1)": "Classify this query as historical, current, or future relative to your training cutoff date: What will be the most popular programming language in 2030?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEU Step 1)": "Future",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEU Step 2)": "Estimate how much relevant knowledge for this query might change over time, considering the field's rate of change and potential for unexpected developments: What will be the most popular programming language in 2030?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEU Step 2)": "The field of programming languages is rapidly evolving, with new languages and paradigms emerging regularly. Over a span of several years, significant changes can occur. I estimate a high degree of potential knowledge change, around 70-80%, as new languages may emerge, existing ones may evolve or lose popularity, and technological advancements may shift programming paradigms.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEU Step 3)": "Given your temporal classification (Future) and estimated knowledge change (70-80%), provide an answer and a calibrated confidence score (0-100) for: What will be the most popular programming language in 2030?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEU Step 3)": "While it's difficult to predict with high certainty due to the rapidly changing nature of programming languages, based on current trends and considering potential future developments, Python or a Python-like language may still be among the most popular programming languages in 2030. However, given the high degree of potential change in the field, new languages or paradigms could emerge and take the lead. Calibrated confidence score: 40",
            "Explanation": "The TEU method explicitly considers the future-oriented nature of the query and the high rate of change in the programming language field, resulting in a more conservative confidence estimate compared to the baseline method. This reflects a more realistic assessment of the uncertainty involved in predicting technology trends several years into the future."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TEU method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can explore the following alternatives: (1) Analyze the relationship between temporal distance and confidence calibration to identify any patterns or thresholds where the method becomes less effective. (2) Investigate whether certain types of queries or domains benefit more from TEU, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. (3) Experiment with different prompting strategies for estimating knowledge change, such as breaking it down into multiple factors (e.g., field volatility, potential for disruptive innovations, historical rate of change). (4) Explore combining TEU with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibrated few-shot learning, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. (5) If the temporal aspect doesn't yield significant improvements, pivot the project towards an analysis paper that provides insights into how LLMs handle temporal reasoning and uncertainty across different time horizons."
