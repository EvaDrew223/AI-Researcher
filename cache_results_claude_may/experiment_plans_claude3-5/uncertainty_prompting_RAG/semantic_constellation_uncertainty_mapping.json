        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to express uncertainty in a way that captures the complex, multidimensional nature of their knowledge and reasoning processes.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically produce scalar confidence values or simple categorical uncertainty estimates, which may not fully represent the nuanced structure of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By mapping uncertainty onto a rich semantic space, we can potentially capture more complex patterns of uncertainty that better reflect the true state of the model's knowledge and reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Constellation Uncertainty Mapping (SCUM), a technique that prompts the LLM to express its uncertainty as a constellation of interconnected semantic points. For a given query, the model is asked to generate multiple 'uncertainty points', each representing a specific aspect or dimension of its uncertainty (e.g., factual recall, logical reasoning, contextual relevance). These points are then prompted to be positioned in a high-dimensional semantic space, with their relative distances and connections representing the relationships between different aspects of uncertainty. The model is also asked to provide a brief description for each point and its connections. This approach results in a rich, structured representation of uncertainty that can capture complex patterns and interdependencies.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SCUM on a diverse set of tasks, including multi-step reasoning problems, open-ended generation tasks, and interdisciplinary queries. We'll compare the performance of SCUM against traditional scalar and categorical uncertainty estimates, assessing not only overall calibration but also the ability to capture nuanced, multidimensional uncertainties. We'll develop visualization techniques to represent these semantic constellations and investigate how they evolve across different types of queries and domains. Additionally, we'll explore how these uncertainty constellations can be used to guide further querying or information gathering processes."

        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to express uncertainty in a way that captures the complex, multidimensional nature of their knowledge and reasoning processes. Current approaches typically produce scalar confidence values or simple categorical uncertainty estimates, which may not fully represent the nuanced structure of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By mapping uncertainty onto a rich semantic space, we can potentially capture more complex patterns of uncertainty that better reflect the true state of the model's knowledge and reasoning. This approach could provide a more comprehensive and interpretable representation of model uncertainty, which is crucial for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in various applications.",

The model is also asked to provide a brief description for each point and its connections.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks including: (1) Multi-step reasoning problems from the GSM8K dataset, (2) Open-ended generation tasks from the HumanEval dataset, and (3) Interdisciplinary queries from the MMLU dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: (1) Direct scalar confidence estimation: Prompt the model to output a single confidence score. (2) Categorical uncertainty estimation: Prompt the model to classify its uncertainty into predefined categories (e.g., 'very certain', 'somewhat certain', 'uncertain').",
            "Step 3: SCUM Implementation": "Implement the SCUM method with the following steps: (1) Generate initial response, (2) Generate uncertainty points, (3) Position points in semantic space, (4) Describe connections between points.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of SCUM. For example: 'Generate 5 uncertainty points that represent different aspects of your uncertainty in answering this question.' 'Position these uncertainty points in a semantic space, where distance represents similarity of uncertainty types.' 'Describe the connections between these uncertainty points.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Calibration error: Compare model's expressed uncertainty with actual performance. (2) Uncertainty dimensionality: Measure the number and diversity of uncertainty points generated. (3) Human evaluation: Assess the interpretability and usefulness of the uncertainty constellations.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and SCUM. Collect results including model outputs, uncertainty estimates, and evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare SCUM performance against baselines. Analyze how uncertainty constellations vary across different types of queries and domains. Investigate correlations between constellation properties and task performance.",
            "Step 9: Visualization": "Develop visualization techniques to represent the semantic constellations, potentially using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP for 2D or 3D visualizations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Scalar Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Scalar Confidence)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Categorical Uncertainty)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please classify your certainty as 'very certain', 'somewhat certain', or 'uncertain'.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Categorical Uncertainty)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Certainty: Very certain",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SCUM)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please generate 5 uncertainty points that represent different aspects of your uncertainty in answering this question. Then, position these uncertainty points in a semantic space, where distance represents similarity of uncertainty types. Finally, describe the connections between these uncertainty points.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SCUM)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nUncertainty points:\n1. Factual recall (very low uncertainty)\n2. Historical changes (low uncertainty)\n3. Alternative capitals (medium uncertainty)\n4. Definition of 'capital' (low uncertainty)\n5. Current geopolitical status (very low uncertainty)\n\nSemantic space positioning:\n[Factual recall] ---- [Current geopolitical status]\n    |                    |\n    |                    |\n[Definition of 'capital'] |  \n    |                    |\n    |                    |\n[Historical changes] -- [Alternative capitals]\n\nConnections:\n- Factual recall and current geopolitical status are closely related and both have very low uncertainty, as Paris is widely known and recognized as the current capital.\n- Definition of 'capital' is connected to both factual recall and current geopolitical status, as it affects how we interpret the question.\n- Historical changes and alternative capitals are more distant from the others, representing slightly higher uncertainty about past changes or potential alternatives.\n- Historical changes and alternative capitals are connected, as past changes could have led to different cities being capitals.",
            "Explanation": "SCUM provides a richer, more nuanced representation of the model's uncertainty compared to scalar or categorical estimates. It captures multiple dimensions of uncertainty and their relationships, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the model's confidence and potential areas of doubt."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SCUM does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate whether the uncertainty points generated are truly diverse and relevant, or if they tend to be repetitive or irrelevant. We could also analyze whether the positioning in semantic space adds meaningful information, or if it's largely arbitrary. Additionally, we could explore whether certain types of tasks or domains benefit more from SCUM than others, potentially leading to insights about when multidimensional uncertainty representation is most useful. If the method proves too complex for practical use, we could explore simplified versions that retain some of the multidimensional aspects while being more easily interpretable or computationally efficient. Finally, we could investigate how SCUM outputs could be used to guide further querying or information gathering processes, potentially turning this into a study on active learning or query refinement strategies."
