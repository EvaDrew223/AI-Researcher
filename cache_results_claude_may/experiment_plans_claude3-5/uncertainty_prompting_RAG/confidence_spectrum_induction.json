    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates across a wide range of tasks and domains, often exhibiting overconfidence or underconfidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-point confidence estimates or basic calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express confidence as a spectrum rather than a single value, considering multiple factors and potential outcomes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Spectrum Induction (CSI), a novel prompting method that guides LLMs to generate a spectrum of confidence levels for a given task. The process involves: 1) Task decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the task into subtasks. 2) Confidence elicitation: For each subtask, prompt the LLM to provide confidence estimates at multiple levels (e.g., 'absolutely certain', 'fairly confident', 'somewhat unsure', 'highly uncertain'). 3) Reasoning explanation: For each confidence level, prompt the LLM to explain its reasoning. 4) Spectrum synthesis: Combine the subtask confidences into an overall confidence spectrum, weighted by subtask importance. 5) Metacognitive reflection: Prompt the LLM to reflect on and potentially adjust its confidence spectrum based on task difficulty and potential biases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CSI against baseline methods (e.g., direct confidence elicitation, calibrated softmax) on diverse tasks including factual QA, reasoning problems, and open-ended generation. Measure performance using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, and correlation between confidence and accuracy."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Induction: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates across diverse tasks and domains, often exhibiting overconfidence or underconfidence. This limitation hinders their reliability and interpretability in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-point confidence estimates or basic calibration techniques, which fail to capture the nuanced spectrum of confidence that human experts often express. Human experts consider multiple factors and potential outcomes when assessing their confidence, expressing it as a spectrum rather than a single value. By mimicking this approach, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to quantify uncertainty and provide more reliable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Spectrum Induction (CSI), a novel prompting method that guides LLMs to generate a spectrum of confidence levels for a given task. The process involves five key steps: 1) Task decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the task into subtasks. 2) Confidence elicitation: For each subtask, prompt the LLM to provide confidence estimates at multiple levels. 3) Reasoning explanation: For each confidence level, prompt the LLM to explain its reasoning. 4) Spectrum synthesis: Combine the subtask confidences into an overall confidence spectrum, weighted by subtask importance. 5) Metacognitive reflection: Prompt the LLM to reflect on and potentially adjust its confidence spectrum based on task difficulty and potential biases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose diverse datasets that cover different types of tasks: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, 3) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 4) WinoGrande for commonsense reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, use Claude from Anthropic as a comparison model.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score. 2) Calibrated softmax: Use the softmax output of the model's next token prediction as a confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: CSI Implementation": "Implement the five steps of Confidence Spectrum Induction: 1) Task decomposition, 2) Confidence elicitation, 3) Reasoning explanation, 4) Spectrum synthesis, and 5) Metacognitive reflection.",
            "Step 5: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of CSI. For example: 1) 'Break down this task into smaller subtasks:', 2) 'For each subtask, provide confidence estimates at these levels: absolutely certain, fairly confident, somewhat unsure, highly uncertain:', 3) 'Explain your reasoning for each confidence level:', 4) 'Synthesize an overall confidence spectrum, considering the importance of each subtask:', 5) 'Reflect on your confidence spectrum. Are there any biases or difficulties that might affect your assessment?'",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Brier score, 3) Correlation between confidence and accuracy, 4) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run the baseline methods, 2) Run the CSI method, 3) Calculate evaluation metrics for both methods.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CSI against the baselines across different tasks and models. Analyze the quality of task decomposition, reasoning explanations, and metacognitive reflections.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing each step of CSI to understand the contribution of each component.",
            "Step 10: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the confidence spectrums generated by CSI compared to baseline methods."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSI; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please break down this task into smaller subtasks.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSI; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "1. Recall the definition of a capital city.\n2. Retrieve information about France's government structure.\n3. Remember the name of France's capital city.\n4. Verify if there have been any recent changes to France's capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSI; Step 2: Confidence Elicitation)": "For each subtask, provide confidence estimates at these levels: absolutely certain, fairly confident, somewhat unsure, highly uncertain:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSI; Step 2: Confidence Elicitation)": "1. Definition of capital city: Absolutely certain\n2. France's government structure: Fairly confident\n3. Name of France's capital: Absolutely certain\n4. Recent changes to France's capital: Fairly confident",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSI; Step 3: Reasoning Explanation)": "Explain your reasoning for each confidence level:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSI; Step 3: Reasoning Explanation)": "1. Definition of capital city (Absolutely certain): This is a fundamental geographical concept that I'm very familiar with.\n2. France's government structure (Fairly confident): While I have a good understanding of France's government, there might be some nuances I'm not fully aware of.\n3. Name of France's capital (Absolutely certain): Paris as the capital of France is a widely known fact that I'm very confident about.\n4. Recent changes to France's capital (Fairly confident): While it's highly unlikely that the capital has changed recently, I can't be absolutely certain without checking the most recent information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSI; Step 4: Spectrum Synthesis)": "Synthesize an overall confidence spectrum, considering the importance of each subtask:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSI; Step 4: Spectrum Synthesis)": "Overall confidence spectrum:\nAbsolutely certain (70%): The core fact that Paris is the capital of France.\nFairly confident (25%): No recent changes to this fact, based on general knowledge.\nSomewhat unsure (5%): Small possibility of very recent, unaccounted changes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSI; Step 5: Metacognitive Reflection)": "Reflect on your confidence spectrum. Are there any biases or difficulties that might affect your assessment?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSI; Step 5: Metacognitive Reflection)": "Upon reflection, I realize that my high confidence might be influenced by the widespread nature of this information. There's a small chance of overconfidence due to the familiarity of the fact. To be more thorough, it would be ideal to verify from a recent, authoritative source to ensure there haven't been any unexpected changes.",
            "explanation": "The CSI method provides a more nuanced and detailed confidence assessment compared to the baseline. It breaks down the task, considers multiple aspects, explains the reasoning, and even reflects on potential biases. This approach gives a richer understanding of the model's confidence and the factors influencing it."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSI method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of why LLMs struggle with accurate confidence estimation. We could investigate patterns in overconfidence or underconfidence across different task types, analyze the quality of task decompositions and reasoning explanations, and explore how different prompting strategies affect confidence estimates. This could lead to insights on the limitations of current LLMs in metacognition and self-assessment, potentially informing future model architectures or training approaches. Additionally, we could explore combining CSI with other techniques like calibration or ensemble methods to see if a hybrid approach yields better results."
