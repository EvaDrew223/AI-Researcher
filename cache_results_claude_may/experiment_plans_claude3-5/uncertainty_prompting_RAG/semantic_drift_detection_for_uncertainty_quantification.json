        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods often fail to capture subtle shifts in semantic understanding that can indicate underlying uncertainty in language models.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence scores or probability distributions over possible outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By detecting and quantifying semantic drift in model outputs across related prompts, we can potentially uncover hidden uncertainties and improve the overall calibration of confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a semantic drift detection technique for uncertainty quantification. This method involves generating a series of semantically related prompts that gradually shift the context or focus of the original query. We then analyze the semantic consistency of the model's outputs across this prompt series using advanced natural language processing techniques. We propose a novel Semantic Consistency Score (SCS) that quantifies the degree of semantic drift in the model's responses. Large semantic drifts for small changes in input are interpreted as indicators of high uncertainty. We use this score to adjust and refine the model's explicit confidence estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on tasks that require nuanced semantic understanding, such as paraphrase detection, textual entailment, and abstract reasoning questions. We'll compare our semantic drift-based uncertainty estimates with traditional confidence scoring methods, using metrics like calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human judgments of model uncertainty."

        "Title": "Semantic Drift Detection for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often fail to capture subtle shifts in semantic understanding that can indicate underlying uncertainty. This limitation can lead to overconfident or miscalibrated model outputs, potentially resulting in unreliable or misleading information in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence scores or probability distributions over possible outputs, which may not fully capture the nuanced uncertainties in language models' semantic understanding. By detecting and quantifying semantic drift in model outputs across related prompts, we can potentially uncover hidden uncertainties and improve the overall calibration of confidence estimates. This method is inspired by the observation that human uncertainty often manifests as inconsistency or drift in explanations when asked similar questions, and we aim to replicate this phenomenon in language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a semantic drift detection technique for uncertainty quantification. This method involves generating a series of semantically related prompts that gradually shift the context or focus of the original query. We then analyze the semantic consistency of the model's outputs across this prompt series using advanced natural language processing techniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Semantic Consistency Score (SCS) that quantifies the degree of semantic drift in the model's responses. Large semantic drifts for small changes in input are interpreted as indicators of high uncertainty. We use this score to adjust and refine the model's explicit confidence estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that require nuanced semantic understanding: (a) Paraphrase detection: Quora Question Pairs, (b) Textual entailment: SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference), (c) Abstract reasoning: PARARULE Plus dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Setup": "Implement traditional confidence scoring methods: (a) Softmax probabilities, (b) Monte Carlo Dropout, (c) Ensemble methods.",
            "Step 3: Semantic Drift Detection Implementation": "a. Prompt Series Generation: For each input, create a series of 5 semantically related prompts using GPT-4. Example: Original: 'Is climate change real?' Related: 'What evidence supports global warming?', 'How do greenhouse gases affect Earth's temperature?', etc. b. Model Response Collection: Use GPT-3.5-turbo to generate responses for each prompt in the series. c. Semantic Embedding: Use a pre-trained Sentence-BERT model to create embeddings for each response. d. Semantic Consistency Score (SCS) Calculation: Compute the average cosine similarity between the embedding of the original response and the embeddings of the related responses. SCS = 1 - average_similarity, so higher SCS indicates more drift.",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Estimation": "a. Generate the model's explicit confidence score using traditional methods. b. Adjust the confidence score based on the SCS: adjusted_confidence = original_confidence * (1 - SCS * \u03b1), where \u03b1 is a hyperparameter to be tuned.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "a. Calibration Error: Compute Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for both baseline and adjusted confidence scores. b. Brier Score: Calculate Brier scores for both methods. c. Correlation with Human Judgments: Collect human judgments of model uncertainty for a subset of examples and compute correlation with both baseline and adjusted confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a. Compare the performance of the baseline methods and the semantic drift-adjusted method across different tasks and datasets. b. Analyze cases where semantic drift detection significantly improves or worsens uncertainty estimation. c. Investigate the relationship between semantic drift and task difficulty or ambiguity."

            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Question: Are bats blind? Context: Bats are nocturnal creatures known for their echolocation abilities.",
                "Output": "Answer: No, bats are not blind. While many people believe that bats are blind, this is actually a common misconception. Bats have eyes and are capable of sight. However, their vision is generally adapted for low-light conditions, as most bat species are nocturnal. Their eyesight is often not as crucial for navigation as their highly developed echolocation abilities, which allow them to navigate and hunt in darkness by emitting high-frequency sounds and interpreting the echoes. This might have contributed to the myth that bats are blind. Different bat species have varying levels of visual acuity, with some having better eyesight than others, but none are truly blind. Confidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score (0.95) based on the model's internal probability estimates, but it doesn't account for potential semantic uncertainties or nuances in the question."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Input": "Original Question: Are bats blind? Context: Bats are nocturnal creatures known for their echolocation abilities. Related Questions: 1. How well can bats see in daylight? 2. Do all bat species have the same level of vision? 3. How does bat vision compare to human vision? 4. Can bats navigate without using echolocation? 5. What role does vision play in bat behavior?",
                "Output": "Original Answer: Bats are not blind, but their vision is generally adapted for low-light conditions. Most species rely more on echolocation for navigation and hunting. Confidence: 0.95 Related Answers: 1. Bats can see in daylight, but their vision is not optimized for bright conditions. 2. Vision capabilities vary among bat species, with some having better eyesight than others. 3. Bat vision is generally less acute than human vision, especially in daylight. 4. Some bats can navigate using vision alone, but most rely heavily on echolocation. 5. Vision plays a role in long-distance navigation and avoiding predators for many bat species. Semantic Consistency Score: 0.3 Adjusted Confidence: 0.665",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method generates related questions and analyzes the semantic consistency of the answers. The Semantic Consistency Score of 0.3 indicates some drift in the responses, suggesting underlying uncertainty. This leads to an adjusted confidence score of 0.665, which is lower and potentially more accurate than the original high confidence of 0.95."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed semantic drift detection method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring the relationship between semantic drift and model uncertainty. We would conduct a detailed investigation into cases where semantic drift occurs, analyzing factors such as question complexity, domain specificity, and the model's training data. We could also explore alternative measures of semantic consistency, such as using different embedding techniques or incorporating attention weights from the model. Additionally, we might investigate how semantic drift varies across different model sizes and architectures, potentially uncovering insights into how model scale affects uncertainty in language understanding. This analysis could provide valuable insights for future work on uncertainty quantification in large language models."
