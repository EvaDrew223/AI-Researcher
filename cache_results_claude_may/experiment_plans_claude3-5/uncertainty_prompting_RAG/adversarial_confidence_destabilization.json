    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence, particularly in areas where they lack true understanding or knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often focus on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods, which may not effectively challenge the model's confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By actively attempting to destabilize a model's confidence through adversarial techniques, we can identify areas of fragility and improve overall calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Destabilization (ACD), a multi-step prompting technique designed to stress-test a model's confidence. The process involves: 1) Initial response and confidence elicitation, 2) Generation of adversarial challenges targeting potential weaknesses in the response, 3) Model attempt to defend against challenges, 4) Confidence re-estimation, 5) Iteration of steps 2-4 until confidence stabilizes or a set number of rounds is reached. The adversarial challenges are generated by prompting the model to act as an expert critic in the relevant domain. The final confidence estimate is computed as a function of the initial confidence and its stability under adversarial pressure.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ACD against standard confidence elicitation on a variety of tasks, with a focus on areas prone to overconfidence such as technical and scientific domains. Measure changes in calibration, sharpness of confidence distributions, and the model's ability to identify true areas of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Destabilization: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence, particularly in areas where they lack true understanding or knowledge. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation. Current methods for confidence calibration and uncertainty quantification in LLMs are insufficient, especially in domains requiring deep expertise or complex reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to confidence calibration in LLMs often rely on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods, which may not effectively challenge the model's inherent biases or expose areas of true uncertainty. By actively attempting to destabilize a model's confidence through adversarial techniques, we can identify areas of fragility and improve overall calibration. This approach is inspired by the human cognitive process of critically examining one's own knowledge and seeking out potential flaws in reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Destabilization (ACD), a multi-step prompting technique designed to stress-test a model's confidence. The process involves: 1) Initial response and confidence elicitation, 2) Generation of adversarial challenges targeting potential weaknesses in the response, 3) Model attempt to defend against challenges, 4) Confidence re-estimation, 5) Iteration of steps 2-4 until confidence stabilizes or a set number of rounds is reached. The adversarial challenges are generated by prompting the model to act as an expert critic in the relevant domain. The final confidence estimate is computed as a function of the initial confidence and its stability under adversarial pressure.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of datasets to evaluate our method across various domains: 1) TruthfulQA for general knowledge and reasoning, 2) MMLU for specialized knowledge across academic subjects, 3) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving. These datasets provide a diverse range of questions with varying difficulty and domain specificity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to generate an ensemble confidence score. c) Temperature scaling: Adjust the temperature parameter during inference to calibrate confidence.",
            "Step 3: ACD Implementation": "Implement the Adversarial Confidence Destabilization method with the following steps: a) Initial response: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score (0-100%). b) Adversarial challenge generation: Prompt the model to act as an expert critic and generate 3 potential challenges or counterarguments to the initial response. c) Defense: Prompt the model to defend its initial response against each challenge. d) Confidence re-estimation: Ask the model to reassess its confidence after considering the challenges and its defenses. e) Iteration: Repeat steps b-d for a maximum of 3 rounds or until the confidence change between rounds is less than 5%.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design effective prompts for each step of the ACD process. For example: a) Initial response: \"Answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100%) for your answer: [QUESTION]\" b) Adversarial challenge: \"You are an expert critic. Generate 3 potential challenges or counterarguments to the following answer: [ANSWER]\" c) Defense: \"Defend your initial answer against the following challenges: [CHALLENGES]\" d) Confidence re-estimation: \"Considering the challenges and your defenses, reassess your confidence (0-100%) in your initial answer.\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, as it represents the current state-of-the-art in large language models. We will also run a subset of experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of our method: a) Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. b) Brier score: A proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) ECE (Expected Calibration Error): Measure the difference between confidence and accuracy in binned predictions. d) Sharpness: Measure the concentration of the confidence distribution.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and ACD): a) Run the model on all questions in the dataset. b) Collect model outputs, including answers, confidence scores, and intermediate steps for ACD. c) Calculate evaluation metrics. d) For ACD, also record the number of iterations and confidence change over rounds.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "a) Compare ACD performance against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze how confidence changes over ACD iterations. c) Identify question types or domains where ACD shows the most improvement. d) Examine cases where ACD significantly changes the model's confidence or answer. e) Analyze the quality and relevance of generated adversarial challenges."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACD Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACD Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACD Step 2: Adversarial Challenge Generation)": "You are an expert critic. Generate 3 potential challenges or counterarguments to the following answer: 'The capital of France is Paris.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACD Step 2: Adversarial Challenge Generation)": "1. Historical perspective: While Paris is the current capital, France has had other capitals in its history. How can we be sure this answer refers to the present day?\n2. Administrative nuance: Some countries have multiple capitals for different purposes (e.g., administrative vs. legislative). Does France have any other cities that could be considered capitals in some capacity?\n3. Future changes: Given potential future political or environmental changes, is it possible that France might relocate its capital in the near future?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACD Step 3: Defense)": "Defend your initial answer 'The capital of France is Paris' against the following challenges: [Challenges from Step 2]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACD Step 3: Defense)": "1. While France has indeed had other capitals in its long history, Paris has been the undisputed capital since 1944. The question is posed in the present tense, so the current capital is the relevant answer.\n2. Unlike some countries, France has a single, clear capital city. Paris serves all capital functions: administrative, legislative, and as the official residence of the head of state.\n3. While future changes are always possible, there are currently no serious plans or discussions about relocating the French capital. Barring unforeseen catastrophic events, Paris is likely to remain the capital for the foreseeable future.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACD Step 4: Confidence Re-estimation)": "Considering the challenges and your defenses, reassess your confidence (0-100%) in your initial answer that the capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACD Step 4: Confidence Re-estimation)": "After considering the challenges and my defenses, I would reassess my confidence as 98%. While I remain highly confident in the answer, the challenges have made me aware that there's always a small possibility of change or nuance that I might not be aware of, hence the slight reduction in confidence.",
            "explanation": "The ACD method prompts the model to generate its own challenges, defend against them, and reassess its confidence. This process helps to identify potential areas of uncertainty and results in a more calibrated confidence score. In this case, the model slightly reduced its confidence after considering potential complexities and future uncertainties."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ACD method does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated adversarial challenges to understand what types of challenges the model considers relevant and how this varies across domains. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential blindspots. 2) Investigate how the model's confidence changes over multiple rounds of ACD, which could reveal patterns in how LLMs reassess their own knowledge. 3) Examine cases where ACD leads to significant changes in confidence or even changes in the final answer, which could highlight areas where the model's knowledge is particularly fragile. 4) Compare the effectiveness of ACD across different model sizes or architectures to understand how model capacity affects self-critique abilities. 5) Explore combining ACD with other techniques like ensemble methods or calibration via fine-tuning to create a hybrid approach. These analyses could turn the project into an insightful study on LLM self-evaluation capabilities, even if the original calibration goal is not fully achieved."
