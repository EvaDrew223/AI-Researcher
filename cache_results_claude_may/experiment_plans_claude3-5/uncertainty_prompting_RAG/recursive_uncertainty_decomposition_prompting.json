        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overconfident answers for complex queries without properly decomposing the problem and assessing uncertainty at each step.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods like Chain-of-Thought prompting focus on improving reasoning but don't explicitly address uncertainty quantification at each reasoning step.",

        "Proposed Method": "Implement a recursive prompting strategy: 1) Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the query into sub-questions. 2) Sub-question Evaluation: For each sub-question, prompt the model to provide an answer and uncertainty estimate. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: Prompt the model to combine sub-question uncertainties, considering their interdependencies. 4) Recursive Refinement: If uncertainty for any sub-question is high, repeat the process for that sub-question. 5) Final Synthesis: Prompt the model to provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate based on the recursive decomposition.",

        "Title": "Recursive Uncertainty Quantification: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overconfident answers for complex queries without properly decomposing the problem and assessing uncertainty at each step. This leads to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in high-stakes domains.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like Chain-of-Thought prompting focus on improving reasoning but don't explicitly address uncertainty quantification at each reasoning step. By recursively decomposing complex queries and assessing uncertainty at each sub-component, we can obtain more accurate and granular uncertainty estimates for the overall answer. This approach is inspired by human problem-solving strategies, where complex problems are broken down into smaller, more manageable parts, with uncertainty assessed at each stage.",
        "Proposed Method": "We implement a recursive prompting strategy called Recursive Uncertainty Quantification (RUQ): 1) Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the query into sub-questions. 2) Sub-question Evaluation: For each sub-question, prompt the model to provide an answer and uncertainty estimate. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: Prompt the model to combine sub-question uncertainties, considering their interdependencies. 4) Recursive Refinement: If uncertainty for any sub-question is high, repeat the process for that sub-question. 5) Final Synthesis: Prompt the model to provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate based on the recursive decomposition.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-hop reasoning datasets such as HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. These datasets contain complex questions that require multiple steps of reasoning, making them suitable for our recursive approach.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting as baselines. For standard prompting, directly ask the question. For CoT, use the prompt 'Let's approach this step by step:' before the question.",
            "Step 3: RUQ Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Uncertainty Quantification method with the following steps:\na) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down this question into smaller sub-questions:'\nb) Sub-question evaluation prompt: 'Answer this sub-question and provide an uncertainty estimate (0-100%):'\nc) Uncertainty propagation prompt: 'Given these sub-question answers and uncertainties, combine them to estimate the overall uncertainty:'\nd) Recursive refinement prompt: 'This sub-question has high uncertainty. Let's break it down further:'\ne) Final synthesis prompt: 'Based on all the sub-questions and their uncertainties, provide a final answer and overall uncertainty estimate:'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics:\na) Answer Accuracy: Percentage of correct final answers\nb) Calibration Error: Measure of how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy\nc) Uncertainty Resolution: How well uncertainty decreases through recursive refinement\nd) Decomposition Quality: Human evaluation of the relevance and completeness of sub-questions",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets:\na) Apply standard prompting, CoT prompting, and RUQ\nb) Record the final answers, uncertainty estimates, and intermediate steps\nc) Calculate the evaluation metrics",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of RUQ against the baselines:\na) Analyze how RUQ improves calibration and uncertainty estimation\nb) Examine cases where RUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines\nc) Investigate the relationship between decomposition quality and final answer accuracy/uncertainty"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Who was the maternal grandfather of the person who founded the city that hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The maternal grandfather of the person who founded the city that hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics was James Woodruff. Atlanta hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics, and it was founded by John Thrasher. John Thrasher's maternal grandfather was James Woodruff.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Who was the maternal grandfather of the person who founded the city that hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics? Let's approach this step by step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Let's break this down step by step:\n1. First, we need to identify which city hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n   - The 1996 Summer Olympics were held in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out who founded Atlanta.\n   - Atlanta was founded by John Thrasher in 1837.\n\n3. Now, we need to identify John Thrasher's mother.\n   - After researching, I couldn't find definitive information about John Thrasher's mother.\n\n4. Finally, we would need to identify the father of John Thrasher's mother.\n   - Since we don't have information about John Thrasher's mother, we can't determine his maternal grandfather.\n\nTherefore, I don't have enough information to accurately answer who the maternal grandfather of the person who founded Atlanta was. The question requires specific genealogical information about John Thrasher that isn't readily available.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUQ; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Break down this question into smaller sub-questions: Who was the maternal grandfather of the person who founded the city that hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUQ; Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. Which city hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics?\n2. Who founded this city?\n3. Who was the mother of the city's founder?\n4. Who was the father of the founder's mother?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUQ; Step 2: Sub-question Evaluation)": "Answer this sub-question and provide an uncertainty estimate (0-100%): Which city hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUQ; Step 2: Sub-question Evaluation)": "Answer: Atlanta, Georgia hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nUncertainty: 5%\nExplanation: This is a well-known historical fact that can be easily verified.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUQ; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Given these sub-question answers and uncertainties, combine them to estimate the overall uncertainty:\n1. Atlanta hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics (5% uncertainty)\n2. John Thrasher founded Atlanta (20% uncertainty)\n3. Unable to find information about John Thrasher's mother (90% uncertainty)\n4. Unable to find information about John Thrasher's maternal grandfather (95% uncertainty)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUQ; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Overall uncertainty: 95%\nExplanation: The overall uncertainty is very high because we lack crucial information about John Thrasher's family history. While we're fairly certain about the 1996 Olympics location and Atlanta's founder, the key pieces of information about Thrasher's mother and grandfather are missing. In a chain of reasoning, the overall uncertainty is generally as high as the most uncertain critical component.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUQ; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on all the sub-questions and their uncertainties, provide a final answer and overall uncertainty estimate for the question: Who was the maternal grandfather of the person who founded the city that hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUQ; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Based on the available information, we cannot determine the maternal grandfather of the person who founded the city that hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nExplanation:\n1. We know with high certainty that Atlanta hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n2. We are fairly confident that John Thrasher founded Atlanta in 1837.\n3. However, we lack reliable information about John Thrasher's mother.\n4. Consequently, we also lack information about John Thrasher's maternal grandfather.\n\nOverall Uncertainty: 95%\n\nThe high uncertainty stems from the lack of genealogical information about John Thrasher's family. While we can confidently answer parts of the question, the critical information needed to identify his maternal grandfather is missing, leading to a very high overall uncertainty in the final answer.",
            "explanation": "The RUQ method provides a more nuanced and transparent answer compared to the baselines. It breaks down the problem, assesses uncertainty at each step, and provides a final answer with a well-justified uncertainty estimate. This approach helps prevent overconfident incorrect answers and clearly communicates the limits of the model's knowledge."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RUQ method doesn't significantly improve over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine: 1) The quality of decompositions - are they relevant and complete? 2) The accuracy of sub-question answers - is the model struggling with certain types of sub-questions? 3) The uncertainty estimation process - is the model calibrated well for individual sub-questions? 4) The uncertainty propagation step - is the model combining uncertainties logically? This analysis could lead to insights about LLM reasoning and uncertainty estimation, potentially informing new prompting strategies or revealing limitations in current LLM capabilities. We could also explore variations of the RUQ method, such as using different decomposition strategies or alternative uncertainty combination methods, to see if these yield better results."
