        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overconfident responses, especially when they lack crucial information or when the query is ambiguous.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically ask for direct confidence estimates or use ensemble techniques to gauge uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly contrasting a model's knowledge against what it doesn't know, we may be able to elicit more accurate confidence estimates and highlight knowledge gaps.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Confidence Elicitation (CCE), a prompting technique that explicitly probes the model's knowledge boundaries. The method involves: 1) Asking the original query, 2) Prompting the model to list key pieces of information it would need to be more certain, 3) For each piece of missing information, asking the model how its confidence would change if it had that information, 4) Prompting the model to contrast its current knowledge against these hypothetical scenarios, 5) Eliciting a final confidence estimate based on this contrastive analysis. This approach encourages the model to explicitly reason about its knowledge gaps and how they affect its confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCE on a diverse set of tasks, including open-ended questions, fact-checking, and scenario analysis. Compare against direct confidence elicitation and other baseline methods using metrics such as calibration curves, confusion matrices, and human evaluation of the model's reasoning about its confidence."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Elicitation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overconfident responses, especially when they lack crucial information or when the query is ambiguous. This overconfidence can lead to misinformation and poor decision-making in real-world applications. Accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for responsible AI deployment and for users to appropriately interpret model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence estimates or ensemble techniques, which may not fully capture the nuances of the model's knowledge boundaries. By explicitly contrasting a model's knowledge against what it doesn't know, we may be able to elicit more accurate confidence estimates and highlight knowledge gaps. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often assess our confidence by considering not just what we know, but also what we don't know and how that missing information might affect our judgment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Confidence Elicitation (CCE), a prompting technique that explicitly probes the model's knowledge boundaries. The method involves five steps: 1) Asking the original query, 2) Prompting the model to list key pieces of information it would need to be more certain, 3) For each piece of missing information, asking the model how its confidence would change if it had that information, 4) Prompting the model to contrast its current knowledge against these hypothetical scenarios, 5) Eliciting a final confidence estimate based on this contrastive analysis. This approach encourages the model to explicitly reason about its knowledge gaps and how they affect its confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate CCE: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended questions, 2) FEVER for fact-checking, and 3) SituatedReasoning for scenario analysis. These datasets cover a range of tasks that require different levels of certainty and knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Ensemble method: use multiple model runs or different model versions to estimate uncertainty based on output variance.",
            "Step 3: CCE Implementation": "Implement the CCE method with the following steps for each query:\na) Generate initial response\nb) List missing information\nc) Estimate confidence changes\nd) Contrast knowledge\ne) Provide final confidence estimate",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of CCE compared to baselines:\na) Calibration curves: to assess how well the confidence estimates align with actual accuracy\nb) Brier score: to measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions\nc) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): to evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds\nd) Human evaluation: to assess the quality and interpretability of the model's reasoning about its confidence",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\na) Run baseline methods\nb) Run CCE method\nc) Collect results and compute evaluation metrics\nd) Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare CCE with baselines",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, including:\na) Comparison of CCE performance across different tasks and models\nb) Qualitative analysis of the model's reasoning about missing information\nc) Identification of cases where CCE significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines\nd) Investigation of the relationship between the number and type of missing information pieces and the final confidence estimate"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1: Baseline Failure": {
                "Input": "Q: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022?\nA: The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2022 was awarded to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger.\nHow confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0 to 100?",
                "Expected Output": "Confidence: 95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method may produce a high confidence score without explicitly considering potential knowledge gaps or uncertainties."
            },
            "Example 2: CCE Success": {
                "Input": "Q: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022?\nA: The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2022 was awarded to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger.\nWhat key pieces of information would you need to be more certain about this answer?",
                "Expected Output": "1. The official announcement from the Nobel Prize committee for 2022\n2. Recent news articles confirming the winners\n3. The specific date of the announcement\n4. The research topics or contributions of the named scientists\n5. Verification that no changes or corrections were made after the initial announcement",
                "Next Input": "How would your confidence change if you had each piece of information?",
                "Expected Next Output": "1. Official announcement: Confidence would increase significantly, potentially to 100%\n2. Recent news articles: Confidence would increase moderately, to about 90-95%\n3. Specific announcement date: Slight increase in confidence, to about 85-90%\n4. Research topics: Moderate increase in confidence, to about 85-90%\n5. Verification of no changes: Slight increase in confidence, to about 85-90%",
                "Final Input": "Given your current knowledge and these potential information gains, what is your final confidence estimate?",
                "Expected Final Output": "Final confidence estimate: 80%\nReasoning: While I'm fairly confident in the answer based on my training data, I recognize that without recent verification or the official announcement, there's a possibility of errors or updates I'm not aware of. The potential for significant confidence increases with additional information, especially the official announcement, suggests that my current confidence should be moderated.",
                "Explanation": "CCE prompts the model to explicitly consider its knowledge gaps and how additional information would affect its confidence. This process leads to a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence estimate compared to the baseline method."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCE does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of the missing information identified by the model, 2) Analyzing how well the model estimates confidence changes for each piece of missing information, 3) Investigating whether the contrastive reasoning step is effectively synthesizing the information to produce a final confidence estimate. Based on these analyses, we could explore modifications to the CCE method, such as providing more structured prompts for identifying missing information or incorporating a multi-step reasoning process for the final confidence estimation. Additionally, we could investigate combining CCE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies. If these approaches do not yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of why explicit reasoning about knowledge gaps does not improve confidence estimates in LLMs, which could provide valuable insights for future research in this area."
