        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately assess their uncertainty when dealing with time-sensitive information or when asked to make predictions about future events.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically focus on static knowledge and do not explicitly account for temporal aspects in uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By probing the model's ability to reason about the same query across different time frames, we can reveal inconsistencies and gaps in knowledge that indicate uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty Probing, a technique that leverages the model's understanding of time to quantify uncertainty. Given a query, we generate a series of time-shifted versions of the same question, ranging from the past to the far future. For example, 'What is the capital of France?' becomes 'What was the capital of France in 1800?' and 'What will be the capital of France in 2100?'. The model is prompted to answer these questions and provide confidence estimates. We then analyze the pattern of responses and confidence scores across the temporal spectrum. Rapid changes in confidence or inconsistencies in answers across nearby time points indicate higher uncertainty. This method can reveal both epistemic uncertainty (gaps in knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent unpredictability of future events).",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate this method on a diverse set of queries including historical facts, current events, and future predictions. Performance will be compared against standard uncertainty estimation techniques and human expert judgments. Key metrics will include temporal calibration error, predictive accuracy decay over time, and ability to identify known historical uncertainties."

        "Title": "Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty Probing: Quantifying LLM Uncertainty Across Time",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately assess their uncertainty when dealing with time-sensitive information or when asked to make predictions about future events. This inability to properly calibrate confidence across different time frames can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation.",
        "Motivation": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs typically focus on static knowledge and do not explicitly account for temporal aspects. By probing the model's ability to reason about the same query across different time frames, we can reveal inconsistencies and gaps in knowledge that indicate uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's understanding of time to quantify both epistemic uncertainty (gaps in knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent unpredictability of future events).",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty Probing (TEUP), a technique that leverages the model's understanding of time to quantify uncertainty. Given a query, we generate a series of time-shifted versions of the same question, ranging from the past to the far future. For example, 'What is the capital of France?' becomes 'What was the capital of France in 1800?' and 'What will be the capital of France in 2100?'. The model is prompted to answer these questions and provide confidence estimates. We then analyze the pattern of responses and confidence scores across the temporal spectrum. Rapid changes in confidence or inconsistencies in answers across nearby time points indicate higher uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a diverse set of 100 queries covering historical facts, current events, and future predictions. For each query, generate 10 time-shifted versions spanning from 200 years in the past to 200 years in the future, with more dense sampling near the present.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Also include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM 2 from Google (if available) for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation.",
            "Step 4: TEUP Implementation": "Implement the TEUP method using the following steps for each query: a) Generate time-shifted versions of the query. b) Prompt the model to answer each version and provide a confidence score (0-100). c) Collect and store all responses and confidence scores.",
            "Step 5: Human Expert Evaluation": "Recruit 3-5 domain experts to provide ground truth answers and uncertainty estimates for a subset of 20 queries across all time points.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Temporal Calibration Error: Compare model confidence to accuracy across time points. b) Predictive Accuracy Decay: Measure how accuracy changes as predictions move further from the present. c) Uncertainty Correlation: Correlate model uncertainty with human expert uncertainty. d) Consistency Score: Measure answer consistency across nearby time points.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of TEUP to baselines. b) Performance across different types of queries (historical, current, future). c) Identification of patterns in uncertainty across time. d) Analysis of model behavior at 'critical points' in time (e.g., known historical changes).",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of: a) Number of time points sampled. b) Range of time covered. c) Prompt formulation for confidence estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is not confident at all and 100 is absolutely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please think step by step about any historical changes or future possibilities, and then provide your final answer along with your confidence on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is not confident at all and 100 is absolutely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought)": "Let's think about this step by step:\n1. The current capital of France is Paris, and it has been for a long time.\n2. Historically, there have been other capitals:\n   - During the Roman Empire, Lutetia (early Paris) was the capital of Roman Gaul.\n   - During the Middle Ages, other cities like Aachen were briefly capitals of the Frankish Empire, which included parts of modern France.\n   - During World War II, Vichy briefly served as the capital of Nazi-occupied France.\n3. Looking to the future, there are no current plans to change the capital, but unforeseen events (like major disasters or political changes) could theoretically lead to a change.\n4. However, Paris is deeply ingrained in French culture and history as the capital.\n\nFinal Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98\n\nI'm giving a confidence of 98 instead of 100 to account for the small possibility of unforeseen future changes, though this is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEUP)": "I will ask you about the capital of France at different points in time. For each question, please provide your answer and your confidence in that answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is not confident at all and 100 is absolutely certain. Here are the questions:\n1. What was the capital of France in 1800?\n2. What was the capital of France in 1900?\n3. What is the capital of France in 2023?\n4. What will be the capital of France in 2050?\n5. What will be the capital of France in 2200?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEUP)": "1. What was the capital of France in 1800?\nA: Paris. Confidence: 95\n\n2. What was the capital of France in 1900?\nA: Paris. Confidence: 100\n\n3. What is the capital of France in 2023?\nA: Paris. Confidence: 100\n\n4. What will be the capital of France in 2050?\nA: Paris. Confidence: 90\n\n5. What will be the capital of France in 2200?\nA: Paris. Confidence: 60\n\nExplanation: The confidence decreases for future predictions due to increasing uncertainty about potential changes over longer time periods.",
            "explanation": "TEUP provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty across time. While the baselines give high confidence for the current capital, TEUP reveals decreasing confidence for future predictions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty of long-term forecasts. It also shows slightly lower confidence for the distant past, acknowledging potential gaps in historical knowledge."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TEUP does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on the patterns of uncertainty across different types of queries and time periods. We could investigate questions such as: (1) How does uncertainty change for different types of information (e.g., political facts vs. technological predictions)? (2) Are there common 'uncertainty inflection points' across queries where model confidence changes rapidly? (3) How does the model's uncertainty compare to human expert uncertainty, and what can this tell us about the model's knowledge representation? Additionally, we could explore variations of the TEUP method, such as using contrastive prompts that explicitly ask the model to compare its knowledge across time periods, or incorporating external knowledge retrieval to ground the model's temporal reasoning."
