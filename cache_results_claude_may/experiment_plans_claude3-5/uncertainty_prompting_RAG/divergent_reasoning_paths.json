        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with complex reasoning tasks that have multiple valid solution paths.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-path reasoning or simple ensemble methods to estimate confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the human cognitive process of exploring multiple lines of thought, we propose a method that explicitly generates and compares diverse reasoning paths to better gauge uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Reasoning Paths (DRP), a prompting technique that instructs the model to generate multiple distinct solution approaches for a given problem. The prompt includes instructions like: '1. Generate three different reasoning paths to solve this problem. 2. For each path, assign a confidence score and explain why. 3. Compare the paths and highlight any contradictions or uncertainties. 4. Provide a final answer and overall confidence based on the analysis of all paths.' This method allows the model to explore various perspectives, identify potential pitfalls, and synthesize a more nuanced understanding of its own uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare DRP against standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and LogiQA. Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, calibration error, and correlation between expressed confidence and correctness."

        "Title": "Divergent Reasoning Paths: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with complex reasoning tasks that have multiple valid solution paths. This inability to properly assess confidence can lead to overconfident incorrect answers or underconfident correct answers, limiting the reliability and usefulness of these models in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically rely on single-path reasoning or simple ensemble methods to estimate confidence, which may not capture the full range of possible solutions or accurately reflect the model's true uncertainty. Inspired by the human cognitive process of exploring multiple lines of thought, we propose a method that explicitly generates and compares diverse reasoning paths to better gauge uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's ability to consider multiple perspectives and synthesize information, potentially leading to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Reasoning Paths (DRP), a prompting technique that instructs the model to generate multiple distinct solution approaches for a given problem. The prompt includes instructions like: '1. Generate three different reasoning paths to solve this problem. 2. For each path, assign a confidence score and explain why. 3.

This method allows the model to explore various perspectives, identify potential pitfalls, and synthesize a more nuanced understanding of its own uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that involve complex reasoning tasks with potential for multiple solution paths. We will use: 1) MATH dataset for mathematical problem-solving, 2) LogiQA for logical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and c) Self-consistency method (generating multiple CoT paths and taking majority vote).",
            "Step 3: DRP Implementation": "Implement the Divergent Reasoning Paths method. Create a prompt template that includes the instructions for generating multiple reasoning paths, assigning confidence scores, comparing paths, and providing a final answer with overall confidence.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. These models are suitable for complex reasoning tasks and allow for longer context windows necessary for our method.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and DRP): a) Generate answers and confidence scores for all questions. b) For DRP, use 3 reasoning paths per question. c) Use a temperature of 0.7 for all generations to encourage some diversity.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: percentage of correct final answers. b) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. c) Brier score: to assess the quality of probabilistic predictions. d) Confidence-correctness correlation: measure how well the model's confidence correlates with its correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform additional analyses: a) Compare the diversity of reasoning paths generated by DRP. b) Analyze cases where DRP outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. c) Examine how often the final answer in DRP differs from the majority of individual paths. d) Investigate the relationship between inter-path agreement and overall confidence."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: A rectangular prism has a volume of 360 cubic centimeters. If its length is 10 cm and its width is 6 cm, what is its height?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The height of the rectangular prism is 6 cm.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Q: A rectangular prism has a volume of 360 cubic centimeters. If its length is 10 cm and its width is 6 cm, what is its height? Let's approach this step-by-step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is: Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\n2) We know the volume is 360 cubic centimeters, the length is 10 cm, and the width is 6 cm.\n3) Let's substitute these values into the formula:\n   360 = 10 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 height\n4) Simplify the right side:\n   360 = 60 \u00d7 height\n5) Now, we can solve for height by dividing both sides by 60:\n   height = 360 \u00f7 60 = 6\nTherefore, the height of the rectangular prism is 6 cm.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Divergent Reasoning Paths)": "Q: A rectangular prism has a volume of 360 cubic centimeters. If its length is 10 cm and its width is 6 cm, what is its height?\n\n1. Generate three different reasoning paths to solve this problem.\n2. For each path, assign a confidence score (0-100%) and explain why.\n3. Compare the paths and highlight any contradictions or uncertainties.\n4. Provide a final answer and overall confidence based on the analysis of all paths.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Divergent Reasoning Paths)": "1. Generate three different reasoning paths:\n\nPath A (Volume Formula):\n1) Use the formula: Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\n2) Substitute known values: 360 = 10 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 height\n3) Simplify: 360 = 60 \u00d7 height\n4) Solve for height: height = 360 \u00f7 60 = 6 cm\n\nPath B (Area and Height Relationship):\n1) Calculate the area of the base: Area = length \u00d7 width = 10 \u00d7 6 = 60 sq cm\n2) Use the relationship: Volume = base area \u00d7 height\n3) Substitute values: 360 = 60 \u00d7 height\n4) Solve for height: height = 360 \u00f7 60 = 6 cm\n\nPath C (Dimensional Analysis):\n1) Express the volume in terms of length units: 360 cm\u00b3\n2) Divide by known length and width: 360 cm\u00b3 \u00f7 (10 cm \u00d7 6 cm)\n3) Simplify: 360 cm\u00b3 \u00f7 60 cm\u00b2 = 6 cm\n\n2. Assign confidence scores:\n\nPath A: 95% confidence. This method directly applies the volume formula, which is a straightforward and reliable approach for this problem.\n\nPath B: 90% confidence. This method uses the relationship between volume, base area, and height, which is correct but introduces an extra step that could potentially lead to rounding errors.\n\nPath C: 85% confidence. While dimensional analysis is a valid approach, it's less commonly used for this type of problem and might be more prone to conceptual errors.\n\n3. Compare paths and highlight contradictions/uncertainties:\nAll three paths lead to the same result of 6 cm for the height. There are no contradictions between the paths. The main uncertainty lies in the potential for calculation errors, especially in paths B and C which involve more steps or less common approaches.\n\n4. Final answer and overall confidence:\nBased on the analysis of all paths, the height of the rectangular prism is 6 cm. The overall confidence is 95%. This high confidence is due to the consistency of results across all paths and the use of well-established mathematical principles. The slight reduction from 100% confidence accounts for the small possibility of overlooking alternative approaches or the presence of unstated assumptions in the problem.",
            "Explanation": "The DRP method provides a more comprehensive analysis by exploring multiple solution paths, assigning individual confidences, and synthesizing a final answer with overall confidence. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the problem and potential sources of uncertainty, which is not captured by the standard or chain-of-thought prompting methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Divergent Reasoning Paths method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the diversity and quality of generated reasoning paths to understand if the method is producing genuinely different approaches or merely rephrasing the same logic.\n2. Investigate the relationship between inter-path agreement and accuracy to see if there's a correlation that could be leveraged for improved confidence estimation.\n3. Experiment with varying the number of reasoning paths (e.g., 5 or 7 instead of 3) to see if more paths lead to better uncertainty estimates.\n4. Implement a hybrid approach that combines DRP with other techniques like calibration or ensemble methods.\n5. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to categorize the types of problems where DRP performs well or poorly, which could lead to insights for developing more targeted uncertainty quantification methods.\n6. Explore the use of DRP as a data augmentation technique for fine-tuning smaller models on uncertainty estimation tasks.\nBy pursuing these alternative directions, we can still gain valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty in language models and potentially develop novel approaches for improving their calibration and reliability."
