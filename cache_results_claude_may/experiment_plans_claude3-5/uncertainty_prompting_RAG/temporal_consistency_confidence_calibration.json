    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to maintain consistent levels of confidence over time or across related queries, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on point-in-time confidence estimation without considering temporal consistency.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts tend to maintain relatively stable confidence levels over time for a given domain of knowledge. Simulating this temporal consistency in LLMs could lead to more reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Confidence Calibration (TC3), a prompting technique that assesses and enforces consistency in confidence estimates across time and related queries. The process involves: 1) Initial query response and confidence estimation. 2) Temporal prompting: 'Imagine it's one week later. Has any new information likely emerged that would change your confidence? If so, how?' 3) Related query generation: 'Generate 3-5 related queries that test similar knowledge.' 4) Confidence comparison: Prompt the model to answer the related queries and compare confidence levels. 5) Consistency analysis: 'Analyze the consistency of your confidence levels across the original and related queries. Explain any discrepancies.' 6) Calibration: Based on the analysis, prompt the model to provide a final, calibrated confidence estimate for the original query. This method encourages the model to consider the stability of its knowledge over time and across related topics.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test TC3 on a diverse set of queries spanning different knowledge domains and time sensitivities. Compare against standard confidence elicitation techniques and methods that don't consider temporal aspects. Evaluate based on consistency of confidence estimates for related queries, ability to adjust confidence appropriately for time-sensitive information, and overall calibration metrics when compared to human expert ratings over time."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Confidence Calibration (TC3): Improving Uncertainty Estimates in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to maintain consistent levels of confidence over time or across related queries, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. This inconsistency can result in unreliable decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on point-in-time confidence estimation without considering temporal consistency. Human experts, however, tend to maintain relatively stable confidence levels over time for a given domain of knowledge. Simulating this temporal consistency in LLMs could lead to more reliable uncertainty estimates. Our proposed method, TC3, aims to assess and enforce consistency in confidence estimates across time and related queries, potentially leading to better-calibrated and more human-like uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Confidence Calibration (TC3), a prompting technique that assesses and enforces consistency in confidence estimates across time and related queries. The process involves six steps: 1) Initial query response and confidence estimation. 2) Temporal prompting to consider potential changes in confidence over time. 3) Related query generation to test similar knowledge. 4) Confidence comparison across related queries. 5) Consistency analysis of confidence levels. 6) Calibration based on the analysis to provide a final, calibrated confidence estimate for the original query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a diverse set of queries spanning different knowledge domains and time sensitivities. Use existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, TimeQA, and subsets of Natural Questions. Augment these with custom queries that explicitly test temporal aspects of knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard confidence elicitation techniques: a) Direct confidence estimation: Ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Calibrated probabilities: Use temperature scaling or Platt scaling on the model's logits. c) Ensemble methods: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: TC3 Implementation": "Implement the TC3 method with the following prompts for each step: 1) Initial response: \"Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUERY]\". 2) Temporal prompting: \"Imagine it's one week later. Has any new information likely emerged that would change your confidence? If so, how?\". 3) Related query generation: \"Generate 3-5 related queries that test similar knowledge to the original question.\". 4) Confidence comparison: \"Answer each related query and provide a confidence score for each.\". 5) Consistency analysis: \"Analyze the consistency of your confidence levels across the original and related queries. Explain any discrepancies.\". 6) Calibration: \"Based on your analysis, provide a final, calibrated confidence estimate for the original query.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, test with open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each query in the dataset: a) Run all baseline methods and record their confidence estimates. b) Run the TC3 method, recording intermediate outputs at each step and the final calibrated confidence. c) Store all outputs, including intermediate steps for TC3, for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Confidence Consistency: Measure the standard deviation of confidence scores across related queries. b) Temporal Stability: Compare confidence scores before and after the temporal prompting step. c) Calibration Error: Calculate the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy on a held-out test set. d) Brier Score: Compute the mean squared error of probabilistic predictions. e) Human Evaluation: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to rate the reasonableness of confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare TC3 performance against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze how TC3 performs across different knowledge domains and time sensitivities. c) Investigate cases where TC3 significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines. d) Examine the intermediate steps of TC3 to understand how each contributes to the final calibrated confidence."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 was awarded jointly to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger \"for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science\". Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TC3 Step 1)": "Q: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TC3 Step 1)": "A: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 was awarded jointly to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger for their work on quantum entanglement and quantum information science. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TC3 Step 2)": "Imagine it's one week later. Has any new information likely emerged that would change your confidence? If so, how?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TC3 Step 2)": "It's unlikely that any new information would have emerged in just one week that would significantly change my confidence in this answer. Nobel Prize announcements are widely publicized and thoroughly vetted before being made public. Unless there was an unprecedented scandal or retraction, which is extremely rare, my confidence would remain the same. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TC3 Step 3)": "Generate 3-5 related queries that test similar knowledge to the original question about the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TC3 Step 3)": "1. What was the specific area of physics recognized by the 2022 Nobel Prize?\n2. Who were the other nominees for the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics?\n3. What institutions were the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics winners affiliated with?\n4. How many people shared the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics?\n5. What were the key experiments or discoveries that led to the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TC3 Step 4)": "Answer each related query and provide a confidence score for each.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TC3 Step 4)": "1. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics recognized work in quantum entanglement and quantum information science. Confidence: 95\n2. The Nobel Committee does not disclose other nominees for 50 years after the award. Confidence: 100\n3. Alain Aspect was affiliated with Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay and \u00c9cole Polytechnique, John F. Clauser with J.F. Clauser & Associates, and Anton Zeilinger with University of Vienna. Confidence: 90\n4. Three people shared the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Confidence: 100\n5. The key experiments involved demonstrating the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science through experiments with entangled photons. Confidence: 93",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TC3 Step 5)": "Analyze the consistency of your confidence levels across the original and related queries. Explain any discrepancies.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TC3 Step 5)": "The confidence levels across the original and related queries are generally consistent, ranging from 90 to 100. The highest confidence (100) is for factual information that is absolutely certain, such as the number of winners and the Nobel Committee's policy on nominees. The lowest confidence (90) is for the specific institutional affiliations, which might have some minor inaccuracies due to the complexity of academic appointments. The original question and the questions about the specific area of physics and key experiments have very high confidence (93-95) because these are well-documented aspects of the Nobel Prize announcement. The slight variations in confidence reflect the nuanced differences in the certainty of various aspects of the Nobel Prize information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TC3 Step 6)": "Based on your analysis, provide a final, calibrated confidence estimate for the original query about who won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TC3 Step 6)": "After analyzing the consistency of confidence levels across related queries and considering the potential for minor inaccuracies in specific details, I would provide a final, calibrated confidence estimate of 94 for the original query about who won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. This slight adjustment from the original 95 reflects a conservative approach that accounts for the small possibility of minor errors in recalling specific details, while still maintaining very high confidence in the core information about the prize winners and their field of study.",
            "explanation": "The TC3 method demonstrates a more nuanced and self-reflective approach to confidence estimation. By considering temporal aspects, generating related queries, and analyzing consistency, it provides a more robust and calibrated confidence score. The final confidence of 94 is slightly lower than the initial 95, reflecting a more conservative estimate after careful consideration of potential sources of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the TC3 method does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the intermediate steps to understand where the method falls short. This could involve examining which types of queries or knowledge domains benefit most from TC3, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the method. 2) Investigate the relationship between the number and diversity of related queries generated and the quality of calibration. This could lead to insights on optimal query generation strategies. 3) Explore combining TC3 with other calibration methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibrated probabilities, to create a hybrid approach. 4) Analyze the temporal aspect more deeply, varying the time frame in the temporal prompting step to understand how different time scales affect confidence estimates. 5) Conduct a detailed error analysis to categorize the types of queries where TC3 performs poorly, which could inform the development of more specialized calibration techniques for different query types. These alternative directions could transform the project into an insightful analysis of confidence calibration in LLMs, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
