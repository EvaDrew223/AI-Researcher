    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when dealing with complex or ambiguous queries that may lead to logical inconsistencies.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mostly rely on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By deliberately introducing logical inconsistencies and observing how the model responds, we can gain insights into its underlying uncertainty and decision-making process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel prompting technique called 'Logical Inconsistency Injection' (LII). Given a query, we first generate multiple logically inconsistent variations of the query using the LLM itself. We then prompt the model with these inconsistent queries alongside the original query, asking it to identify and resolve the inconsistencies. The model's ability (or inability) to reconcile these inconsistencies serves as a measure of its uncertainty. We quantify this by analyzing the model's explanations, the number of inconsistencies it identifies, and the coherence of its final response. The prompts are carefully constructed to encourage the model to explicitly reason about its confidence in resolving each inconsistency.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate LII against standard confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on a range of tasks, including factual QA, logical reasoning, and ambiguous queries. We'll use metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human judgments of uncertainty. Additionally, we'll conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different types of logical inconsistencies on uncertainty estimation."

        "Title": "Logical Inconsistency Injection: A Novel Prompting Method for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when dealing with complex or ambiguous queries that may lead to logical inconsistencies. This inability to accurately assess confidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs mostly rely on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods, which may not fully capture the model's underlying decision-making process. By deliberately introducing logical inconsistencies and observing how the model responds, we can gain deeper insights into its uncertainty and reasoning capabilities. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning abilities to assess its confidence, potentially leading to more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel prompting technique called 'Logical Inconsistency Injection' (LII). The method consists of the following steps: 1) Given a query, generate multiple logically inconsistent variations using the LLM itself. 2) Prompt the model with these inconsistent queries alongside the original query, asking it to identify and resolve the inconsistencies. 3) Analyze the model's explanations, the number of inconsistencies it identifies, and the coherence of its final response to quantify uncertainty. 4) Use carefully constructed prompts to encourage the model to explicitly reason about its confidence in resolving each inconsistency.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) LogiQA for logical reasoning, and 3) AmbigQA for ambiguous queries. These datasets cover a range of scenarios where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. 2) Ensemble method: Use 5 different few-shot prompts for each query and calculate the variance in responses.",
            "Step 3: LII Implementation": "For each query q in the datasets: a) Generate 3 logically inconsistent variations of q using the prompt: 'Generate 3 variations of the following query that introduce logical inconsistencies: [q]'. b) Construct the LII prompt: 'Original query: [q]. Inconsistent variations: [v1], [v2], [v3]. Identify the inconsistencies in these variations, resolve them, and answer the original query. For each step, state your confidence level (0-100) and explain why.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each method (baselines and LII), we will calculate: 1) Calibration error: Compare model confidence to actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Correlation with human judgments: Have human annotators rate the difficulty/ambiguity of each query and correlate with model uncertainty. 4) F1 score: Measure the accuracy of the final answers.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of: 1) Number of inconsistent variations (1, 3, 5). 2) Types of inconsistencies (logical, factual, semantic). 3) Prompt structure (with/without explicit confidence elicitation).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze the results to compare LII with baselines across different task types. Examine how well LII captures uncertainty in different scenarios (e.g., factual recall vs. logical reasoning)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. He took his historic first steps on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission. Confidence: 95/100",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for confidence, but doesn't provide insight into the reasoning process or potential uncertainties."
            },
            "LII Example": {
                "Input": "Original query: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Inconsistent variations: 1) Who was the second person to walk on the moon, Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin? 2) Did Neil Armstrong or Yuri Gagarin first step on the lunar surface? 3) Was the moon landing in 1969 or 1970? Identify the inconsistencies in these variations, resolve them, and answer the original query. For each step, state your confidence level (0-100) and explain why.",
                "Output": "Inconsistency Identification:\n1. The first variation incorrectly suggests Neil Armstrong might be the second person on the moon. Confidence: 100/100 (This is a clear factual error)\n2. The second variation introduces Yuri Gagarin, who never walked on the moon. Confidence: 100/100 (This is a clear factual error)\n3. The third variation questions the year of the moon landing. Confidence: 95/100 (I'm very confident about the year, but there's a small chance I might be off by one year)\n\nResolution:\n1. Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon, not the second. Buzz Aldrin was the second. Confidence: 100/100\n2. Yuri Gagarin was the first human in space, but never walked on the moon. Neil Armstrong was the first to walk on the moon. Confidence: 100/100\n3. The moon landing occurred in 1969, not 1970. Confidence: 99/100 (I'm extremely confident about this date)\n\nAnswer to original query:\nThe first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 100/100\n\nExplanation: I'm absolutely certain about this fact. It's a well-documented historical event that Neil Armstrong was the first person to step onto the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission. The process of resolving the inconsistencies has reinforced my confidence in this answer.",
                "Explanation": "The LII method forces the model to confront and resolve inconsistencies, providing a more nuanced view of its confidence and reasoning process. It demonstrates how the model handles different types of inconsistencies and how this process affects its final confidence assessment."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the LII method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why LLMs struggle with uncertainty quantification. We could investigate: 1) The types of inconsistencies that LLMs find most challenging to resolve. 2) How the model's confidence changes throughout the reasoning process. 3) The relationship between the number and type of inconsistencies and the model's final uncertainty estimate. 4) How different prompting strategies affect the model's ability to reason about its own uncertainty. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs and suggest directions for improving their metacognitive abilities."
