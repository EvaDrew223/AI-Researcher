    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when dealing with semantically complex queries that involve multiple concepts or relations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically treat queries as atomic units or use simple decomposition strategies that don't explicitly address semantic complexity.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often break down complex problems into simpler components to assess their overall confidence. We propose adapting this strategy for LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Confidence Calibration via Semantic Decomposition (CCSD). The prompting procedure involves: 1) Analyzing the input query to identify key semantic components (e.g., entities, relations, attributes). 2) Generating sub-queries for each semantic component. 3) Estimating confidence for each sub-query independently. 4) Prompting the model to explain potential interactions or dependencies between sub-queries. 5) Synthesizing a final confidence estimate by combining sub-query confidences, accounting for their interactions. This method allows the model to assess its confidence more granularly and identify specific areas of uncertainty within complex queries.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CCSD against baseline confidence estimation methods on semantically complex tasks from datasets like HotpotQA and ConceptNet. Evaluate using metrics such as decomposition-aware calibration error, confidence granularity, and the ability to identify specific sources of uncertainty within complex queries."

        "Title": "Confidence Calibration via Semantic Decomposition: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when dealing with semantically complex queries that involve multiple concepts or relations. This leads to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones, particularly for queries that require understanding and integrating multiple pieces of information.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically treat queries as atomic units or use simple decomposition strategies that don't explicitly address semantic complexity. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced interactions between different semantic components of a query, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates. Human experts, on the other hand, often break down complex problems into simpler components to assess their overall confidence. By adapting this strategy for LLMs, we can potentially improve their ability to accurately quantify uncertainty in complex scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Confidence Calibration via Semantic Decomposition (CCSD), a novel prompting method that aims to improve confidence calibration in LLMs. The CCSD procedure involves five main steps: 1) Analyzing the input query to identify key semantic components (e.g., entities, relations, attributes). 2) Generating sub-queries for each semantic component. 3) Estimating confidence for each sub-query independently. 4) Prompting the model to explain potential interactions or dependencies between sub-queries. 5) Synthesizing a final confidence estimate by combining sub-query confidences, accounting for their interactions. This method allows the model to assess its confidence more granularly and identify specific areas of uncertainty within complex queries.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: HotpotQA and ConceptNet. For HotpotQA, we'll focus on the dev set, which contains 7,405 multi-hop questions. For ConceptNet, we'll create a test set of 1,000 complex queries that involve multiple relations or concepts.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. 2) Basic decomposition: Break the query into simpler sub-queries without considering semantic relationships, then aggregate confidences using a simple average.",
            "Step 3: CCSD Implementation": "Implement the CCSD method with the following sub-steps: a) Semantic Analysis: Prompt the model to identify key semantic components in the query. b) Sub-query Generation: Generate targeted sub-queries for each semantic component. c) Confidence Estimation: Estimate confidence for each sub-query. d) Interaction Analysis: Prompt the model to explain potential interactions between sub-queries. e) Confidence Synthesis: Combine sub-query confidences, accounting for interactions.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments. We'll also test GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We'll use the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between confidence and accuracy. 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE): Captures the worst-case miscalibration. 3) Brier Score: Assesses both calibration and resolution. 4) Decomposition-aware Calibration Error: A new metric we'll introduce to measure calibration quality considering semantic decomposition.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. b) Run the CCSD method and collect results. c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for both baselines and CCSD.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis, including: a) Compare CCSD performance against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze how CCSD performs on queries with different levels of semantic complexity. c) Investigate cases where CCSD significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines. d) Examine the quality and relevance of generated sub-queries and interaction analyses.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each CCSD component: a) Remove the interaction analysis step. b) Use different methods for combining sub-query confidences. c) Vary the number of sub-queries generated.",
            "Step 9: Robustness Check": "Test CCSD on out-of-distribution examples by creating a small set of complex queries that combine concepts from both HotpotQA and ConceptNet."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: The film that Greta Gerwig directed, which starred Saoirse Ronan as Jo March, was based on a novel by which American author? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The film you're referring to is 'Little Women' (2019), which was based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCSD; Step 1: Semantic Analysis)": "Analyze the following query and identify its key semantic components (e.g., entities, relations, attributes): 'The film that Greta Gerwig directed, which starred Saoirse Ronan as Jo March, was based on a novel by which American author?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCSD; Step 1: Semantic Analysis)": "Key semantic components:\n1. Entity: Greta Gerwig (director)\n2. Entity: Saoirse Ronan (actor)\n3. Entity: Jo March (character)\n4. Relation: Greta Gerwig directed a film\n5. Relation: Saoirse Ronan starred in the film as Jo March\n6. Relation: The film was based on a novel\n7. Attribute: The novel's author is American",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCSD; Step 2: Sub-query Generation)": "Generate targeted sub-queries for each semantic component identified in the previous step.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCSD; Step 2: Sub-query Generation)": "Sub-queries:\n1. What film did Greta Gerwig direct that starred Saoirse Ronan?\n2. Who played the character of Jo March in a Greta Gerwig film?\n3. What novel is the basis for the film directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Saoirse Ronan as Jo March?\n4. Who is the American author of the novel that the Greta Gerwig film is based on?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCSD; Step 3: Confidence Estimation)": "For each sub-query, provide an answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCSD; Step 3: Confidence Estimation)": "1. A: Little Women (2019). Confidence: 0.98\n2. A: Saoirse Ronan. Confidence: 0.99\n3. A: Little Women. Confidence: 0.97\n4. A: Louisa May Alcott. Confidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCSD; Step 4: Interaction Analysis)": "Explain potential interactions or dependencies between the sub-queries and their answers.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCSD; Step 4: Interaction Analysis)": "The sub-queries are closely related and support each other:\n1. Sub-queries 1 and 2 confirm each other, increasing confidence in the film identification.\n2. Sub-query 3 links the film to the novel, which is crucial for answering the main question.\n3. Sub-query 4 directly addresses the main question, but its accuracy depends on the correctness of the previous sub-queries.\n4. The high confidence in identifying the film and its key elements (director, actor, character) strengthens the overall confidence in the final answer about the author.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCSD; Step 5: Confidence Synthesis)": "Based on the sub-query confidences and their interactions, provide a final answer to the original question with a synthesized confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCSD; Step 5: Confidence Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The film that Greta Gerwig directed, which starred Saoirse Ronan as Jo March, was based on a novel by Louisa May Alcott.\n\nSynthesized Confidence Score: 0.96\n\nExplanation: The high confidence in identifying the film (0.98) and its key elements (0.99 for Saoirse Ronan as Jo March) provides a strong foundation. The direct answer to the main question about the author has a slightly lower confidence (0.95), but it's supported by the high confidence in linking the film to the novel 'Little Women' (0.97). The strong interactions between these elements allow us to maintain a high overall confidence, slightly higher than the lowest sub-query confidence but not as high as the highest, reflecting the complexity of the question.",
            "explanation": "CCSD improves confidence calibration by breaking down the complex query into semantic components, assessing confidence for each part, and then synthesizing a final confidence score that accounts for interactions between components. This approach allows for more nuanced and accurate confidence estimation compared to direct prompting, which might overlook the complexity of the query and potential sources of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCSD doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot our research in several directions: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why CCSD fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling semantic complexity. 2) Explore alternative decomposition strategies, such as hierarchical decomposition or using external knowledge bases to guide the decomposition process. 3) Investigate how different prompting techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, few-shot learning) can be integrated with semantic decomposition to enhance performance. 4) Develop a new metric that better captures the nuances of confidence calibration in semantically complex queries, which could be a valuable contribution to the field even if our original method doesn't outperform baselines. 5) Examine how CCSD performs across different types of queries and identify specific categories where it excels, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method."
