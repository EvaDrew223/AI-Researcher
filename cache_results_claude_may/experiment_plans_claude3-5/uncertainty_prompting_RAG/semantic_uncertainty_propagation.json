        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately propagate uncertainty through chains of reasoning, leading to compounding errors and overconfidence in multi-step tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods like chain-of-thought prompting focus on improving reasoning steps but don't explicitly address uncertainty propagation.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly modeling how uncertainty propagates through semantic relationships and logical steps, we can potentially achieve more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Propagation (SUP), a prompting technique that guides the model to explicitly reason about uncertainty at each step of a multi-step task. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Break down the task into semantic sub-components, 2) Assign initial uncertainty estimates to each component, 3) Reason about how uncertainties combine or propagate through logical operations, and 4) Iteratively update and refine uncertainty estimates as the reasoning progresses. SUP prompts include specific instructions like 'If you're 70% certain about A and 80% certain about B, how certain can you be about A AND B?' to guide proper uncertainty propagation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SUP against standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH. Assess not only final answer accuracy but also the quality and calibration of intermediate uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Semantic Uncertainty Propagation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately propagate uncertainty through chains of reasoning, leading to compounding errors and overconfidence in multi-step tasks. This issue is particularly problematic in complex reasoning scenarios where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for reliable decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like chain-of-thought prompting focus on improving reasoning steps but don't explicitly address uncertainty propagation. By explicitly modeling how uncertainty propagates through semantic relationships and logical steps, we can potentially achieve more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates in complex reasoning tasks. This approach is inspired by probabilistic reasoning in human cognition, where we intuitively adjust our confidence levels as we progress through a chain of logic.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Propagation (SUP), a prompting technique that guides the model to explicitly reason about uncertainty at each step of a multi-step task. The SUP prompt instructs the model to: 1) Break down the task into semantic sub-components, 2) Assign initial uncertainty estimates to each component, 3) Reason about how uncertainties combine or propagate through logical operations, and 4) Iteratively update and refine uncertainty estimates as the reasoning progresses. SUP prompts include specific instructions like 'If you're 70% certain about A and 80% certain about B, how certain can you be about A AND B?' to guide proper uncertainty propagation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets are suitable for evaluating multi-step reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Prompts": "Implement three baseline prompting methods: 1) Direct prompting: simply ask the question, 2) Zero-shot chain-of-thought: append 'Let's approach this step by step:' to the question, 3) Few-shot chain-of-thought: prepend 2-3 examples of step-by-step reasoning to the prompt.",
            "Step 3: SUP Prompt Construction": "Develop the SUP prompt template. It should include: a) Instructions for breaking down the problem into sub-components, b) Guidelines for assigning initial uncertainty estimates, c) Rules for combining uncertainties (e.g., 'AND' operations decrease certainty, 'OR' operations increase it), d) Instructions for updating uncertainties after each reasoning step. Example prompt structure: 'Break down the problem into steps. For each step, estimate your certainty (0-100%). As you reason through the steps, update your certainty based on how the information combines. If you use uncertain information, your conclusion should be less certain.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the datasets: a) Apply each baseline prompt and the SUP prompt, b) Record the final answer, intermediate reasoning steps, and uncertainty estimates (for SUP), c) Use 3 different random seeds for each prompt to account for variability.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Answer accuracy: percentage of correct final answers, b) Uncertainty calibration: compare model's reported uncertainty with empirical accuracy, c) Brier score: measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions, d) Uncertainty resolution: assess how uncertainty estimates change throughout the reasoning process.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct the following analyses: a) Compare SUP performance against baselines across all metrics, b) Analyze how uncertainty propagates in correct vs. incorrect solutions, c) Identify problem types where SUP shows the most improvement, d) Examine cases where SUP fails to improve over baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: James has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does James have now?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "James has 6 apples now.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUP)": "Q: James has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does James have now? Break down the problem into steps. For each step, estimate your certainty (0-100%). As you reason through the steps, update your certainty based on how the information combines. If you use uncertain information, your conclusion should be less certain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUP)": "Step 1: James starts with 5 apples. (Certainty: 100%)\nStep 2: James gives 2 apples to his friend. 5 - 2 = 3 apples left. (Certainty: 100%)\nStep 3: James buys 3 more apples. 3 + 3 = 6 apples total. (Certainty: 100%)\nFinal Answer: James has 6 apples now. (Overall Certainty: 100%)\nExplanation: Each step in this problem involves simple arithmetic with clearly stated numbers. There's no ambiguity or uncertainty in the given information or the calculations, so we maintain 100% certainty throughout the process.",
            "Explanation": "While both methods arrive at the correct answer, the SUP approach explicitly reasons about certainty at each step, providing a more transparent reasoning process. This becomes more valuable in complex problems where uncertainties may compound or interact in non-trivial ways."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SUP doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine: 1) Whether the model struggles to assign meaningful initial uncertainties, 2) If the uncertainty propagation rules are being applied consistently, 3) Whether the final uncertainty estimates align with human intuitions. We could also explore variations of SUP, such as providing more explicit rules for uncertainty combination or incorporating external knowledge to ground initial uncertainty estimates. Additionally, we could investigate whether SUP prompts lead to any qualitative improvements in reasoning, even if quantitative metrics don't show significant gains. This could involve a detailed analysis of the generated reasoning chains, focusing on logical coherence and the appropriate use of given information."
