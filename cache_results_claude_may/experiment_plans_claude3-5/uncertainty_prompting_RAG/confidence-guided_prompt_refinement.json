    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current prompting methods often fail to adaptively refine prompts based on the model's expressed uncertainty, leading to suboptimal performance and poor calibration.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use static prompts or simple iterative refinement strategies.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically refining prompts based on the model's expressed confidence, we can guide the model towards more certain and accurate responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Guided Prompt Refinement (CGPR), a method that iteratively refines prompts based on the model's expressed uncertainty. The process begins with a base prompt and follows these steps: (1) Generate an initial response and confidence score. (2) Analyze the response to identify low-confidence areas. (3) Automatically generate targeted sub-prompts to address these areas. (4) Incorporate the sub-prompts into the main prompt and repeat. This process continues until a confidence threshold is reached or a maximum number of iterations is performed. The final prompt is then used to generate the ultimate response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will compare CGPR against static prompting and other dynamic prompting methods on tasks such as multi-hop reasoning, open-domain QA, and complex problem-solving. Evaluation metrics will include task performance, calibration metrics, and prompt efficiency (i.e., how quickly the method converges to a high-confidence response)."

        "Title": "Confidence-Guided Prompt Refinement: Improving LLM Performance and Calibration through Adaptive Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Current prompting methods often fail to adaptively refine prompts based on the model's expressed uncertainty, leading to suboptimal performance and poor calibration in large language models (LLMs). This issue results in inconsistent and potentially unreliable outputs, especially in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use static prompts or simple iterative refinement strategies, which do not fully leverage the model's own assessment of its confidence. By dynamically refining prompts based on the model's expressed confidence, we can guide the model towards more certain and accurate responses. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often reassess and refine our thinking when we're unsure about a topic. Our method aims to mimic this process in LLMs, potentially leading to more robust and reliable outputs across a variety of tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Guided Prompt Refinement (CGPR), a method that iteratively refines prompts based on the model's expressed uncertainty. The process begins with a base prompt and follows these steps: (1) Generate an initial response and confidence score. (2) Analyze the response to identify low-confidence areas. (3) Automatically generate targeted sub-prompts to address these areas. (4) Incorporate the sub-prompts into the main prompt and repeat. This process continues until a confidence threshold is reached or a maximum number of iterations is performed. The final prompt is then used to generate the ultimate response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for our experiments: (1) Multi-hop reasoning: HotpotQA, (2) Open-domain QA: Natural Questions, and (3) Complex problem-solving: GSM8K (math word problems). These datasets cover a range of task complexities and domains.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models are widely used and have shown strong performance across various tasks.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: simply input the question to the model. (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: append \"Let's approach this step by step:\" to the question. (3) Few-shot CoT: prepend 2-3 examples of questions with step-by-step reasoning before the target question.",
            "Step 4: CGPR Implementation": "Implement the CGPR method with the following sub-steps: (a) Initial prompt generation: Create a base prompt for each task type. (b) Confidence scoring: Implement a method to extract confidence scores from the model's output. This can be done by appending \"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your answer?\" to each generation step. (c) Low-confidence area identification: Develop an algorithm to identify parts of the response with low confidence. (d) Sub-prompt generation: Create a method to automatically generate targeted sub-prompts for low-confidence areas. (e) Prompt refinement: Implement the iterative refinement process, incorporating sub-prompts into the main prompt.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Run all baseline methods and record their performance. (b) Run the CGPR method, recording performance at each iteration. (c) Set a maximum of 5 iterations for CGPR and a confidence threshold of 8/10.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Task-specific metrics: Exact Match and F1 score for QA tasks, accuracy for math problems. (2) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). (3) Prompt efficiency: Number of iterations needed to reach the confidence threshold.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: (a) Performance comparison between CGPR and baselines. (b) Analysis of how confidence scores change over iterations. (c) Examination of generated sub-prompts and their effectiveness. (d) Investigation of cases where CGPR performs particularly well or poorly."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have now?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The cafeteria now has 9 apples.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CGPR; Initial Step)": "Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have now? Let's approach this step by step: [Your reasoning here] Answer: [Your final answer here] On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CGPR; Initial Step)": "Let's approach this step by step:\n1. Initial number of apples: 23\n2. Apples used for lunch: 20\n3. Apples remaining after lunch: 23 - 20 = 3\n4. New apples bought: 6\n5. Final number of apples: 3 + 6 = 9\n\nAnswer: The cafeteria now has 9 apples.\n\nConfidence: 9/10",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CGPR; Refinement Step)": "Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have now? Previous reasoning: [Insert previous reasoning]. To improve our confidence, let's double-check our calculation of apples remaining after lunch. How many apples were left after using 20 for lunch? Let's approach this step by step: [Your reasoning here] Answer: [Your final answer here] On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CGPR; Refinement Step)": "Let's double-check our calculation of apples remaining after lunch:\n1. Initial number of apples: 23\n2. Apples used for lunch: 20\n3. Apples remaining after lunch: 23 - 20 = 3\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation. Now, let's complete the problem:\n4. New apples bought: 6\n5. Final number of apples: 3 + 6 = 9\n\nAnswer: The cafeteria now has 9 apples.\n\nConfidence: 10/10",
            "explanation": "The CGPR method allows for iterative refinement and confidence assessment, potentially leading to more accurate and confident responses compared to direct prompting."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CGPR method doesn't significantly improve performance or calibration, we can pivot our analysis in several ways. First, we could investigate why the confidence scores aren't accurately reflecting the model's true performance, perhaps by comparing them with human-annotated confidence scores. Second, we could analyze the generated sub-prompts to understand if they're effectively targeting the areas of uncertainty, and if not, develop alternative strategies for sub-prompt generation. Third, we might explore different ways of incorporating confidence scores into the prompt refinement process, such as using a weighted average of confidence scores across multiple steps rather than a single overall score. Finally, we could turn this into an analysis paper by conducting a detailed examination of how different types of prompts affect the model's expressed confidence versus its actual performance, potentially uncovering insights about the model's metacognitive abilities and limitations."
