        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when dealing with tasks that require integration of information across multiple modalities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-modality inputs or treat multi-modal inputs as separate components.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly analyzing the coherence between different modalities, we can better gauge the model's true understanding and calibrate its confidence accordingly.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Modal Coherence Analysis (MMCA), a prompting technique for confidence calibration in multi-modal tasks. The method involves: 1) Individual modality analysis: The model processes each modality separately, generating intermediate outputs and confidence scores. 2) Cross-modal coherence check: The model is prompted to identify consistencies and discrepancies between the modalities. 3) Coherence-based recalibration: Based on the degree of cross-modal coherence, the model adjusts its confidence. High coherence reinforces confidence, while low coherence reduces it. The final confidence score is a function of the individual modality confidences and the coherence assessment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MMCA on multi-modal tasks such as visual question answering and multi-modal fact verification. Compare against unimodal baselines and other multi-modal confidence estimation techniques. Use calibration metrics and human evaluation of the model's cross-modal reasoning justifications."

        "Title": "Multi-Modal Coherence Analysis for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when dealing with tasks that require integration of information across multiple modalities. This inaccurate confidence estimation can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation in multi-modal applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on single-modality inputs or treat multi-modal inputs as separate components. By explicitly analyzing the coherence between different modalities, we can better gauge the model's true understanding and calibrate its confidence accordingly. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often cross-reference information from different sources to assess our confidence in a conclusion.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Modal Coherence Analysis (MMCA), a prompting technique for confidence calibration in multi-modal tasks. The method involves three main steps: 1) Individual modality analysis: The model processes each modality separately, generating intermediate outputs and confidence scores. 2) Cross-modal coherence check: The model is prompted to identify consistencies and discrepancies between the modalities. 3) Coherence-based recalibration: Based on the degree of cross-modal coherence, the model adjusts its confidence. High coherence reinforces confidence, while low coherence reduces it. The final confidence score is a function of the individual modality confidences and the coherence assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two multi-modal datasets: 1) VQA-v2 for visual question answering, and 2) FEVEROUS for multi-modal fact verification. For VQA-v2, we'll use a subset of 10,000 image-question pairs. For FEVEROUS, we'll use a subset of 5,000 claim-evidence pairs.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baselines: 1) Unimodal: Process text and image separately and combine results. 2) Simple Multi-modal: Concatenate text and image features without explicit coherence analysis. Use GPT-4 with vision capabilities for both baselines.",
            "Step 3: MMCA Implementation": "Implement the proposed MMCA method using GPT-4 with vision capabilities. For each input: a) Process text and image separately. b) Perform cross-modal coherence analysis. c) Recalibrate confidence based on coherence.",
            "Step 4: Prompting Strategy": "Design prompts for each step of MMCA. For individual modality analysis: 'Analyze the [text/image] and provide your answer and confidence score.' For cross-modal coherence: 'Compare your analysis of the text and image. Identify consistencies and discrepancies.' For recalibration: 'Based on the coherence between modalities, adjust your final confidence score.'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: 1) Accuracy: Compare model predictions against ground truth. 2) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). 3) AUC-ROC for confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (100 samples) to assess the quality of cross-modal reasoning justifications provided by MMCA compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze results to identify patterns in when MMCA outperforms baselines, and examine cases where coherence analysis leads to significant confidence adjustments."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Image: A pizza on a plate. Question: What toppings are on the pizza?",
                "Output": "The pizza appears to have cheese, tomatoes, and basil as toppings. Confidence: 0.9",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a direct answer based on the image, but doesn't explicitly consider potential discrepancies between the question and the image content."
            },
            "MMCA Example": {
                "Input": "Image: A pizza on a plate. Question: What toppings are on the pizza?",
                "Step 1 Output": "Text analysis: The question asks about pizza toppings. Confidence: 1.0. Image analysis: I see a pizza with cheese, tomatoes, and basil. Confidence: 0.9.",
                "Step 2 Output": "The text and image are consistent. The question asks about pizza toppings, and the image clearly shows a pizza with identifiable toppings.",
                "Step 3 Output": "Final answer: The pizza has cheese, tomatoes, and basil as toppings. Recalibrated confidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "MMCA explicitly analyzes both the question and image, checks for coherence, and adjusts the confidence. The slight increase in confidence is due to the high coherence between the question and the image content."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MMCA doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why cross-modal coherence doesn't impact confidence as expected. We'll conduct ablation studies on different components of MMCA, such as varying the weight given to coherence in the recalibration step. We can also investigate how performance varies across different types of multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual QA vs. fact verification) to identify task-specific challenges. Additionally, we'll analyze the generated coherence assessments to understand if the model struggles with identifying cross-modal discrepancies, which could inform future research directions in improving multi-modal reasoning capabilities of LLMs."
