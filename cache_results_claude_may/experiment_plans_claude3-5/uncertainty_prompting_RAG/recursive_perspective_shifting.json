    "idea_name": "Recursive Perspective Shifting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple viewpoints or interpretations are possible.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like self-consistency sampling and confidence elicitation prompts provide limited insight into model uncertainty across different perspectives.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often evaluate their confidence by considering multiple angles and potential objections. We can potentially improve LLM uncertainty quantification by simulating this process of recursive perspective taking.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Perspective Shifting (RPS), a multi-step prompting method that iteratively generates contrasting viewpoints and rebuttals. The process begins with an initial response and confidence estimate. Then, we prompt the model to adopt a critical perspective and generate potential objections or alternative interpretations. Next, we have the model defend its original view against these objections. This process repeats for multiple rounds, with the model alternating between supportive and critical stances. At each step, we elicit updated confidence scores. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from analyzing the trajectory and stability of these scores across rounds.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate RPS against standard confidence elicitation and self-consistency baselines on multi-choice QA datasets that involve complex reasoning or ambiguous scenarios. Key metrics will include calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human-judged answer difficulty."

        "Title": "Recursive Perspective Shifting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple viewpoints or interpretations are possible. This issue is particularly pronounced in scenarios requiring nuanced understanding or where conflicting information exists.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like self-consistency sampling and confidence elicitation prompts provide limited insight into model uncertainty across different perspectives. Human experts often evaluate their confidence by considering multiple angles and potential objections. By simulating this process of recursive perspective taking, we can potentially improve LLM uncertainty quantification. This method could lead to more reliable and calibrated confidence estimates, which is crucial for deploying LLMs in high-stakes decision-making scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Perspective Shifting (RPS), a multi-step prompting method that iteratively generates contrasting viewpoints and rebuttals. The process begins with an initial response and confidence estimate. Then, we prompt the model to adopt a critical perspective and generate potential objections or alternative interpretations. Next, we have the model defend its original view against these objections. This process repeats for multiple rounds, with the model alternating between supportive and critical stances. At each step, we elicit updated confidence scores. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from analyzing the trajectory and stability of these scores across rounds.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-choice QA datasets that involve complex reasoning or ambiguous scenarios. Specifically, we'll use: 1) The AmbigQA dataset, which contains questions with multiple valid answers. 2) The TruthfulQA dataset, which includes questions designed to elicit false or uncertain responses. 3) A subset of the BIG-bench tasks focusing on reasoning and uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Standard confidence elicitation: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. b) Self-consistency sampling: Generate multiple responses and use their agreement as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: RPS Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Perspective Shifting method with the following steps: a) Initial response: Generate an initial answer and confidence score. b) Critical perspective: Prompt the model to generate potential objections or alternative viewpoints. c) Defense: Have the model defend its original answer against the objections. d) Repeat b) and c) for a set number of rounds (e.g., 3-5). e) At each step, elicit an updated confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Prompts Design": "Design prompts for each step of the RPS process. For example: a) Initial response: \"What is the answer to [QUESTION]? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.\" b) Critical perspective: \"Now, consider potential objections or alternative viewpoints to your answer. What are some strong arguments against your initial response?\" c) Defense: \"Given these objections, how would you defend your original answer? Update your confidence score if necessary.\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Confidence-error correlation: Calculate the correlation between model confidence and error rates. d) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. b) Run the RPS method with varying numbers of rounds (1, 3, 5) and collect results. c) For each method, generate at least 1000 samples to ensure statistical significance.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare the performance of RPS against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze how confidence scores change across rounds in RPS. c) Investigate cases where RPS significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines. d) Examine the quality and relevance of generated objections and defenses.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: a) Vary the number of RPS rounds. b) Remove the defense step and only use objections. c) Use different prompts for eliciting objections and defenses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of Australia? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of Australia is Canberra. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RPS; Round 1 - Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of Australia? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RPS; Round 1 - Initial Response)": "A: The capital of Australia is Canberra. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RPS; Round 1 - Critical Perspective)": "Now, consider potential objections or alternative viewpoints to your answer. What are some strong arguments against your initial response?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RPS; Round 1 - Critical Perspective)": "1. Many people mistakenly believe that Sydney or Melbourne is the capital of Australia due to their larger size and international recognition. 2. Canberra is a relatively small and less well-known city compared to other Australian cities, which might cause doubt. 3. The concept of a capital city can sometimes be ambiguous, as some countries have different cities serving as administrative, judicial, and legislative capitals.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RPS; Round 1 - Defense)": "Given these objections, how would you defend your original answer? Update your confidence score if necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RPS; Round 1 - Defense)": "While the objections raise valid points about common misconceptions, I stand by my original answer that Canberra is the capital of Australia. Here's why: 1. Canberra was purpose-built to serve as the national capital, chosen as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne. 2. It is the seat of the Australian Parliament and home to many important government institutions. 3. Its status as the capital is officially recognized and undisputed within Australia. However, given the potential for confusion among those less familiar with Australian geography, I'll slightly lower my confidence score. Updated confidence score: 90",
            "explanation": "The RPS method allows the model to consider potential objections and defend its answer, leading to a more nuanced confidence assessment. In this case, the model slightly lowered its confidence after considering common misconceptions, demonstrating improved calibration."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RPS method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated objections and defenses to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and limitations. 2) Explore variations of the RPS method, such as incorporating external knowledge sources for verification or using a separate model for generating objections. 3) Investigate whether RPS improves other aspects of model output, such as answer diversity or explanation quality, even if it doesn't directly improve calibration. 4) Analyze how different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. opinion-based) respond to RPS, which could lead to a more nuanced understanding of when and how to apply this method. 5) Compare RPS with other recent uncertainty quantification methods and analyze their relative strengths and weaknesses, potentially leading to a hybrid approach that combines the best aspects of multiple methods."
