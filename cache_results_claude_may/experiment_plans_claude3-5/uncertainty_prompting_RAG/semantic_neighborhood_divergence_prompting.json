        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with semantically ambiguous or context-dependent queries, leading to overconfident responses in cases where multiple interpretations are possible.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically rely on token-level probabilities or simple ensemble techniques, which may not capture semantic-level uncertainties effectively.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from the concept of semantic networks in cognitive science, we propose a method that explores the semantic neighborhood of a query to better quantify uncertainty arising from semantic ambiguity or context-dependence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Divergence Prompting (SNDP), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Semantic Expansion: The model is prompted to generate multiple semantically related variants of the original query, exploring different possible interpretations or contexts. 2) Divergence Analysis: The model then analyzes the responses to these variants, identifying areas of agreement and divergence. 3) Uncertainty Mapping: Based on the divergence analysis, the model creates a semantic uncertainty map, quantifying uncertainty for different aspects of the original query. 4) Calibrated Response Generation: Finally, the model generates a response to the original query, explicitly incorporating the semantic uncertainty map to produce a more nuanced and calibrated output.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SNDP on tasks involving semantic ambiguity, context-dependent reasoning, and open-ended question answering. Comparisons will be made against standard prompting techniques and other uncertainty quantification methods. Evaluation metrics will include semantic consistency scores, uncertainty calibration, and a novel metric we call 'semantic uncertainty resolution' to assess how well the model's uncertainty estimates capture semantic ambiguities."

        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Divergence Prompting: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Semantic Exploration",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with semantically ambiguous or context-dependent queries, leading to overconfident responses in cases where multiple interpretations are possible. Existing methods typically rely on token-level probabilities or simple ensemble techniques, which may not capture semantic-level uncertainties effectively. This research aims to develop a novel prompting method that can better quantify uncertainty and calibrate the confidence of LLMs by exploring the semantic neighborhood of a query.",
        "Motivation": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to capture the nuanced semantic ambiguities present in natural language. By drawing inspiration from semantic networks in cognitive science, we propose a method that explores the semantic neighborhood of a query to better quantify uncertainty arising from semantic ambiguity or context-dependence. This approach leverages the LLM's own semantic understanding to generate and analyze related interpretations, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Divergence Prompting (SNDP), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Semantic Expansion: The model is prompted to generate multiple semantically related variants of the original query, exploring different possible interpretations or contexts. 2) Divergence Analysis: The model then analyzes the responses to these variants, identifying areas of agreement and divergence. 3) Uncertainty Mapping: Based on the divergence analysis, the model creates a semantic uncertainty map, quantifying uncertainty for different aspects of the original query. 4) Calibrated Response Generation: Finally, the model generates a response to the original query, explicitly incorporating the semantic uncertainty map to produce a more nuanced and calibrated output.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve semantic ambiguity and context-dependent reasoning: 1) WinoGrande for coreference resolution, 2) AmbigQA for ambiguous question answering, and 3) COPA for commonsense causal reasoning. These datasets will be preprocessed to ensure compatibility with our prompting format.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct query to the LLM), 2) Monte Carlo Dropout (if applicable to the chosen LLM), and 3) Ensemble of differently prompted outputs. For each baseline, we'll use the LLM's output probabilities or ensemble variance as uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 3: SNDP Implementation": "Implement the four steps of SNDP: a) Semantic Expansion: Prompt the LLM to generate 5 semantically related variants of the original query. Example prompt: 'Generate 5 different ways to ask or interpret the following question, exploring potential ambiguities or context-dependencies: [ORIGINAL_QUERY]' b) Divergence Analysis: For each variant, generate an answer and compare it to the others. Prompt: 'Analyze the following answers to related questions. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement: [LIST_OF_ANSWERS]' c) Uncertainty Mapping: Create a semantic uncertainty map based on the divergence analysis. Prompt: 'Based on the previous analysis, create an uncertainty map for different aspects of the original query. Assign uncertainty scores from 0 (certain) to 1 (highly uncertain) for each aspect: [ORIGINAL_QUERY]' d) Calibrated Response Generation: Generate a final response incorporating the uncertainty map. Prompt: 'Provide a response to the following query, explicitly incorporating the uncertainty map to produce a nuanced and calibrated answer: [ORIGINAL_QUERY] Uncertainty Map: [UNCERTAINTY_MAP]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. For comparison, we'll also run experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude 2 from Anthropic.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration Error: Compare model confidence to empirical accuracy. 2) Semantic Consistency Score: Measure consistency across semantically related queries. 3) Uncertainty Resolution: Assess how well the model's uncertainty estimates align with human judgments of ambiguity (collected separately). 4) Task-specific performance metrics for each dataset (e.g., accuracy for WinoGrande, F1 score for AmbigQA).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results. b) Run SNDP method and collect results. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and SNDP.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform statistical analysis to compare SNDP against baselines: a) Conduct paired t-tests to assess significant differences in performance metrics. b) Analyze qualitative examples to understand when and how SNDP improves uncertainty quantification. c) Investigate the relationship between semantic neighborhood divergence and task difficulty or ambiguity."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too small. What is too small?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The suitcase is too small. In this sentence, 'it's' refers to the suitcase, not the trophy. If the trophy were too small, it would fit into the suitcase. Therefore, the suitcase must be the object that is too small to accommodate the trophy.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Semantic Expansion)": "Generate 5 different ways to ask or interpret the following question, exploring potential ambiguities or context-dependencies: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too small. What is too small?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Semantic Expansion)": "1. Which item is insufficient in size: the trophy or the suitcase?\n2. In the statement 'The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too small,' what does 'it' refer to?\n3. Is the problem with the size of the container or the contained object?\n4. What prevents the trophy from fitting into the suitcase: the trophy's size or the suitcase's size?\n5. In the context of a trophy and a suitcase, which one is described as being too small to allow proper storage?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Divergence Analysis)": "Analyze the following answers to related questions. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement: [Answers to the 5 questions from Step 1]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Divergence Analysis)": "Areas of Agreement:\n- All answers acknowledge that there's a size mismatch between the trophy and the suitcase.\n- Most responses recognize the ambiguity in the pronoun 'it'.\n\nAreas of Disagreement:\n- Some answers lean towards the suitcase being too small, while others maintain ambiguity.\n- There's variation in how directly the answers address the ambiguity versus providing a definitive answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Uncertainty Mapping)": "Based on the previous analysis, create an uncertainty map for different aspects of the original query. Assign uncertainty scores from 0 (certain) to 1 (highly uncertain) for each aspect: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too small. What is too small?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Uncertainty Mapping)": "Uncertainty Map:\n1. Referent of 'it': 0.8 (high uncertainty due to pronoun ambiguity)\n2. Size of the suitcase: 0.3 (low uncertainty, likely too small)\n3. Size of the trophy: 0.6 (moderate uncertainty, could be interpreted as too small)\n4. Cause of the fitting problem: 0.2 (low uncertainty, clearly a size mismatch)\n5. Intended meaning of the question: 0.7 (high uncertainty due to potential multiple interpretations)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Calibrated Response Generation)": "Provide a response to the following query, explicitly incorporating the uncertainty map to produce a nuanced and calibrated answer: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too small. What is too small? Uncertainty Map: [Output from Step 3]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Calibrated Response Generation)": "Based on the given information and our uncertainty analysis, we can provide a nuanced response:\n\nThe question 'What is too small?' in this context has a high degree of ambiguity (0.8 uncertainty) due to the unclear referent of 'it'. However, given the typical usage patterns and logical reasoning, it's more likely (0.7 confidence) that the suitcase is too small rather than the trophy. This interpretation aligns with the common understanding that if an object doesn't fit into a container, it's usually because the container is too small.\n\nThat said, there's still some uncertainty (0.3) regarding the size of the suitcase and moderate uncertainty (0.6) about the size of the trophy. Without additional context, we can't be entirely certain of the intended meaning.\n\nIn summary, while we lean towards interpreting that the suitcase is too small, we acknowledge the inherent ambiguity in the statement and the possibility of alternative interpretations.",
            "explanation": "The SNDP method provides a more nuanced and uncertainty-aware response compared to the baseline. It explicitly acknowledges the ambiguity in the question, quantifies the uncertainty for different aspects, and provides a calibrated response that reflects this uncertainty. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of the model's confidence and the inherent ambiguity in the query."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SNDP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the semantic neighborhoods generated by the model to gain insights into how LLMs represent and explore semantic spaces. This could lead to a paper on the semantic structures inherent in LLM representations. 2) Investigate how different prompting strategies affect the diversity and relevance of generated semantic variants. This could result in a study on prompt engineering for semantic exploration. 3) Analyze cases where SNDP performs poorly to identify limitations in the model's ability to recognize or reason about ambiguity. This could inform future work on improving LLMs' meta-cognitive capabilities. 4) Explore how SNDP performance varies across different types of queries or domains, potentially uncovering insights about the model's domain-specific uncertainty quantification abilities. 5) Investigate the relationship between semantic neighborhood divergence and factual correctness, which could lead to novel approaches for fact-checking or misinformation detection using LLMs."
