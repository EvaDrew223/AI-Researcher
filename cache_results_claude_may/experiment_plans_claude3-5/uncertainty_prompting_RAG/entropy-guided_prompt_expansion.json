    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide point estimates of confidence without capturing the full distribution of uncertainty, leading to oversimplified and potentially misleading uncertainty quantification.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically focus on single-point confidence estimates or limited sampling approaches.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring the model's response space through targeted prompt expansions, we can potentially capture a more comprehensive picture of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Entropy-Guided Prompt Expansion (EGPE), an iterative prompting technique that progressively expands the query space to maximize information gain about the model's uncertainty. Starting with the original query, we generate a series of follow-up prompts designed to probe areas of high entropy in the model's response distribution. These prompts are dynamically crafted to explore conflicting viewpoints, edge cases, and potential knowledge boundaries. We then aggregate the responses using a novel entropy-weighted confidence measure that captures both the central tendency and the dispersion of the model's beliefs. This approach allows for a more nuanced representation of uncertainty, potentially revealing multimodal or skewed confidence distributions.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate EGPE on diverse question-answering datasets, comparing it with standard confidence estimation techniques and more recent uncertainty quantification methods. We'll assess improvements in calibration, discrimination, and the ability to capture complex uncertainty distributions, particularly for queries with inherent ambiguity or multiple valid perspectives."

        "Title": "Entropy-Guided Prompt Expansion for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide point estimates of confidence without capturing the full distribution of uncertainty, leading to oversimplified and potentially misleading uncertainty quantification. This problem is particularly acute in complex reasoning tasks where the model's confidence may not align with its actual performance.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on single-point confidence estimates or limited sampling approaches, which fail to capture the nuanced landscape of model uncertainty. By systematically exploring the model's response space through targeted prompt expansions, we can potentially capture a more comprehensive picture of the model's uncertainty landscape. This approach is inspired by the concept of information entropy in information theory, where areas of high entropy represent greater uncertainty. By probing these high-entropy areas, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence distribution.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Entropy-Guided Prompt Expansion (EGPE), an iterative prompting technique that progressively expands the query space to maximize information gain about the model's uncertainty. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Initial query: Start with the original question. 2) Response generation: Generate multiple responses to the query. 3) Entropy calculation: Calculate the entropy of the response distribution. 4) Prompt expansion: Generate follow-up prompts designed to probe areas of high entropy. 5) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 for a set number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met. 6) Aggregation: Combine the responses using an entropy-weighted confidence measure that captures both the central tendency and the dispersion of the model's beliefs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use diverse question-answering datasets that require complex reasoning: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing model honesty, 2) MMLU for evaluating multi-task knowledge, and 3) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques: a) Direct confidence scoring, where the model is asked to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Monte Carlo Dropout, where multiple forward passes with dropout are used to estimate uncertainty. c) Ensemble methods, where predictions from multiple model instances are aggregated.",
            "Step 3: EGPE Implementation": "Implement the EGPE method as follows: a) For each question, generate an initial response and confidence score. b) Calculate the entropy of this initial response. c) Generate 3-5 follow-up prompts targeting areas of high entropy, e.g., 'What aspects of this question are you most uncertain about?', 'What additional information would help you answer more confidently?'. d) Generate responses to these follow-up prompts. e) Recalculate entropy based on all responses. f) Repeat steps c-e for 3 iterations or until entropy stabilizes. g) Aggregate all responses using an entropy-weighted mean.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare EGPE against baselines using the following metrics: a) Calibration error: measure the alignment between predicted probabilities and empirical outcomes. b) Brier score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Expected calibration error (ECE): measure the difference between confidence and accuracy. d) Area under the ROC curve (AUC): evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers across different confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of uncertainty estimates across different question types and difficulty levels. b) Examination of how entropy changes over iterations in EGPE. c) Analysis of the types of follow-up questions generated and their effectiveness in probing uncertainty. d) Investigation of cases where EGPE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (EGPE Step 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (EGPE Step 1)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (EGPE Step 2)": "What aspects of the question 'What is the capital of France?' are you most uncertain about?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (EGPE Step 2)": "I'm quite certain about this answer, but if there's any uncertainty, it might be about: 1) Whether the question is asking about the current capital or a historical capital. 2) If there's any recent geopolitical change I'm not aware of. 3) Whether 'capital' refers to the political capital or if there are other types of capitals (e.g., cultural capital) that might be different.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (EGPE Step 3)": "Based on your previous answers about the capital of France, provide a final answer with an explanation of your confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (EGPE Step 3)": "Final answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: Very high (approximately 0.99 out of 1). Explanation: I'm extremely confident in this answer because Paris has been the undisputed capital of France for centuries. It's a well-established fact that hasn't changed in recent history. The only minor sources of uncertainty, such as potential confusion about types of capitals or historical changes, are highly unlikely to affect the accuracy of this answer in the context of a straightforward question about the current capital.",
            "Explanation": "The EGPE method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's uncertainty. While the baseline method provides a single confidence score, EGPE probes potential sources of uncertainty and provides a more detailed explanation of the confidence level, potentially leading to more reliable uncertainty quantification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If EGPE does not show significant improvements over baselines, we will pivot our analysis to understand why. This could involve: 1) Examining the entropy patterns across iterations to see if we're effectively identifying areas of uncertainty. 2) Analyzing the quality and relevance of the generated follow-up questions. 3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or reasoning tasks benefit more from EGPE than others. 4) Exploring alternative aggregation methods for the multiple responses generated by EGPE. 5) Considering a hybrid approach that combines EGPE with other uncertainty quantification methods like ensemble techniques or calibration methods. Additionally, we could expand our study to include an analysis of how different prompting strategies affect uncertainty estimates, potentially leading to insights about the relationship between prompt design and model confidence."
