        "Problem": "Fixed confidence thresholds for decision-making or deferral often fail to account for task-specific difficulty and model capabilities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use predetermined confidence thresholds or rely on raw model probabilities for decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically establishing confidence thresholds through contrastive examples, we can create more adaptive and context-aware uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a contrastive prompting strategy: 1) For a given query, generate a set of contrastive examples by slightly modifying the query to create easier and harder variants. 2) Prompt the model to answer these contrastive examples along with the original query, providing confidence estimates for each. 3) Use the confidence distribution across the contrastive set to establish dynamic thresholds for high, medium, and low confidence specific to the current task and context. 4) Calibrate the model's confidence on the original query against these dynamic thresholds. 5) Optionally, use the contrastive examples to generate explanations for why certain variants are more or less certain than others.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate this method across a diverse set of tasks with varying difficulty levels. Compare against fixed threshold approaches and other dynamic calibration methods. Assess not only calibration metrics but also the method's ability to adapt to different task difficulties and its impact on decision-making or deferral strategies."

        "Title": "Dynamic Confidence Calibration through Contrastive Prompting for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Fixed confidence thresholds for decision-making or deferral in large language models (LLMs) often fail to account for task-specific difficulty and model capabilities, leading to suboptimal performance in uncertainty quantification and decision-making tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically use predetermined confidence thresholds or rely on raw model probabilities for decision-making, which can be unreliable across different tasks and contexts. By dynamically establishing confidence thresholds through contrastive examples, we can create more adaptive and context-aware uncertainty quantification. This method leverages the LLM's ability to compare and contrast similar examples, potentially leading to more nuanced and accurate confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a contrastive prompting strategy for dynamic confidence calibration: 1) For a given query, generate a set of contrastive examples by slightly modifying the query to create easier and harder variants. 2) Prompt the model to answer these contrastive examples along with the original query, providing confidence estimates for each. 3) Use the confidence distribution across the contrastive set to establish dynamic thresholds for high, medium, and low confidence specific to the current task and context. 4) Calibrate the model's confidence on the original query against these dynamic thresholds. 5) Optionally, use the contrastive examples to generate explanations for why certain variants are more or less certain than others.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) MMLU for multi-task language understanding. These datasets cover a range of task difficulties and domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Fixed threshold method: Use predetermined confidence thresholds (e.g., 0.7 for high confidence, 0.3-0.7 for medium, <0.3 for low) across all tasks. 2) Calibrated probabilities method: Use temperature scaling to calibrate raw model probabilities.",
            "Step 3: Contrastive Example Generation": "For each query in the datasets, generate 5 contrastive examples: 2 easier variants, 2 harder variants, and 1 similarly difficult variant. Use GPT-4 to generate these examples with the following prompt: 'Given the following question, generate 5 contrastive examples: 2 easier variants, 2 harder variants, and 1 similarly difficult variant. Original question: [INSERT QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Confidence Estimation": "For each original query and its contrastive examples, prompt the model (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) to provide an answer and a confidence estimate. Use the following prompt structure: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence estimate between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely uncertain and 1 is completely certain. Question: [INSERT QUESTION]'",
            "Step 5: Dynamic Threshold Establishment": "Use the confidence estimates from the contrastive examples to establish dynamic thresholds. Calculate the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of the confidence estimates. Set the thresholds as: High confidence: > \u03bc + 0.5\u03c3, Low confidence: < \u03bc - 0.5\u03c3, Medium confidence: between these two thresholds.",
            "Step 6: Confidence Calibration": "Calibrate the model's confidence on the original query against the dynamic thresholds established in Step 5. Assign the confidence level (high, medium, or low) based on where the original query's confidence estimate falls within these thresholds.",
            "Step 7: Optional Explanation Generation": "For queries where the confidence level differs from the baseline methods, prompt the model to generate an explanation. Use the following prompt: 'Explain why the confidence level for the original question [INSERT ORIGINAL QUESTION] differs from some of its variants [INSERT RELEVANT CONTRASTIVE EXAMPLES].'",
            "Step 8: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of our method against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Calculate the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for each method. 2) Decision quality: Measure the accuracy of decisions made based on confidence levels (e.g., answering high-confidence questions, deferring low-confidence ones). 3) Adaptability: Assess how well each method adapts to varying task difficulties within and across datasets.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Conduct an in-depth analysis of the results, focusing on: 1) How the dynamic thresholds vary across different types of questions and datasets. 2) The quality and usefulness of the generated explanations. 3) Cases where our method significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Fixed Threshold)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Fixed Threshold)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Calibrated Probabilities)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a calibrated probability between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Calibrated Probabilities)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Calibrated probability: 0.92",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Prompting; Step 1: Generate Contrastive Examples)": "Given the following question, generate 5 contrastive examples: 2 easier variants, 2 harder variants, and 1 similarly difficult variant. Original question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Prompting; Step 1: Generate Contrastive Examples)": "Easier variants:\n1. What is the capital of the United States?\n2. Which city is known as the 'City of Light' and is the capital of France?\nHarder variants:\n3. What was the capital of France during the Hundred Years' War?\n4. Which city became the de facto capital of France during the Nazi occupation in World War II?\nSimilarly difficult variant:\n5. What is the capital of Italy?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Prompting; Step 2: Confidence Estimation)": "Answer the following questions and provide a confidence estimate between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely uncertain and 1 is completely certain.\n1. What is the capital of France?\n2. What is the capital of the United States?\n3. Which city is known as the 'City of Light' and is the capital of France?\n4. What was the capital of France during the Hundred Years' War?\n5. Which city became the de facto capital of France during the Nazi occupation in World War II?\n6. What is the capital of Italy?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Prompting; Step 2: Confidence Estimation)": "1. The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 0.99\n2. The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C. Confidence: 0.99\n3. Paris is known as the 'City of Light' and is the capital of France. Confidence: 0.98\n4. The capital of France during the Hundred Years' War varied, but it was primarily Paris. However, other cities like Bourges also served as capitals at times. Confidence: 0.85\n5. Vichy became the de facto capital of France during the Nazi occupation in World War II. Confidence: 0.90\n6. The capital of Italy is Rome. Confidence: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Prompting; Step 3: Final Calibration)": "Based on the confidence estimates for the contrastive examples, calibrate the confidence for the original question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Prompting; Step 3: Final Calibration)": "The confidence estimates for the contrastive examples range from 0.85 to 0.99, with a mean of 0.95 and a standard deviation of 0.056. The confidence estimate for the original question (0.99) falls above the high confidence threshold (\u03bc + 0.5\u03c3 = 0.978). Therefore, the calibrated confidence level for 'What is the capital of France?' is High.",
            "explanation": "The contrastive prompting method allows for a more nuanced and context-aware confidence calibration. By generating and evaluating contrastive examples, we can establish dynamic thresholds that adapt to the specific task and context. This approach provides a more reliable confidence estimate compared to fixed thresholds or raw probabilities, as it takes into account the relative difficulty of the question within its domain."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed contrastive prompting method does not significantly improve confidence calibration or decision quality, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality and diversity of generated contrastive examples - are they truly capturing a range of difficulties? 2) The model's ability to provide consistent confidence estimates across similar questions - is there high variance that's undermining our method? 3) The effectiveness of our dynamic thresholding approach - would alternative methods for setting thresholds based on the contrastive set be more effective? Additionally, we could explore combining our method with existing calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could shift focus to analyzing how different types of questions and domains affect the model's confidence estimates, potentially uncovering insights about the model's strengths and weaknesses in different areas."
