        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in large language models often fail to capture the full spectrum of possible interpretations and their associated uncertainties, especially for ambiguous or context-dependent queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on producing a single uncertainty estimate or a discrete set of possibilities.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the principle of superposition in quantum mechanics, where a system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, we propose a method that allows language models to maintain and reason about multiple interpretations concurrently.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), a technique that encourages the model to generate and maintain multiple possible interpretations of a query simultaneously. The prompt instructs the model to think of itself as a quantum system, where each interpretation exists in superposition. The model is asked to generate several distinct 'quantum states' (interpretations), each with an associated 'amplitude' (probability). The model then 'interferes' these states by considering how they interact and influence each other, potentially leading to the emergence or cancellation of certain interpretations. Finally, the model performs a 'measurement' by collapsing the superposition into a final answer and uncertainty estimate, taking into account the interference patterns of the quantum states.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate QSP on tasks involving ambiguous queries, context-dependent interpretation, and creative problem-solving. We'll compare it to standard prompting techniques and other uncertainty quantification methods, measuring the diversity of generated interpretations, the quality of the final answers, and the calibration of uncertainty estimates. We'll also analyze the 'interference patterns' to gain insights into the model's reasoning process."

        "Title": "Quantum Superposition Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in large language models often fail to capture the full spectrum of possible interpretations and their associated uncertainties, especially for ambiguous or context-dependent queries. This limitation hinders the models' ability to provide accurate and comprehensive uncertainty estimates, which is crucial for reliable decision-making in various applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on producing a single uncertainty estimate or a discrete set of possibilities, which may not fully represent the complex nature of language understanding. Inspired by the principle of superposition in quantum mechanics, where a system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, we propose a method that allows language models to maintain and reason about multiple interpretations concurrently. This approach has the potential to capture a more nuanced and comprehensive view of uncertainty in language understanding tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), a technique that encourages the model to generate and maintain multiple possible interpretations of a query simultaneously. The process involves the following steps:\n1. Initial Superposition: The model is prompted to generate several distinct 'quantum states' (interpretations), each with an associated 'amplitude' (probability).\n2. Interference: The model is asked to consider how these states interact and influence each other, potentially leading to the emergence or cancellation of certain interpretations.\n3. Measurement: The model performs a 'measurement' by collapsing the superposition into a final answer and uncertainty estimate, taking into account the interference patterns of the quantum states.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate QSP:\n1. Ambiguous Queries Dataset: Compile a set of 1000 ambiguous questions from various domains (e.g., linguistics, general knowledge, current events).\n2. Context-Dependent Interpretation Dataset: Create a dataset of 1000 context-dependent questions, where the correct interpretation depends on additional context.\n3. Creative Problem-Solving Dataset: Develop a set of 500 open-ended problems that require creative thinking and multiple possible solutions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\n1. Standard prompting: Direct question-answering without uncertainty quantification.\n2. Monte Carlo Dropout: Use dropout at inference time to generate multiple outputs and estimate uncertainty.\n3. Ensemble of models: Use an ensemble of different model checkpoints or architectures to generate diverse outputs and estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: QSP Implementation": "Develop the QSP prompting technique:\n1. Design the initial superposition prompt: 'Generate 5 distinct interpretations of the following query, each with an associated probability: [QUERY]'\n2. Create the interference prompt: 'Consider how these interpretations might influence or contradict each other. Describe any emerging or cancelling interpretations.'\n3. Implement the measurement prompt: 'Based on the previous interpretations and their interactions, provide a final answer and an uncertainty estimate for the query.'\n4. Combine these prompts into a single, coherent QSP prompt template.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use the following models for our experiments:\n1. GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003)\n2. GPT-4\n3. Claude 2\n4. PaLM 2",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\n1. Run the baseline methods and collect their outputs and uncertainty estimates.\n2. Apply the QSP technique and collect the outputs, including intermediate interpretations and final answers with uncertainty estimates.\n3. Store all results in a structured format for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics:\n1. Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers for questions with definitive ground truths.\n2. Interpretation Diversity: Quantify the diversity of generated interpretations using metrics like cosine similarity or Jaccard distance.\n3. Uncertainty Calibration: Assess how well the model's uncertainty estimates align with its actual performance using calibration plots and expected calibration error (ECE).\n4. Human Evaluation: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the quality and relevance of the generated interpretations and final answers.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses:\n1. Compare the performance of QSP against baseline methods across all datasets and models.\n2. Analyze the relationship between the number of generated interpretations and the quality of the final answer and uncertainty estimate.\n3. Investigate how the interference step affects the final output and uncertainty quantification.\n4. Examine cases where QSP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines, and identify patterns or characteristics of these cases."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "What is the capital of Georgia?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The capital of Georgia is Atlanta.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (QSP)": "Generate 5 distinct interpretations of the following query, each with an associated probability: What is the capital of Georgia?\n\nNow, consider how these interpretations might influence or contradict each other. Describe any emerging or cancelling interpretations.\n\nBased on the previous interpretations and their interactions, provide a final answer and an uncertainty estimate for the query.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (QSP)": "Interpretations:\n1. The capital of the U.S. state of Georgia is Atlanta. (Probability: 0.4)\n2. The capital of the country Georgia is Tbilisi. (Probability: 0.4)\n3. The query is asking about the cultural or economic 'capital' of Georgia, which could be a city other than the official capital. (Probability: 0.1)\n4. The question might be referring to a historical capital of Georgia, either the state or the country. (Probability: 0.05)\n5. The query could be a trick question, as 'Georgia' might refer to something else entirely. (Probability: 0.05)\n\nInterference:\nThe first two interpretations are the most probable and directly contradict each other, as they refer to different entities named Georgia. The other interpretations are less likely but introduce additional uncertainty. The historical interpretation slightly reinforces both main interpretations, as it acknowledges the possibility of change over time.\n\nFinal Answer and Uncertainty Estimate:\nBased on the interpretations and their interactions, the answer is: The capital of Georgia is either Atlanta (if referring to the U.S. state) or Tbilisi (if referring to the country). Uncertainty estimate: High (0.8 on a scale of 0 to 1). This high uncertainty is due to the ambiguity in which Georgia is being referred to, and the equal probability of the two main interpretations. To provide a more certain answer, additional context about whether the query refers to the U.S. state or the country would be necessary.",
            "Explanation": "The QSP approach generates multiple interpretations and considers their interactions, leading to a more nuanced final answer that acknowledges the ambiguity in the question. It provides a high uncertainty estimate, reflecting the lack of clarity in the query. In contrast, the standard prompting approach gives a single, potentially incorrect answer without expressing any uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed QSP method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will pivot our analysis to understand why. We will examine the generated interpretations to assess their relevance and diversity. If the interpretations lack diversity or relevance, we may need to refine our prompting technique or explore ways to encourage more diverse thinking from the model. Additionally, we will analyze the interference step to see if it's effectively capturing the interactions between interpretations. If this step isn't adding value, we might consider alternative ways to combine or contrast the initial interpretations. We could also investigate whether certain types of queries or domains benefit more from QSP than others, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply this technique most effectively. Finally, if the overall approach doesn't yield the expected improvements, we could shift our focus to a comparative analysis of different uncertainty quantification methods across various types of language tasks, using the insights gained from our QSP experiments to inform this broader study."
