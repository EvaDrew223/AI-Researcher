    "idea_name": "Uncertainty Amplification via Cognitive Dissonance",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often express overconfidence in incorrect answers, failing to accurately reflect their uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often experience cognitive dissonance when faced with conflicting information, leading to increased uncertainty. By simulating this process in LLMs, we may be able to better calibrate their confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting strategy that intentionally introduces conflicting information to the model. First, we prompt the model to generate an initial answer and confidence score. Then, we inject contradictory evidence and ask the model to reassess its answer and confidence. We repeat this process multiple times with varying degrees of conflicting information, tracking how the model's confidence fluctuates. Finally, we aggregate these responses, weighing the confidence scores based on the degree of cognitive dissonance induced. This method aims to produce a more nuanced and realistic representation of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare our method against standard confidence estimation techniques on diverse question-answering datasets, evaluating calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score. Additionally, conduct human evaluation studies to assess the perceived reliability of the model's expressed uncertainty."

        "Title": "Cognitive Dissonance Prompting: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Conflicting Information",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often express overconfidence in incorrect answers, failing to accurately reflect their uncertainty. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in complex reasoning tasks. Current calibration methods struggle to capture nuanced uncertainties, necessitating a more sophisticated approach to quantify and adjust model confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like temperature scaling and ensemble techniques often fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks. These approaches typically apply uniform adjustments to confidence scores, which may not accurately reflect the varying degrees of uncertainty across different types of questions or contexts. Our proposed method draws inspiration from human cognitive processes, specifically the concept of cognitive dissonance. When humans encounter conflicting information, they often experience increased uncertainty and a need to reassess their beliefs. By simulating this process in LLMs, we aim to produce a more realistic and nuanced representation of model uncertainty, leading to better-calibrated confidence scores.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting strategy that intentionally introduces conflicting information to the model, simulating cognitive dissonance. The process involves: 1) Initial response: Prompt the model to generate an initial answer and confidence score. 2) Conflicting information injection: Introduce contradictory evidence or alternative viewpoints. 3) Reassessment: Ask the model to reassess its answer and confidence in light of the new information. 4) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-3 multiple times with varying degrees of conflicting information. 5) Aggregation: Combine the multiple responses, weighing the confidence scores based on the degree of cognitive dissonance induced. This method aims to produce a more nuanced and realistic representation of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of topics and difficulty levels. We will use: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and resistance to misinformation, 2) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for evaluating performance across various academic and professional domains, and 3) ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) for testing scientific reasoning abilities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: 1) Direct prompting: Ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: Apply different temperature values (e.g., 0.5, 0.7, 1.0) to adjust output probabilities. 3) Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to create an ensemble prediction.",
            "Step 3: Cognitive Dissonance Prompting Implementation": "Develop the multi-step prompting strategy: 1) Initial prompt: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' 2) Conflicting information prompt: 'Consider the following contradictory information: [CONFLICTING_INFO]. How does this affect your answer and confidence?' 3) Reassessment prompt: 'Given this new information, please provide your updated answer and confidence score.' 4) Repeat steps 2-3 with varying degrees of conflicting information (e.g., slightly contradictory, strongly contradictory, tangentially related).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible for research purposes.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset: 1) Run baseline methods on all questions. 2) Apply the Cognitive Dissonance Prompting method, using 3 iterations of conflicting information injection. 3) Record all intermediate and final answers, along with confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "1) Calculate calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score for both baseline methods and the proposed method. 2) Compute accuracy scores for each method. 3) Analyze the change in confidence scores across iterations of the Cognitive Dissonance Prompting method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of the Cognitive Dissonance Prompting method against baselines using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. 2) Analyze how different types of conflicting information affect confidence calibration. 3) Investigate the relationship between the degree of cognitive dissonance induced and the accuracy of the final answer.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "1) Vary the number of conflicting information iterations (1, 3, 5) to determine the optimal number. 2) Experiment with different aggregation methods for combining multiple reassessments (e.g., simple averaging, weighted averaging based on confidence, taking the minimum confidence).",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Manually review a subset of examples where the Cognitive Dissonance Prompting method significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. Identify patterns or characteristics of questions that benefit most from this approach."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Conflicting Information)": "Consider the following contradictory information: 'In a recent news article, it was reported that the French government is considering moving the capital to Marseille due to overcrowding in Paris.' How does this affect your answer and confidence?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Conflicting Information)": "This information is surprising and contradicts my previous knowledge. While it's possible that there might be discussions about moving the capital, such a significant change would typically be widely known and verified. Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, and moving the capital would be a major political and logistical undertaking. However, I should consider this new information and adjust my confidence accordingly.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Reassessment)": "Given this new information, please provide your updated answer and confidence score for the question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Reassessment)": "A: The capital of France is still Paris. However, given the conflicting information about potential plans to move the capital, I've reduced my confidence. Confidence score: 85",
            "Explanation": "The Cognitive Dissonance Prompting method leads to a more nuanced and cautious response. While the model maintains that Paris is the capital, it acknowledges the possibility of change and reduces its confidence accordingly. This demonstrates improved uncertainty quantification compared to the initial overconfident response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the Cognitive Dissonance Prompting method doesn't significantly improve calibration metrics, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of how different types of conflicting information affect model responses. This could lead to insights about what kinds of information are most effective at inducing uncertainty in LLMs. 2) Investigate the relationship between the model's initial confidence and its susceptibility to conflicting information. This could reveal patterns in when and how LLMs are most likely to reassess their confidence. 3) Explore combining our method with existing calibration techniques, such as using Cognitive Dissonance Prompting to generate a distribution of responses, then applying temperature scaling or ensemble methods to this distribution. 4) Analyze the linguistic patterns in the model's explanations during the reassessment phase. This could provide insights into the reasoning processes of LLMs when faced with conflicting information. 5) If the method proves more effective for certain types of questions or domains, we could focus on developing specialized cognitive dissonance prompts for those areas, potentially creating a more targeted calibration approach."
