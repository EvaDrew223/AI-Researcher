        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with incrementally eroded or manipulated premises in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically eroding key premises and observing how model confidence changes, we can gain insights into the model's underlying reasoning process and calibrate its confidence more accurately.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique called Premise Erosion Prompting (PEP). Given a complex reasoning task, PEP systematically generates a series of prompts with incrementally eroded or manipulated premises. The model is then asked to solve the task and provide a confidence score for each variant. By analyzing the pattern of confidence changes across these eroded premises, we can calibrate the model's overall confidence and identify critical reasoning steps. The prompt structure includes: 1) Original task description, 2) Systematically eroded premises, 3) Solution request, and 4) Confidence elicitation for each variant.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate PEP against standard confidence elicitation techniques on datasets like MMLU and BigBench, focusing on tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Measure improvements in calibration error and correlation between confidence and accuracy across premise erosion levels."

        "Title": "Premise Erosion Prompting: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Systematic Premise Manipulation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with incrementally eroded or manipulated premises in complex reasoning tasks. This issue can lead to overconfident responses in situations where the model's knowledge is incomplete or uncertain, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making based on the model's output.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence calibration in language models typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration techniques. However, these approaches may not fully capture the nuances of how model confidence changes as key premises are systematically altered. By introducing a novel prompting technique that systematically erodes key premises and observes how model confidence changes, we can gain deeper insights into the model's underlying reasoning process and calibrate its confidence more accurately. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to improve its metacognition, potentially leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Premise Erosion Prompting (PEP), a novel prompting technique for calibrating confidence in large language models. Given a complex reasoning task, PEP systematically generates a series of prompts with incrementally eroded or manipulated premises. The model is then asked to solve the task and provide a confidence score for each variant. The prompt structure includes: 1) Original task description, 2) Systematically eroded premises, 3) Solution request, and 4) Confidence elicitation for each variant.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select tasks from MMLU and BigBench that require multi-step reasoning. Focus on domains such as science, logic, and mathematics. Create a subset of 100-200 questions for each domain.",
            "Step 2: Premise Erosion Generation": "For each question, manually create 3-5 variants with incrementally eroded premises. Ensure that the erosions target key information needed for correct reasoning.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Template Design": "Create a prompt template that includes: a) The original question, b) Eroded premise variants, c) Instructions for the model to solve each variant and provide a confidence score (0-100%).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo as the primary models for evaluation. Also include open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Baseline Prompting": "Implement standard prompting methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting, b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, c) Few-shot CoT prompting.",
            "Step 6: PEP Implementation": "Apply the PEP method to each question in the dataset. For each erosion level, prompt the model to solve the task and provide a confidence score.",
            "Step 7: Data Collection": "Collect model outputs for both baseline methods and PEP. Store the answers, reasoning steps (if applicable), and confidence scores for each variant.",
            "Step 8: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Accuracy, b) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), c) Confidence-accuracy correlation, d) Area Under the Confidence-Accuracy Curve.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Compare PEP results against baselines. Analyze how confidence changes across erosion levels and its correlation with accuracy. Identify patterns in premise importance and model behavior.",
            "Step 10: Confidence Calibration": "Develop a calibration method based on the PEP results. This could involve adjusting the model's raw confidence scores based on observed patterns in premise erosion responses.",
            "Step 11: Validation": "Apply the calibrated confidence scores to a held-out test set and evaluate the improvement in calibration metrics.",
            "Step 12: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of PEP, such as the number of erosion levels, the order of premise erosions, and the specific wording of confidence elicitation prompts."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: A car travels 120 miles in 2 hours. What is its average speed in miles per hour?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The average speed of the car is 60 miles per hour. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PEP)": "Original Question: A car travels 120 miles in 2 hours. What is its average speed in miles per hour?\n\nVariant 1: A car travels some distance in 2 hours. What is its average speed in miles per hour?\nVariant 2: A car travels 120 miles in some amount of time. What is its average speed in miles per hour?\nVariant 3: A car travels. What is its average speed in miles per hour?\n\nFor each variant, provide your answer and a confidence score (0-100%). Explain your reasoning for each confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PEP)": "Original Question: The average speed is 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour. Confidence: 100%\n\nVariant 1: Without knowing the distance, it's impossible to calculate the exact speed. Confidence: 0%\n\nVariant 2: We know the distance but not the time, so we can't calculate the speed. However, we know it's a car, so we can estimate a reasonable range. Confidence: 20%\n\nVariant 3: With no specific information about distance or time, we can only guess based on typical car speeds. Confidence: 5%\n\nExplanation: My confidence decreases as more critical information is removed. In the original question, all necessary information is provided, hence 100% confidence. In Variant 1, missing the distance makes the calculation impossible. In Variant 2, we can make an educated guess based on typical car speeds, but it's still very uncertain. In Variant 3, we have almost no information to work with, resulting in very low confidence.",
            "Explanation": "PEP allows the model to demonstrate how its confidence changes as key premises are eroded. This provides insight into the model's reasoning process and helps identify which pieces of information are critical for confident answers."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PEP doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why the method didn't work as expected. We could investigate patterns in how models respond to premise erosion, potentially uncovering insights about their reasoning processes. Additionally, we could explore alternative ways of using the premise erosion data, such as training a separate confidence prediction model based on the patterns observed in PEP responses. Another approach could be to combine PEP with other calibration methods, such as temperature scaling or ensemble techniques, to see if there are synergistic effects. Finally, we could expand the study to include more diverse tasks and model architectures to gain a broader understanding of how different types of models handle premise erosion."
