        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately assess their confidence when faced with slightly altered versions of questions they can answer correctly, leading to overconfidence in incorrect responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or comparing multiple model outputs, but struggle with subtle variations that should affect confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By generating and evaluating counterfactual versions of the original question, we can probe the model's robustness and calibrate its confidence more accurately.",
        "Proposed Method": "Counterfactual Confidence Estimation involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) Answer the original question. 2) Generate 3-5 counterfactual versions of the question by slightly altering key details. 3) Answer each counterfactual question. 4) Compare the original answer with counterfactual answers, analyzing how changes affect the response. 5) Provide a final confidence score based on the consistency and robustness of answers across counterfactuals. The prompt guides the LLM to consider how small changes impact its certainty, leading to more nuanced confidence estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on question-answering datasets like TriviaQA and Natural Questions, comparing against baselines of direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods. Measure performance using calibration metrics (ECE, Brier Score) and assess the method's ability to identify subtle question variations that should reduce confidence."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Estimation: Calibrating LLM Uncertainty through Multi-Step Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately assess their confidence when faced with slightly altered versions of questions they can answer correctly, leading to overconfidence in incorrect responses. This problem is particularly acute in scenarios where subtle changes in the input should significantly affect the model's certainty, but don't. Addressing this issue is crucial for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or comparing multiple model outputs. However, these approaches struggle with subtle variations that should affect confidence. Our proposed method, Counterfactual Confidence Estimation, is inspired by human reasoning processes where we consider alternative scenarios to gauge our certainty. By generating and evaluating counterfactual versions of the original question, we can probe the model's robustness and calibrate its confidence more accurately. This approach leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to perform a more nuanced assessment of its knowledge and uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "Counterfactual Confidence Estimation involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) Answer the original question. 2) Generate 3-5 counterfactual versions of the question by slightly altering key details. 3) Answer each counterfactual question. 4) Compare the original answer with counterfactual answers, analyzing how changes affect the response. 5) Provide a final confidence score based on the consistency and robustness of answers across counterfactuals. The prompt guides the LLM to consider how small changes impact its certainty, leading to more nuanced confidence estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use question-answering datasets like TriviaQA and Natural Questions. Select a subset of 1000 questions from each dataset for evaluation. Ensure a mix of easy and challenging questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Ensemble method: Generate multiple answers using different temperature settings and calculate confidence based on consistency.",
            "Step 3: Counterfactual Confidence Estimation Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of the process: 1) Answer generation, 2) Counterfactual question generation, 3) Counterfactual answer generation, 4) Comparison and analysis, 5) Final confidence scoring.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Run both baseline methods. b) Run the Counterfactual Confidence Estimation method. c) Store all intermediate outputs (original answers, counterfactuals, analyses) along with final confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Measure performance using calibration metrics (Expected Calibration Error, Brier Score) and assess the method's ability to identify subtle question variations that should reduce confidence. Compare results of the proposed method against baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a qualitative analysis of cases where Counterfactual Confidence Estimation significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. Examine the generated counterfactuals and analyses to understand the method's strengths and weaknesses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first president of the United States?\nA: George Washington\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Expected Output": "I am 100% confident in my answer that George Washington was the first president of the United States.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly elicits confidence without considering potential variations or uncertainties."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Step 1 - Original Answer": {
                    "Input": "Q: Who was the first president of the United States?",
                    "Output": "A: George Washington was the first president of the United States."
                },
                "Step 2 - Generate Counterfactuals": {
                    "Input": "Generate 3 counterfactual versions of the question 'Who was the first president of the United States?' by slightly altering key details:",
                    "Output": "1. Who was the first president of the Confederate States of America?\n2. Who was the first vice president of the United States?\n3. Who was the second president of the United States?"
                },
                "Step 3 - Answer Counterfactuals": {
                    "Input": "Please answer each of these questions:\n1. Who was the first president of the Confederate States of America?\n2. Who was the first vice president of the United States?\n3. Who was the second president of the United States?",
                    "Output": "1. Jefferson Davis was the first and only president of the Confederate States of America.\n2. John Adams was the first vice president of the United States.\n3. John Adams was the second president of the United States."
                },
                "Step 4 - Compare and Analyze": {
                    "Input": "Compare the original answer 'George Washington was the first president of the United States' with the counterfactual answers. Analyze how the changes in the questions affected the responses:",
                    "Output": "The original answer remains consistent and distinct from the counterfactual answers. Each counterfactual question resulted in a different answer, demonstrating that the model can distinguish between similar but distinct roles and time periods in early American history. This suggests a robust understanding of the topic."
                },
                "Step 5 - Final Confidence Score": {
                    "Input": "Based on the original answer and the analysis of counterfactual questions, provide a final confidence score (0-100) for the statement 'George Washington was the first president of the United States.' Explain your reasoning.",
                    "Output": "Final Confidence Score: 98/100\n\nReasoning: The high confidence score is based on several factors:\n1. The model consistently identified George Washington as the first U.S. president in the original question.\n2. The model correctly distinguished between similar roles (president vs. vice president) and different entities (United States vs. Confederate States).\n3. The model demonstrated knowledge of the chronological order of presidents (identifying John Adams as the second president).\n\nThe slight reduction from 100 to 98 acknowledges the inherent possibility of error in any historical claim, even one as well-established as this. However, the consistent and accurate responses across related questions strongly support the original answer's validity."
                },
                "Explanation": "The Counterfactual Confidence Estimation method provides a more nuanced confidence assessment by considering related scenarios and analyzing the model's responses to slight variations in the question. This approach allows for a more robust evaluation of the model's understanding and certainty."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Counterfactual Confidence Estimation method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand why they didn't lead to improved calibration. This might involve categorizing the types of counterfactuals generated and their effectiveness in probing model uncertainty. Second, we could explore combining our method with existing calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Third, we might investigate whether the method performs differently across various types of questions or domains, potentially uncovering specific areas where counterfactual reasoning is particularly effective or ineffective for confidence estimation. Lastly, we could shift focus to use the generated counterfactuals and analyses as a tool for explaining model confidence, even if they don't directly improve calibration metrics. This could turn the project into an explainable AI study, examining how counterfactual reasoning can provide insights into model decision-making and uncertainty."
