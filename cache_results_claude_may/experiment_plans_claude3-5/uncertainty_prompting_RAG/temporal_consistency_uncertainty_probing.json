        "Problem": "LLMs may produce inconsistent responses over time or across different prompts, indicating underlying uncertainty that is not captured by single-shot confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current methods focus on estimating uncertainty from a single model query, potentially missing temporal inconsistencies.",
        "Motivation": "Consistent responses across time and slight prompt variations likely indicate higher certainty, while inconsistencies may reveal underlying uncertainties not captured by traditional methods.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Consistency Uncertainty Probing, which estimates uncertainty by analyzing response consistency over time and prompt variations: 1) Generate multiple responses to the same query over a series of time steps, with slight prompt variations. 2) Analyze the consistency of these responses using semantic similarity measures. 3) Prompt the model to explain any inconsistencies between its responses. 4) Synthesize an uncertainty estimate based on the degree of response consistency and the model's explanations for inconsistencies. This method captures uncertainty that manifests as response instability over time or across slight contextual changes.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate this method on tasks prone to temporal inconsistency, such as open-ended generation and multi-step reasoning. Metrics will include measures of response stability over time, correlation between stability and task performance, and comparisons with traditional single-shot uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Uncertainty Probing: Quantifying LLM Uncertainty through Response Stability",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent responses over time or across different prompts, indicating underlying uncertainty that is not captured by single-shot confidence estimates. This inconsistency can lead to unreliable outputs and hinder the deployment of LLMs in critical applications where consistent and reliable responses are crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for estimating LLM uncertainty primarily focus on single-model queries, potentially missing temporal inconsistencies and variations across slight prompt changes. Our approach is inspired by the observation that consistent responses across time and minor prompt variations likely indicate higher certainty, while inconsistencies may reveal underlying uncertainties not captured by traditional methods. By analyzing response stability over time and across prompt variations, we can develop a more comprehensive and robust measure of LLM uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Consistency Uncertainty Probing (TCUP), a method that estimates uncertainty by analyzing response consistency over time and prompt variations. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Generate multiple responses to the same query over a series of time steps, with slight prompt variations. 2) Analyze the consistency of these responses using semantic similarity measures. 3) Prompt the model to explain any inconsistencies between its responses. 4) Synthesize an uncertainty estimate based on the degree of response consistency and the model's explanations for inconsistencies.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets for open-ended generation and multi-step reasoning tasks. We will use the following datasets: a) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, b) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and c) CommonGen for open-ended text generation.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement traditional single-shot uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: a) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature values (0.5, 0.7, 1.0) and compare output probabilities. b) Entropy of output distribution: Calculate the entropy of the token probability distribution for the generated responses.",
            "Step 4: TCUP Implementation": "Implement the TCUP method with the following sub-steps: a) Generate 5 responses for each query, with a 1-hour interval between generations. b) Create 3 slight variations of each prompt by adding irrelevant information or rephrasing. c) Use SentenceBERT to calculate semantic similarity between responses. d) Prompt the model to explain inconsistencies between responses. e) Synthesize an uncertainty score based on response consistency and explanations.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Response stability: Average semantic similarity between responses. b) Uncertainty score correlation: Correlation between TCUP uncertainty scores and task performance. c) Comparison with baselines: Measure improvement over traditional single-shot uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Experiments": "Run experiments on the selected datasets: a) Generate responses and calculate uncertainty scores using both baseline methods and TCUP. b) Evaluate the performance of each method using the defined metrics. c) Analyze the relationship between uncertainty scores and task performance.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: a) Compare TCUP uncertainty scores with baseline methods. b) Analyze the effectiveness of TCUP across different task types. c) Investigate the impact of time intervals and prompt variations on uncertainty estimates. d) Examine the model's explanations for inconsistencies and their correlation with uncertainty scores."

                "Model Explanation": "The responses are consistent because they all provide the same numerical answer (150 miles) and use similar reasoning based on the given speed and time.",

                "Explanation": "TCUP generates multiple responses over time, analyzes their consistency, and provides a low uncertainty score due to high semantic similarity and consistent numerical answers. This method captures the model's stability in answering this particular question, providing a more comprehensive uncertainty estimate than the baseline method."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCUP method does not significantly outperform baseline uncertainty estimation techniques, we will pivot our analysis to understand why. We will investigate the following aspects: 1) Analyze the types of questions where TCUP performs well or poorly compared to baselines. 2) Examine the relationship between semantic similarity and actual answer correctness. 3) Investigate the impact of different time intervals on response consistency. 4) Analyze the model's explanations for inconsistencies to gain insights into its reasoning process. 5) Explore alternative semantic similarity measures and their impact on uncertainty estimation. 6) Investigate the relationship between prompt variations and response consistency. This analysis could lead to insights about the nature of LLM uncertainty and potentially inform the development of improved uncertainty estimation techniques or reveal interesting patterns in LLM behavior over time and across slight context changes."
