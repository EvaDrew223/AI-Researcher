        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often fail to capture the complexity and nuance of real-world knowledge domains, where multiple valid perspectives or interpretations may exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-perspective confidence scores or simplistic ensemble methods, which may not adequately represent the multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in complex domains.",
        "Motivation": "In academic and professional settings, uncertainty is often explored through debate and discussion among experts with different perspectives. We propose that simulating this process within an LLM can lead to more comprehensive and nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Debate Simulation (MPDS), a prompting technique that engages the LLM in a simulated debate to explore and quantify uncertainty. Given a question or statement, MPDS prompts the model to assume multiple distinct expert personas, each with a different background or perspective relevant to the topic. These personas engage in a structured debate, presenting arguments, counter-arguments, and rebuttals. For example, on a question about climate change impacts, MPDS might simulate a debate between a climate scientist, an economist, and a policy maker. The model is prompted to provide confidence scores and key points for each perspective, as well as meta-commentary on the overall certainty of the debate's conclusions. By analyzing the diversity of viewpoints, the strength and consistency of arguments, and the model's meta-evaluation of the debate, MPDS provides a rich, multi-dimensional uncertainty quantification that captures the complexity of real-world knowledge domains.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MPDS on a range of complex, multi-faceted topics drawn from fields such as science, philosophy, and public policy. Performance will be measured using novel metrics designed to capture the nuance and dimensionality of uncertainty in these domains, as well as traditional calibration metrics. We will compare MPDS to baseline single-perspective and ensemble methods, with a particular focus on how well each method captures the complexity and potential validity of multiple viewpoints."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of complex, multi-faceted questions from fields such as science, philosophy, and public policy. Sources can include academic journals, policy papers, and expert forums. Aim for 100-200 questions that require nuanced understanding and have potential for multiple valid perspectives.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Single-perspective confidence scoring: Directly ask the LLM to answer the question and provide a confidence score. (2) Simple ensemble method: Generate multiple independent answers and aggregate their confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: MPDS Implementation": "Develop the MPDS prompting technique with the following components: (a) Expert persona generation: Prompt the LLM to identify 3-5 relevant expert personas for each question. (b) Debate simulation: Structure a multi-turn debate where each persona presents arguments, responds to others, and refines their position. (c) Confidence scoring: Prompt each persona to provide a confidence score and key points. (d) Meta-evaluation: Ask the LLM to summarize the debate and provide an overall uncertainty assessment.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metric Design": "Develop novel metrics to capture the nuance and dimensionality of uncertainty: (a) Perspective Diversity Score: Measure the variety and distinctiveness of viewpoints presented. (b) Argument Strength Consistency: Assess the coherence and consistency of arguments across turns. (c) Confidence Distribution: Analyze the distribution of confidence scores across personas. (d) Meta-Uncertainty Score: Evaluate the LLM's ability to synthesize and quantify overall uncertainty.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: (a) Apply both baseline methods and record their outputs and confidence scores. (b) Execute the MPDS technique, recording the full debate transcript, individual persona confidence scores, and meta-evaluation. (c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for both baselines and MPDS.",
            "Step 6: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare MPDS to baseline methods across all evaluation metrics. Conduct statistical tests to determine significant differences in performance. Analyze specific cases where MPDS outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Select a subset of 50 questions and their corresponding outputs from all methods. Recruit domain experts to rate the quality, comprehensiveness, and accuracy of uncertainty quantification for each method.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of MPDS: (a) Vary the number of expert personas. (b) Adjust the number of debate turns. (c) Remove the meta-evaluation step.",
            "Step 9: Results Compilation and Interpretation": "Synthesize all quantitative and qualitative results. Identify key strengths and limitations of MPDS compared to baselines. Discuss implications for improving uncertainty quantification in LLMs."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-perspective)": "Q: What will be the long-term economic impact of artificial intelligence on global employment? Please provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-perspective)": "A: The long-term economic impact of artificial intelligence on global employment will likely be mixed. While AI will automate many jobs, particularly in manufacturing and routine cognitive tasks, it will also create new job opportunities in AI development, maintenance, and industries we can't yet foresee. There will likely be significant short-term disruption and unemployment in certain sectors, but over time, the economy is expected to adapt with new jobs emerging. However, this transition may exacerbate income inequality if not managed carefully through education and retraining programs. Confidence score: 75/100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Ensemble)": "Q: What will be the long-term economic impact of artificial intelligence on global employment? Please provide 3 independent answers, each with a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Ensemble)": "Answer 1: AI will lead to widespread job losses across multiple sectors, causing long-term structural unemployment. Confidence: 60/100\nAnswer 2: AI will create more jobs than it destroys, leading to economic growth and new opportunities. Confidence: 70/100\nAnswer 3: The impact will be neutral, with job losses in some areas offset by gains in others. Confidence: 65/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPDS; Step 1: Expert Persona Generation)": "Q: What will be the long-term economic impact of artificial intelligence on global employment? Please identify 3-5 relevant expert personas who would have informed perspectives on this question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPDS; Step 1: Expert Persona Generation)": "1. AI Researcher specializing in machine learning and its applications\n2. Labor Economist focusing on technological unemployment\n3. Industry Executive from a major tech company developing AI solutions\n4. Policy Maker specializing in workforce development and education",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPDS; Step 2: Debate Simulation)": "Simulate a debate between the identified expert personas on the question: What will be the long-term economic impact of artificial intelligence on global employment? Each persona should present their initial argument, respond to others, and refine their position over 3 turns.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPDS; Step 2: Debate Simulation)": "[A detailed debate transcript with arguments and counter-arguments from each persona over 3 turns]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPDS; Step 3: Confidence Scoring)": "For each expert persona in the debate, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 on their final position, along with 2-3 key points supporting their view.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPDS; Step 3: Confidence Scoring)": "AI Researcher: Confidence 80/100\nKey points:\n- AI will automate many current jobs but create new ones in AI development and maintenance\n- The net effect on employment will be positive in the long term\n- Significant retraining and education initiatives will be necessary\n\n[Similar outputs for other personas]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPDS; Step 4: Meta-evaluation)": "Based on the simulated debate, provide an overall assessment of the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic impact of AI on global employment. Discuss areas of consensus, major points of contention, and overall confidence in our ability to predict this impact.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPDS; Step 4: Meta-evaluation)": "Overall, there is significant uncertainty about the long-term economic impact of AI on global employment. Areas of consensus include the expectation of short-term disruption in certain sectors and the need for adaptive policies and education. Major points of contention revolve around the net effect on job creation vs. destruction and the timeline for economic adaptation. Given the complexity of the issue and the rapidly evolving nature of AI technology, our overall confidence in predicting this impact is moderate (65/100). The debate highlights the need for ongoing research, flexible policy approaches, and consideration of multiple scenarios in planning for the future of work.",
            "explanation": "MPDS provides a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the uncertainty surrounding the question. By simulating a debate among multiple expert personas, it captures diverse perspectives, areas of agreement and disagreement, and a more detailed assessment of the confidence levels associated with different viewpoints. This approach offers a richer understanding of the complexity and multi-faceted nature of the uncertainty compared to the single-perspective or simple ensemble baselines."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MPDS method does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of the debate transcripts to identify patterns in how LLMs reason about uncertainty across different domains. This could provide valuable insights into the model's strengths and limitations in handling complex, multi-faceted questions. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from MPDS than others, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the method. 3) Explore variations of the MPDS technique, such as incorporating external knowledge sources into the debate or experimenting with different debate structures (e.g., adversarial vs. collaborative debates). 4) Analyze the meta-evaluations to understand how LLMs synthesize conflicting viewpoints, which could inform future research on improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities. 5) Develop a new metric or framework for evaluating uncertainty quantification in LLMs based on the insights gained from the MPDS experiments, even if the method itself doesn't outperform baselines in all cases."
