        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with semantically similar but distinct concepts or scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on token-level probabilities or simple consistency checks across multiple generations.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly contrasting semantically related scenarios, we can better probe the model's understanding of subtle distinctions and associated uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Semantic Uncertainty Mapping, a method that generates pairs of semantically related but distinct prompts to probe the model's uncertainty. For a given query, we first generate several semantically similar variants using the model itself. We then prompt the model with pairs of these variants, asking it to compare and contrast them, highlighting key differences and similarities. For each comparison, the model is asked to provide confidence estimates for various aspects of its analysis. By mapping out these contrastive relationships and associated confidences, we create a semantic uncertainty landscape that captures nuanced uncertainties in the model's understanding. We aggregate this information using a graph-based algorithm to produce a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for semantic relationships.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on tasks requiring fine-grained semantic understanding, such as nuanced classification tasks, entailment problems, and complex reasoning scenarios. We'll compare against baseline uncertainty estimation methods using metrics like AUC-ROC for uncertainty-based error detection and a new metric we'll develop for semantic uncertainty coherence."

        "Title": "Contrastive Semantic Uncertainty Mapping: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with semantically similar but distinct concepts or scenarios. This leads to overconfident predictions in ambiguous situations and unreliable uncertainty estimates, which can be problematic in critical applications requiring robust decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods for language models typically rely on token-level probabilities or simple consistency checks across multiple generations. These approaches often fail to capture nuanced semantic differences that humans can easily distinguish. By explicitly contrasting semantically related scenarios, we can better probe the model's understanding of subtle distinctions and associated uncertainties. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often clarify our understanding by comparing and contrasting related concepts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Semantic Uncertainty Mapping (CSUM), a method that generates pairs of semantically related but distinct prompts to probe the model's uncertainty. The process involves: 1) For a given query, generate several semantically similar variants using the model itself. 2) Prompt the model with pairs of these variants, asking it to compare and contrast them, highlighting key differences and similarities. 3) For each comparison, ask the model to provide confidence estimates for various aspects of its analysis. 4) Create a semantic uncertainty landscape by mapping out these contrastive relationships and associated confidences. 5) Aggregate this information using a graph-based algorithm to produce a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for semantic relationships.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require fine-grained semantic understanding: 1) SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference) for entailment tasks, 2) SWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations) for commonsense reasoning, and 3) SQuAD 2.0 for question answering with unanswerable questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Token-level probability: Use the average token probability of the generated output as an uncertainty measure. 2) Ensemble consistency: Generate multiple outputs and use their consistency as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: CSUM Implementation": "1) Semantic Variant Generation: For each input, use GPT-4 to generate 3-5 semantically similar variants. Prompt: 'Generate 3-5 statements that are semantically similar but subtly different from the following: [INPUT]'. 2) Contrastive Analysis: For each pair of variants, prompt GPT-4 to compare and contrast them. Prompt: 'Compare and contrast the following two statements, highlighting key similarities and differences: [VARIANT1] vs [VARIANT2]'. 3) Confidence Estimation: For each comparison, ask GPT-4 to provide confidence estimates. Prompt: 'On a scale of 0-100, how confident are you in your analysis of the similarities and differences between the statements? Provide separate confidence scores for similarities and differences.' 4) Semantic Uncertainty Landscape: Create a graph where nodes are variants and edges represent comparisons, weighted by confidence scores. 5) Uncertainty Aggregation: Use a graph-based algorithm (e.g., PageRank) to aggregate node uncertainties, producing a final uncertainty score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "1) For SNLI and SWAG, use AUC-ROC for uncertainty-based error detection. 2) For SQuAD 2.0, use AUC-PR for detecting unanswerable questions. 3) Implement a new metric, Semantic Uncertainty Coherence (SUC), which measures the consistency of uncertainty estimates across semantically similar inputs. SUC = 1 - avg(abs(uncertainty(x) - uncertainty(y)) for all semantically similar pairs x, y).",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "1) Vary the number of semantic variants generated. 2) Compare different graph-based aggregation algorithms. 3) Analyze the impact of using different LLMs for different steps (e.g., GPT-3.5 for variant generation, GPT-4 for analysis).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Qualitatively analyze cases where CSUM significantly outperforms baselines. 2) Visualize the semantic uncertainty landscapes for interesting examples. 3) Investigate the relationship between model performance and uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Token Probability)": "Premise: A man in a blue shirt is sitting on a bench. Hypothesis: A person is outside.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Token Probability)": "Entailment (Confidence: 0.92)",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Ensemble Consistency)": "Premise: A man in a blue shirt is sitting on a bench. Hypothesis: A person is outside.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Ensemble Consistency)": "Entailment (Confidence: 0.85)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSUM; Step 1: Variant Generation)": "Generate 3-5 statements that are semantically similar but subtly different from the following: Premise: A man in a blue shirt is sitting on a bench. Hypothesis: A person is outside.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSUM; Step 1: Variant Generation)": "1. Premise: A woman in a red dress is standing near a fountain. Hypothesis: An individual is in an outdoor setting.\n2. Premise: A child wearing a green sweater is playing on a swing. Hypothesis: A young person is in an open area.\n3. Premise: An elderly person with a cane is walking along a path. Hypothesis: A human is in an exterior environment.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSUM; Step 2: Contrastive Analysis)": "Compare and contrast the following two statements, highlighting key similarities and differences: 1) Premise: A man in a blue shirt is sitting on a bench. Hypothesis: A person is outside. 2) Premise: A woman in a red dress is standing near a fountain. Hypothesis: An individual is in an outdoor setting.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSUM; Step 2: Contrastive Analysis)": "Similarities:\n1. Both statements describe a person in an outdoor setting.\n2. Both involve a single individual as the subject.\n3. Both mention specific clothing items.\n\nDifferences:\n1. Gender: The first statement mentions a man, while the second mentions a woman.\n2. Clothing: The first statement describes a blue shirt, while the second mentions a red dress.\n3. Action: In the first statement, the person is sitting, while in the second, they are standing.\n4. Specific location: The first mentions a bench, while the second mentions a fountain.\n5. Wording of the hypothesis: The first uses 'person' and 'outside', while the second uses 'individual' and 'outdoor setting'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSUM; Step 3: Confidence Estimation)": "On a scale of 0-100, how confident are you in your analysis of the similarities and differences between the statements? Provide separate confidence scores for similarities and differences.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSUM; Step 3: Confidence Estimation)": "Confidence in similarities analysis: 95\nConfidence in differences analysis: 98",
            "explanation": "The CSUM method provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by considering semantic relationships and contrasts. While the baselines give a single confidence score, CSUM generates a semantic uncertainty landscape that captures subtle differences in meaning and the model's confidence in distinguishing these differences. This allows for a more robust uncertainty quantification, especially in cases where semantic nuances are crucial."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSUM method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated semantic variants and contrastive analyses to understand where the method falls short. This could lead to insights about the model's semantic understanding capabilities. 2) Explore different ways of aggregating the uncertainty information from the semantic landscape, such as using clustering algorithms to identify semantic 'regions' of high uncertainty. 3) Investigate whether the method performs better on certain types of tasks or linguistic phenomena, which could lead to a more targeted application of the technique. 4) Combine CSUM with other uncertainty estimation methods (e.g., dropout-based methods) to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple techniques. 5) Use the semantic variants and contrastive analyses as additional training data for fine-tuning the model, potentially improving its overall performance and uncertainty estimation capabilities."
