        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple perspectives or competing hypotheses need to be considered.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like ensemble methods or calibrated few-shot prompting don't fully leverage the model's capacity for meta-cognition and multi-perspective reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of internal debate and metacognitive monitoring in human cognition, we propose a method that simulates an internal debate within the LLM to better quantify uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Cognitive Debate Simulation (MCDS), a prompting technique that guides the LLM to engage in a structured internal debate to assess its own uncertainty. For a given query, MCDS first prompts the LLM to generate multiple distinct perspectives or hypotheses. It then initiates a multi-round debate process where each 'debater' (a different prompt-induced perspective of the LLM) argues for its position, critiques others, and updates its stance based on counter-arguments. The LLM is prompted to act as its own moderator, summarizing key points of disagreement and areas of consensus after each round. Crucially, MCDS includes meta-cognitive prompts that ask the LLM to reflect on the debate process itself, identifying sources of uncertainty, evaluating the strength of different arguments, and reasoning about what additional information would be needed to resolve uncertainties. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from analyzing the debate's resolution (or lack thereof), the perceived strength of competing arguments, and the model's meta-cognitive reflections on the process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MCDS on a range of complex reasoning tasks, including ethical dilemmas, scientific hypothesis evaluation, and open-ended prediction tasks. Baselines will include standard uncertainty estimation techniques and simpler debate-style methods. We'll measure not only the calibration of uncertainty estimates but also their informativeness, ability to identify key sources of uncertainty, and potential to guide further inquiry or data collection."

        "Title": "Meta-Cognitive Debate Simulation: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple perspectives or competing hypotheses need to be considered. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions and unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like ensemble methods or calibrated few-shot prompting don't fully leverage the model's capacity for meta-cognition and multi-perspective reasoning. Inspired by the concept of internal debate and metacognitive monitoring in human cognition, we propose a method that simulates an internal debate within the LLM to better quantify uncertainty. This approach aims to leverage the LLM's ability to generate and evaluate multiple perspectives, critically analyze arguments, and reflect on its own reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Cognitive Debate Simulation (MCDS), a prompting technique that guides the LLM to engage in a structured internal debate to assess its own uncertainty. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Perspective Generation: The LLM generates multiple distinct perspectives or hypotheses for a given query. 2) Debate Simulation: The LLM engages in a multi-round debate where each 'debater' (a different prompt-induced perspective) argues for its position, critiques others, and updates its stance based on counter-arguments. 3) Moderation: The LLM acts as its own moderator, summarizing key points of disagreement and areas of consensus after each round. 4) Meta-Cognitive Reflection: The LLM reflects on the debate process, identifying sources of uncertainty, evaluating argument strength, and reasoning about what additional information would be needed to resolve uncertainties. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from analyzing the debate's resolution (or lack thereof), the perceived strength of competing arguments, and the model's meta-cognitive reflections.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate MCDS: 1) Ethical dilemmas from the Moral Uncertainty dataset, 2) Scientific hypothesis evaluation tasks from the ScienceQA dataset, and 3) Open-ended prediction tasks from the Forecasting dataset. For each dataset, we'll select a subset of 100 questions that involve complex reasoning and potential for multiple valid perspectives.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard uncertainty estimation: Use the softmax probabilities of the LLM's output as uncertainty estimates. 2) Ensemble method: Generate multiple outputs with different temperature settings and use the variance as an uncertainty measure. 3) Calibrated few-shot prompting: Use a few-shot prompt with calibrated uncertainty labels.",
            "Step 3: MCDS Implementation": "Implement the MCDS method with the following sub-steps: a) Perspective Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 3-5 distinct perspectives on the given question. b) Debate Simulation: Create a prompt template for a 3-round debate, where each perspective presents arguments, critiques others, and updates its stance. c) Moderation: After each round, prompt the LLM to summarize key disagreements and consensuses. d) Meta-Cognitive Reflection: Prompt the LLM to reflect on the debate process, sources of uncertainty, and potential information gaps.",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Quantification": "Develop a scoring system to quantify uncertainty based on: 1) The level of disagreement between perspectives, 2) The strength and consistency of arguments, 3) The identified sources of uncertainty from meta-cognitive reflection, and 4) The LLM's final assessment of its confidence.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments. Additionally, we'll test GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-2 to assess the generalizability of MCDS across different LLMs.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of MCDS against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration: Compare predicted uncertainty with actual error rates. 2) Sharpness: Measure the concentration of uncertainty estimates. 3) Proper scoring rules: Use Brier score for binary outcomes and Continuous Ranked Probability Score for continuous outcomes. 4) Qualitative analysis: Manually review a subset of debates to assess the quality of reasoning and meta-cognitive insights.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct an in-depth analysis of the results, focusing on: 1) Comparison of MCDS performance against baselines across different task types. 2) The impact of the number of perspectives and debate rounds on uncertainty estimation. 3) The correlation between meta-cognitive insights and actual uncertainty. 4) Common patterns in sources of uncertainty identified by the LLM."

            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What will be the global average temperature increase by 2050 compared to pre-industrial levels? Provide your best estimate and explain your reasoning.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on current climate models and projections, I estimate that the global average temperature increase by 2050 compared to pre-industrial levels will be approximately 2.0\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F). Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Current warming: As of 2021, global temperatures have already increased by about 1.1-1.2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n2. Emission scenarios: Assuming we follow a moderate emission scenario (like SSP2-4.5), which assumes some climate action but not drastic changes.\n\n3. Climate sensitivity: The Earth's climate sensitivity to doubled CO2 is likely between 2.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C.\n\n4. Inertia in the climate system: There's a lag between emissions and temperature response, meaning some warming is already 'locked in.'\n\n5. Potential feedback loops: Some positive feedback loops (like methane release from permafrost) could accelerate warming.\n\n6. International agreements: The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably 1.5\u00b0C, but current policies are insufficient to meet these goals.\n\nGiven these factors, a 2\u00b0C increase by 2050 seems like a reasonable central estimate. However, there's significant uncertainty, and the actual increase could range from about 1.5\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C depending on emissions pathways and climate system responses.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What will be the global average temperature increase by 2050 compared to pre-industrial levels? Use Meta-Cognitive Debate Simulation to analyze this question and quantify your uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Meta-Cognitive Debate Simulation:\n\nPerspective Generation:\n1. Conservative Estimate: 1.5\u00b0C increase\n2. Moderate Estimate: 2.0\u00b0C increase\n3. Pessimistic Estimate: 2.5\u00b0C increase\n\nDebate Simulation (summarized):\nRound 1:\n- Conservative: Argues for increased efficiency and renewable adoption.\n- Moderate: Points to current trends and policy commitments.\n- Pessimistic: Emphasizes feedback loops and policy failures.\n\nRound 2:\n- Conservative: Challenges pessimistic view on feedback loops.\n- Moderate: Acknowledges uncertainties in climate sensitivity.\n- Pessimistic: Questions effectiveness of current policies.\n\nRound 3:\n- All perspectives agree on significant uncertainty but disagree on likelihood of extreme scenarios.\n\nMeta-Cognitive Reflection:\n1. Key uncertainties identified:\n   - Exact climate sensitivity to CO2\n   - Future emission pathways\n   - Tipping points and feedback loops\n   - Effectiveness of climate policies\n2. Strength of arguments:\n   - Moderate view has strongest overall support\n   - Pessimistic view raises important concerns about worst-case scenarios\n   - Conservative view may underestimate inertia in the climate system\n3. Information gaps:\n   - More precise data on current emission trends\n   - Better models of feedback mechanisms\n   - Clearer assessment of policy implementation globally\n\nUncertainty Quantification:\nBased on the debate and reflection, I estimate a 60% probability that the temperature increase will be between 1.8\u00b0C and 2.2\u00b0C, with a 20% chance it could be lower and a 20% chance it could be higher. The uncertainty range spans from about 1.5\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C, with decreasing probability towards the extremes.\n\nConfidence: Moderate (65/100)\nReasoning: While there's a consensus on the general trend of warming, significant uncertainties remain in climate sensitivity, emission pathways, and potential tipping points. The debate highlighted the complexity of the climate system and the limitations in our current predictive capabilities.",
            "explanation": "The MCDS approach provides a more nuanced and self-reflective analysis compared to the baseline. It explicitly considers multiple perspectives, engages in critical evaluation of arguments, and reflects on sources of uncertainty. This results in a more calibrated uncertainty estimate that acknowledges the complexity of the problem and the limitations of our current knowledge."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the MCDS method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated debates to understand why they didn't lead to better uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing types of arguments, identifying patterns in meta-cognitive reflections, and analyzing how different perspectives influence each other. 2) Explore variations of the MCDS method, such as increasing the number of debate rounds, introducing external 'expert' perspectives, or focusing more on specific aspects of meta-cognition (e.g., explicitly prompting for known unknowns). 3) Investigate how MCDS performs across different types of questions and domains, which could lead to insights about when and why certain uncertainty quantification methods work better. 4) Analyze the relationship between the complexity of the generated debate and the accuracy of uncertainty estimates, which could provide insights into the optimal level of reasoning depth for different types of questions. 5) Explore combining MCDS with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using the debate output to inform ensemble methods or calibration techniques. This hybrid approach could leverage the strengths of multiple methods."
