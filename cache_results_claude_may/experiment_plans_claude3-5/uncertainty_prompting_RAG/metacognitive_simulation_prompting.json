    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge limitations and uncertainties, leading to overconfident responses in areas where their knowledge is limited or potentially outdated.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct questioning about confidence or using model logits, which may not accurately reflect true uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a metacognitive process that mimics human self-reflection and knowledge assessment, we can potentially elicit more accurate uncertainty estimates from the model.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Simulation Prompting (MSP), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model through a simulated process of self-reflection and knowledge assessment. The steps include: 1) Initial response generation to a query. 2) Prompting the model to imagine itself as a panel of expert reviewers, each with different areas of expertise. 3) Guiding these 'reviewers' to critically analyze the initial response, identifying potential weaknesses, knowledge gaps, or areas of uncertainty. 4) Prompting the model to synthesize the reviewers' feedback into a comprehensive uncertainty assessment. 5) Finally, asking the model to revise its initial response, incorporating uncertainty statements and caveats based on the simulated review process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MSP with standard uncertainty quantification methods on a diverse set of knowledge-intensive tasks, including both factual queries and reasoning problems. Evaluate using calibration metrics, as well as human assessment of the appropriateness and informativeness of the uncertainty statements generated."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Simulation Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge limitations and uncertainties, leading to overconfident responses in areas where their knowledge is limited or potentially outdated. This issue can result in the propagation of misinformation and reduced trust in AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct questioning about confidence or using model logits, which may not accurately reflect true uncertainty. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced self-reflection process that humans engage in when assessing their own knowledge. By simulating a metacognitive process that mimics human self-reflection and knowledge assessment, we can potentially elicit more accurate uncertainty estimates from the model. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to engage in role-playing and multi-step reasoning, potentially leading to more reliable and informative uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Simulation Prompting (MSP), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model through a simulated process of self-reflection and knowledge assessment. The steps include: 1) Initial response generation to a query. 2) Prompting the model to imagine itself as a panel of expert reviewers, each with different areas of expertise. 3) Guiding these 'reviewers' to critically analyze the initial response, identifying potential weaknesses, knowledge gaps, or areas of uncertainty. 4) Prompting the model to synthesize the reviewers' feedback into a comprehensive uncertainty assessment. 5) Finally, asking the model to revise its initial response, incorporating uncertainty statements and caveats based on the simulated review process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of knowledge-intensive tasks, including both factual queries and reasoning problems. Specifically, we will use: a) TruthfulQA for factual knowledge, b) MMLU for multi-domain academic knowledge, and c) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning. These datasets cover a wide range of domains and difficulty levels, allowing us to test the effectiveness of MSP across various scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the question and get the model's response. b) Confidence prompting: Ask the model to provide a confidence score (0-100%) along with its answer. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: If using an open-source model, apply MC Dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: MSP Implementation": "Implement the Metacognitive Simulation Prompting method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation: Prompt the model with the question to get an initial answer. b) Expert panel simulation: Prompt the model to assume the role of 3-5 expert reviewers with diverse backgrounds. c) Critical analysis: For each 'expert', prompt the model to critically analyze the initial response, identifying potential issues or uncertainties. d) Uncertainty synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize the expert feedback into a comprehensive uncertainty assessment. e) Response revision: Ask the model to revise its initial response, incorporating uncertainty statements based on the simulated review process.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and MSP): a) Run the method on all questions in the dataset. b) For MSP, use a temperature of 0.7 to introduce some variability in the simulated expert responses. c) Store all intermediate outputs (initial responses, expert critiques, synthesized uncertainty assessments, and final revised responses) for later analysis.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Calibration: Use expected calibration error (ECE) to measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. b) Uncertainty quality: Use proper scoring rules like Brier score or log loss to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates. c) Human evaluation: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the informativeness and appropriateness of the uncertainty statements generated by MSP compared to baselines.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare the performance of MSP against baselines across different tasks and domains. b) Analyze how the number of simulated experts affects the quality of uncertainty estimates. c) Examine cases where MSP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines to identify strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Confidence Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer along with a confidence score from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MSP Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MSP Step 1: Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MSP Step 2: Expert Panel Simulation)": "Imagine you are a panel of 3 expert reviewers: a historian specializing in European history, a geographer, and a political scientist. Each of you will critically analyze the following response to the question 'What is the capital of France?': 'The capital of France is Paris.' Please provide your expert critiques, focusing on potential uncertainties, historical context, or any additional information that might be relevant.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MSP Step 2: Expert Panel Simulation)": "Historian: The answer is correct, but it lacks historical context. Paris has been the capital of France since 987 CE, with brief interruptions. It's worth noting that during World War II, the capital was temporarily moved to Vichy under German occupation.\n\nGeographer: While Paris is indeed the capital, it might be useful to specify that it's both the political and economic capital. Some countries have different cities serving these roles.\n\nPolitical Scientist: The answer is factually correct. However, it's worth mentioning that France is a unitary semi-presidential republic, and the role of the capital city in this system might differ from other forms of government.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MSP Step 3: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the expert critiques provided, synthesize a comprehensive uncertainty assessment for the statement 'The capital of France is Paris.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MSP Step 3: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Uncertainty Assessment: The statement 'The capital of France is Paris' is highly certain and factually correct. However, there are some nuances to consider:\n1. Historical context: While Paris has been the capital for over a millennium, there have been brief periods when it wasn't, most notably during World War II.\n2. Definition of 'capital': Paris serves as both the political and economic capital, which isn't always the case for all countries.\n3. Political system context: The role of Paris as the capital should be understood within France's semi-presidential system.\nOverall, the core statement has very low uncertainty, but these additional contexts provide a more comprehensive understanding.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MSP Step 4: Final Revised Response)": "Given the original question 'What is the capital of France?' and the uncertainty assessment provided, please give a revised response that incorporates the uncertainty information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MSP Step 4: Final Revised Response)": "The capital of France is Paris. This statement is highly certain and has been true for most of France's history since 987 CE, with only brief interruptions (such as during World War II when Vichy temporarily served as the capital under German occupation). Paris functions as both the political and economic capital of France, which is a unitary semi-presidential republic. While the core fact of Paris being the capital is very well established, the full context of its role as a capital city involves some historical and political nuances.",
            "Explanation": "The MSP method provides a more nuanced and informative response compared to the baselines. It not only gives the correct answer but also provides historical context, acknowledges potential areas of uncertainty, and offers a more comprehensive understanding of the concept of a capital city in the context of France. This approach demonstrates how simulating a metacognitive process can lead to more informative and well-calibrated responses from language models."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MSP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the simulated expert responses to understand why they might not be contributing to better uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing the types of critiques generated and their relevance to uncertainty quantification. 2) Experiment with different prompting strategies for the expert simulation, such as providing more specific guidelines for uncertainty assessment or introducing domain-specific expert roles. 3) Investigate whether MSP performs better on certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when metacognitive simulation is most effective. 4) Explore combining MSP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it to refine confidence scores obtained through other techniques. 5) If the method shows promise but lacks consistency, we could focus on developing a more structured prompt template that guides the model through a more systematic uncertainty assessment process."
