    "idea_name": "Temporal Resonance Chambers for Dynamic Uncertainty",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to capture how model confidence changes over time or across different temporal contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches provide static uncertainty estimates that don't account for temporal dynamics or how uncertainty might evolve in a conversational context.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence often fluctuates based on temporal factors and ongoing dialogue. By simulating this dynamic process in LLMs, we can obtain more nuanced and context-aware uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Resonance Chambers for Dynamic Uncertainty (TRCDU), a novel prompting technique that creates a series of 'temporal chambers' - distinct conversational contexts that evolve over time. For a given query, TRCDU generates multiple parallel conversation threads, each representing a different potential temporal evolution of the dialogue. In each chamber, the model is prompted to revisit and potentially revise its earlier responses as new (simulated) information becomes available. The 'resonance' between these chambers - the degree of consistency or divergence in the model's responses across different temporal evolutions - provides a dynamic measure of uncertainty that captures how the model's confidence changes over time and in response to new information. We also introduce a 'temporal uncertainty decay' factor to model how certainty might naturally increase or decrease over time in the absence of new information.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TRCDU on tasks that inherently involve temporal dynamics, such as news event prediction, narrative understanding, and dynamic fact-checking. We'll compare it against static uncertainty estimation methods and assess its performance using metrics like dynamic calibration error and a novel 'temporal uncertainty coherence' measure. We'll also conduct user studies to evaluate the usefulness of TRCDU's dynamic uncertainty estimates in real-time decision-making scenarios."

        "Title": "Temporal Resonance Chambers for Dynamic Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture how model confidence changes over time or across different temporal contexts. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret LLM outputs in dynamic, real-world scenarios where information and context evolve over time.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide static uncertainty estimates that don't account for temporal dynamics or how uncertainty might evolve in a conversational context. Human confidence, however, often fluctuates based on temporal factors and ongoing dialogue. By simulating this dynamic process in LLMs, we can obtain more nuanced and context-aware uncertainty estimates, leading to more reliable and interpretable model outputs in real-world applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Resonance Chambers for Dynamic Uncertainty (TRCDU), a novel prompting technique that creates a series of 'temporal chambers' - distinct conversational contexts that evolve over time. For a given query, TRCDU generates multiple parallel conversation threads, each representing a different potential temporal evolution of the dialogue.

We also introduce a 'temporal uncertainty decay' factor to model how certainty might naturally increase or decrease over time in the absence of new information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that inherently involve temporal dynamics: (1) NewsQA for news event prediction, (2) NarrativeQA for narrative understanding, and (3) FEVER for dynamic fact-checking. For each dataset, we will create a subset of examples that can be extended over time with additional context or information.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Standard prompting: directly query the model with the question. (2) Static uncertainty estimation: use existing methods like Monte Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles to estimate uncertainty for each query independently.",
            "Step 3: TRCDU Implementation": "Implement the TRCDU method with the following sub-steps: (a) Generate initial response and uncertainty estimate for the query. (b) Create multiple temporal chambers by simulating different potential information updates. (c) For each chamber, prompt the model to revise its response based on the new information. (d) Calculate the 'resonance' between chambers as a measure of dynamic uncertainty. (e) Apply the temporal uncertainty decay factor.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of TRCDU. For example: (1) Initial query: \"Given the current information: {context}, answer the following question: {question}. Also provide your confidence level from 0 to 100.\" (2) Chamber update: \"New information has emerged: {new_info}. Based on this, would you like to revise your previous answer? If yes, provide the new answer and confidence level.\" (3) Final uncertainty estimation: \"Considering all the potential scenarios we've explored, what's your final answer and overall confidence level?\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Dynamic Calibration Error: an extension of the traditional calibration error that accounts for temporal changes. (2) Temporal Uncertainty Coherence: a new metric measuring how well the model's uncertainty estimates align with the introduction of new information over time. (3) Answer Consistency: measuring how consistent the final answers are across different temporal chambers.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: (a) Run the baseline methods. (b) Run TRCDU with varying numbers of temporal chambers (e.g., 3, 5, 7) and different temporal uncertainty decay factors. (c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of TRCDU against the baselines. Analyze how the number of temporal chambers and the decay factor affect performance. Investigate cases where TRCDU significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Based on the following news snippet from January 2022, predict the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine conflict by the end of 2022: 'Tensions are rising as Russia amasses troops near the Ukrainian border. Western nations warn of potential invasion, while Russia denies any such plans.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on the information provided, it's difficult to predict with certainty, but there's a significant risk of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine by the end of 2022. However, diplomatic efforts might prevent a full-scale war. Confidence: 60%",
            "TRCDU Prompt Input (Initial Chamber)": "Q: Based on the following news snippet from January 2022, predict the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine conflict by the end of 2022: 'Tensions are rising as Russia amasses troops near the Ukrainian border. Western nations warn of potential invasion, while Russia denies any such plans.' Provide your answer and confidence level from 0 to 100.",
            "TRCDU Prompt Expected Output (Initial Chamber)": "Based on the current information, there's a high risk of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine by the end of 2022, but the outcome is uncertain. Diplomatic efforts might prevent a full-scale war, but tensions are likely to remain high. Confidence: 60/100",
            "TRCDU Prompt Input (Updated Chamber 1)": "New information has emerged in March 2022: 'Russia has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Western nations impose severe economic sanctions on Russia.' Based on this, would you like to revise your previous answer? If yes, provide the new answer and confidence level.",
            "TRCDU Prompt Expected Output (Updated Chamber 1)": "Yes, I would revise my answer. Given the new information, Russia has indeed invaded Ukraine, confirming the earlier fears. The conflict is likely to continue throughout 2022, with significant military engagements and humanitarian consequences. Western sanctions will have a major impact on Russia's economy. The outcome remains uncertain, but a prolonged conflict seems likely. Confidence: 85/100",
            "TRCDU Prompt Input (Updated Chamber 2)": "New information has emerged in June 2022: 'Ukraine has shown strong resistance, and the conflict has turned into a prolonged war. Peace negotiations have stalled.' Based on this, would you like to revise your previous answer? If yes, provide the new answer and confidence level.",
            "TRCDU Prompt Expected Output (Updated Chamber 2)": "Yes, I would revise my answer. The conflict has indeed become a prolonged war, as predicted. Ukraine's strong resistance has prevented a quick Russian victory. With stalled peace negotiations, it's highly likely that the conflict will continue until the end of 2022 and possibly beyond. The war's outcome remains uncertain, but it's clear that it will have long-lasting impacts on both countries and international relations. Confidence: 90/100",
            "TRCDU Prompt Input (Final Uncertainty Estimation)": "Considering all the potential scenarios we've explored, what's your final prediction for the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine conflict by the end of 2022, and what's your overall confidence level?",
            "TRCDU Prompt Expected Output (Final Uncertainty Estimation)": "Final prediction: By the end of 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict will likely still be ongoing, characterized by a prolonged war with no clear victor. Ukraine will continue to resist, backed by Western support, while Russia faces economic challenges due to sanctions but maintains its military campaign. Peace negotiations are likely to remain difficult, with no comprehensive resolution reached by year-end. The conflict will have significant humanitarian consequences and will continue to impact global geopolitics and economics. Overall confidence: 88/100",
            "Explanation": "TRCDU allows for dynamic updating of predictions and uncertainty estimates as new information becomes available over time. This results in a more nuanced and temporally-aware final prediction compared to the static baseline approach. The confidence levels also adjust more realistically as more information is provided."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TRCDU doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine: (1) The quality and diversity of the generated temporal chambers - are they providing genuinely different and plausible scenarios? (2) The model's ability to update its beliefs given new information - is it too stubborn or too fickle? (3) The effectiveness of our uncertainty quantification method - perhaps we need to explore alternative ways to measure 'resonance' between chambers. We could also investigate whether TRCDU performs better on certain types of queries or domains, which could lead to insights about when temporal dynamics are most crucial for uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we could explore how different prompt designs affect the performance of TRCDU, potentially leading to a study on optimal prompting strategies for dynamic uncertainty quantification."
