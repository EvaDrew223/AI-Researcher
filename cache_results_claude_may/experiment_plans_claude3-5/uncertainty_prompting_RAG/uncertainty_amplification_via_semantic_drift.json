        "Problem": "Current LLMs often fail to recognize when their reasoning drifts away from the core topic, leading to overconfident but irrelevant or incorrect responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly focus on direct confidence estimation or consistency across multiple samples, but don't explicitly address semantic drift in the reasoning process.",
        "Motivation": "By actively encouraging the model to explore potential semantic drifts and assess their impact on answer confidence, we can better capture epistemic uncertainty and improve calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Amplification via Semantic Drift (UASD), a novel prompting technique. UASD first generates a chain-of-thought reasoning path. It then prompts the model to intentionally introduce semantic drifts at various points in the reasoning chain, creating multiple 'drift scenarios'. For each scenario, the model is asked to assess how the drift affects the final answer and confidence. Finally, UASD aggregates these assessments to produce a drift-aware confidence score and explanation. This method helps the model recognize when it's veering off-topic and adjust its confidence accordingly.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UASD against standard chain-of-thought and direct confidence elicitation methods on complex reasoning tasks such as multi-hop QA and logical reasoning benchmarks. We'll measure improvements in calibration using metrics like Brier score and ECE, and assess the quality of drift detection through expert evaluation."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Amplification via Semantic Drift: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize when their reasoning drifts away from the core topic, leading to overconfident but irrelevant or incorrect responses. This issue undermines the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs mainly focus on direct confidence estimation or consistency across multiple samples, but don't explicitly address semantic drift in the reasoning process. By actively encouraging the model to explore potential semantic drifts and assess their impact on answer confidence, we can better capture epistemic uncertainty and improve calibration. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often consider alternative interpretations or tangential thoughts to gauge our confidence in a conclusion.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Amplification via Semantic Drift (UASD), a novel prompting technique. UASD operates in four main steps: 1) Generate an initial chain-of-thought reasoning path for the given question. 2) Prompt the model to intentionally introduce semantic drifts at various points in the reasoning chain, creating multiple 'drift scenarios'. 3) For each drift scenario, ask the model to assess how the drift affects the final answer and confidence. 4) Aggregate these assessments to produce a drift-aware confidence score and explanation. This method helps the model recognize when it's veering off-topic and adjust its confidence accordingly.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks such as multi-hop QA (e.g., HotpotQA) and logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., LogiQA). These datasets should be preprocessed to ensure they have well-defined ground truth answers and are suitable for chain-of-thought reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and direct confidence elicitation methods. For CoT, use prompts like 'Let's approach this step-by-step:'. For direct confidence elicitation, append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to the question.",
            "Step 3: UASD Implementation": "Implement the UASD method with the following sub-steps: a) Generate initial CoT: Use the same prompt as the CoT baseline. b) Generate drift scenarios: Prompt with 'Now, let's consider potential semantic drifts in our reasoning. Provide 3 alternative paths where the reasoning might veer off-topic:'. c) Assess drift impact: For each drift scenario, prompt with 'How does this semantic drift affect the final answer and your confidence in it?'. d) Aggregate assessments: Implement a simple averaging method to combine the confidence scores from all drift scenarios.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model, accessed through the OpenAI API. We'll also test on GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Run both baseline methods and UASD on the prepared datasets. Measure performance using: a) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. b) Calibration metrics: Brier score and Expected Calibration Error (ECE). c) Qualitative analysis: Manual review of a subset of examples to assess the quality of drift detection and explanation.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: a) Vary the number of drift scenarios generated. b) Test different aggregation methods for the final confidence score. c) Compare performance with and without the explanation generation step.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze the results, focusing on: a) Comparison of UASD performance against baselines. b) Correlation between semantic drift magnitude and confidence adjustment. c) Qualitative assessment of the generated explanations. d) Analysis of cases where UASD significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought)": "Q: If Alice is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Charlie, who is the shortest among them? Let's approach this step-by-step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought)": "1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   - Alice is taller than Bob\n   - Bob is taller than Charlie\n2. Let's order them from tallest to shortest:\n   - Alice is the tallest because she's taller than Bob\n   - Bob is in the middle because he's shorter than Alice but taller than Charlie\n   - Charlie must be the shortest because Bob is taller than him, and Alice is taller than Bob\n3. Therefore, the shortest among them is Charlie.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: If Alice is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Charlie, who is the shortest among them? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "The shortest among them is Charlie. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UASD; Step 1: Initial CoT)": "Q: If Alice is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Charlie, who is the shortest among them? Let's approach this step-by-step:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UASD; Step 1: Initial CoT)": "[Same as the Baseline CoT output]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UASD; Step 2: Generate Drift Scenarios)": "Now, let's consider potential semantic drifts in our reasoning. Provide 3 alternative paths where the reasoning might veer off-topic:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UASD; Step 2: Generate Drift Scenarios)": "1. Height vs. Age Drift: What if we start considering their ages instead of heights? Alice might be the oldest, but that doesn't necessarily correlate with height.\n2. Name Alphabetical Order Drift: If we arrange Alice, Bob, and Charlie alphabetically by name, we get a different order that's unrelated to their heights.\n3. Social Status Drift: What if 'taller' is a metaphor for social status or influence, rather than physical height?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UASD; Step 3: Assess Drift Impact)": "How does each semantic drift affect the final answer and your confidence in it?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UASD; Step 3: Assess Drift Impact)": "1. Height vs. Age Drift: This drift doesn't affect the answer, as age is irrelevant to the height comparison. Confidence remains high at 95%.\n2. Name Alphabetical Order Drift: This completely derails the reasoning. If we followed this, we'd incorrectly conclude Alice is 'shortest'. Confidence in the original answer drops to 60%.\n3. Social Status Drift: This interpretation changes the meaning of the question entirely. If 'taller' means higher status, we can't determine who is 'shortest'. Confidence in the original answer drops to 30%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UASD; Step 4: Final Response)": "Based on the original reasoning and the drift scenarios, what is your final answer and confidence?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UASD; Step 4: Final Response)": "Final Answer: Charlie is the shortest among them.\nConfidence: 78%\nExplanation: While the initial logical reasoning strongly supports this conclusion, considering potential semantic drifts reveals some uncertainties. The possibility of misinterpreting 'taller' as a metaphor for something other than physical height, or getting distracted by irrelevant factors like alphabetical order, slightly reduces our overall confidence. However, the core logical relationship described in the question still strongly points to Charlie being the shortest.",
            "Explanation": "UASD prompting allows the model to explore potential misinterpretations and irrelevant tangents, leading to a more nuanced and cautious final confidence estimate compared to the overconfident baseline methods. This approach better reflects the true uncertainty inherent in language interpretation and reasoning."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UASD doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why LLMs struggle with semantic drift awareness. We could investigate patterns in the generated drift scenarios, analyzing which types of drifts the model considers plausible and how this relates to its training data or architecture. We might also explore whether certain question types or domains are more prone to semantic drift, potentially uncovering insights about LLM reasoning processes. Additionally, we could compare UASD results across different model sizes or architectures to see if larger or differently structured models are more or less susceptible to semantic drift. This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and inform future approaches to improving their reasoning capabilities and uncertainty estimation."
