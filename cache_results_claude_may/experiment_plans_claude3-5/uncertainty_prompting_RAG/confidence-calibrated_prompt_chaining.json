    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately express uncertainty across different tasks and domains, often providing overconfident responses for incorrect or ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like verbalized confidence and token probability analysis have shown limited success in calibrating LLM confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down complex queries into subtasks and calibrating confidence at each step, we can potentially achieve more accurate overall uncertainty estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence-Calibrated Prompt Chaining (CCPC), which decomposes queries into a series of interdependent subtasks. For each subtask, we prompt the LLM to provide both an answer and a confidence score. We then use a novel aggregation function that combines these intermediate confidences, weighing them based on their importance to the final answer. The prompts are carefully designed to encourage the model to consider different aspects of uncertainty, such as factual knowledge, reasoning ability, and task complexity. Additionally, we incorporate a 'confidence budget' mechanism, where the model is instructed to distribute a fixed amount of confidence across all subtasks, forcing it to prioritize certainty in critical steps.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CCPC against standard prompting and existing confidence estimation methods on diverse tasks including multi-hop reasoning, open-ended generation, and factual QA. We'll use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error, Brier Score, and task-specific performance measures."

        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Prompt Chaining: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately express uncertainty across different tasks and domains, frequently providing overconfident responses for incorrect or ambiguous queries. This lack of calibration can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like verbalized confidence and token probability analysis have shown limited success in calibrating LLM confidence. By breaking down complex queries into subtasks and calibrating confidence at each step, we can potentially achieve more accurate overall uncertainty estimation. This approach is inspired by human problem-solving strategies, where we often tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts and assessing our confidence at each stage.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence-Calibrated Prompt Chaining (CCPC), which decomposes queries into a series of interdependent subtasks. For each subtask, we prompt the LLM to provide both an answer and a confidence score. We then use a novel aggregation function that combines these intermediate confidences, weighing them based on their importance to the final answer. The prompts are carefully designed to encourage the model to consider different aspects of uncertainty, such as factual knowledge, reasoning ability, and task complexity. Additionally, we incorporate a 'confidence budget' mechanism, where the model is instructed to distribute a fixed amount of confidence across all subtasks, forcing it to prioritize certainty in critical steps.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate CCPC: (1) MultiRC for multi-hop reasoning, (2) TruthfulQA for open-ended generation, and (3) Natural Questions for factual QA. These datasets cover a range of task types and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting, (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and (3) Self-consistency sampling. For each method, we'll use the LLM's output probability as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: CCPC Implementation": "Implement the CCPC method as follows: (a) Develop a prompt template for decomposing queries into subtasks. (b) Create a confidence elicitation prompt that asks the model to provide a confidence score (0-100) for each subtask. (c) Implement the confidence budget mechanism by instructing the model to distribute 100 points of confidence across all subtasks. (d) Design an aggregation function that combines subtask confidences based on their dependencies and importance.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Refine the prompts for CCPC through iterative testing. Focus on clarity of instructions, encouraging consideration of different uncertainty factors, and guiding the model to distribute the confidence budget effectively.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CCPC against the baselines using the following metrics: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (2) Brier Score, (3) Task-specific performance measures (e.g., F1 score for QA tasks). Additionally, we'll analyze the correlation between subtask confidences and final answer correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: (a) Comparison of calibration curves for CCPC vs. baselines. (b) Analysis of how confidence scores change across subtasks. (c) Investigation of cases where CCPC significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. (d) Examination of the effectiveness of the confidence budget mechanism."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon, and in which year did this happen?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon in 1969.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon, and in which year did this happen?\n\nLet's break this down into subtasks:\n1. Identify the first person to step on the moon.\n2. Determine the year of the moon landing.\n\nFor each subtask, provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100). Remember, you have a total confidence budget of 100 points to distribute between the two subtasks.\n\nSubtask 1: Identify the first person to step on the moon.\nAnswer:\nConfidence (0-100):\n\nSubtask 2: Determine the year of the moon landing.\nAnswer:\nConfidence (0-100):\n\nNow, provide the final answer combining the results from both subtasks.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Subtask 1: Identify the first person to step on the moon.\nAnswer: Neil Armstrong\nConfidence: 95\n\nSubtask 2: Determine the year of the moon landing.\nAnswer: 1969\nConfidence: 5\n\nFinal Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon in 1969.\n\nOverall Confidence: The overall confidence in this answer is moderate. While I'm very confident about Neil Armstrong being the first person on the moon (95/100), I'm much less certain about the exact year (5/100). The combined confidence suggests that while the core fact is likely correct, the specific year might benefit from verification.",
            "explanation": "The CCPC method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence. It correctly assigns high confidence to the well-known fact about Neil Armstrong, but expresses uncertainty about the exact year. This granular confidence assessment allows for a more accurate overall uncertainty estimation, potentially prompting users to verify the less certain aspects of the answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCPC doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We might investigate whether the subtask decomposition is effective by comparing performance on different types of questions (e.g., single-fact vs. multi-hop reasoning). We could also analyze the relationship between subtask difficulty and confidence scores to see if the model is accurately assessing task complexity. Additionally, we might explore alternative aggregation functions for combining subtask confidences, or experiment with different prompting strategies for eliciting more accurate confidence estimates. If these approaches don't yield improvements, we could shift our focus to analyzing how different types of questions and contexts affect LLM confidence, potentially uncovering insights about the model's internal representations of uncertainty. This could lead to a valuable analysis paper on the challenges of uncertainty quantification in LLMs."
