        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly for complex tasks involving multi-step reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like confidence elicitation and ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in different reasoning steps.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by gradient descent in optimization, we can iteratively refine uncertainty estimates by probing the model's confidence landscape.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Gradient Descent Prompting (UGDP), which iteratively refines uncertainty estimates through targeted probing. The process begins with an initial response and uncertainty estimate. We then generate multiple slight variations of the reasoning steps, prompting the model to compare its confidence in these variations. By analyzing how small changes affect confidence, we construct a local 'gradient' of uncertainty. We use this gradient to guide the next iteration, focusing on areas of high uncertainty slope. This process repeats, allowing us to 'descend' towards more accurate uncertainty quantification. The final output combines the refined reasoning steps with a nuanced, step-specific uncertainty profile.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UGDP against standard confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on multi-step reasoning tasks from domains like mathematical problem-solving and logical deduction. We'll measure calibration, sharpness, and task-specific performance metrics."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Gradient Descent Prompting: Iterative Refinement of Confidence Estimates in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly for complex tasks involving multi-step reasoning. This issue is critical as it can lead to overconfident errors or underutilization of the model's capabilities. Existing methods like confidence elicitation and ensemble approaches often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in different reasoning steps, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs often treat the model as a black box, failing to leverage the model's own reasoning capabilities. Inspired by gradient descent in optimization, we propose to iteratively refine uncertainty estimates by probing the model's confidence landscape. This approach allows us to tap into the model's ability to reason about its own uncertainties, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Gradient Descent Prompting (UGDP), which iteratively refines uncertainty estimates through targeted probing. The process begins with an initial response and uncertainty estimate. We then generate multiple slight variations of the reasoning steps, prompting the model to compare its confidence in these variations. By analyzing how small changes affect confidence, we construct a local 'gradient' of uncertainty. We use this gradient to guide the next iteration, focusing on areas of high uncertainty slope. This process repeats, allowing us to 'descend' towards more accurate uncertainty quantification. The final output combines the refined reasoning steps with a nuanced, step-specific uncertainty profile.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-step reasoning tasks from domains like mathematical problem-solving (GSM8K dataset) and logical deduction (LogiQA dataset). These datasets provide complex problems that require step-by-step reasoning, making them ideal for our uncertainty quantification experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Standard confidence elicitation: Directly ask the model to provide a confidence score for its answer. (2) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses and use their agreement as a proxy for confidence. For each baseline, use the following prompt structure: 'Solve the following problem step by step, and provide a confidence score (0-100) for your final answer: [problem]'",
            "Step 3: UGDP Implementation": "Implement the UGDP method with the following steps: a) Initial response: Use the prompt 'Solve the following problem step by step, providing a confidence score (0-100) for each step: [problem]' b) Generate variations: For each reasoning step, create slight variations (e.g., changing numbers, rephrasing) c) Confidence comparison: Prompt the model to compare confidence between original and variations d) Gradient construction: Analyze how confidence changes with variations to construct a local gradient e) Iteration: Use the gradient to focus on high uncertainty areas and repeat the process f) Final output: Combine refined steps with step-specific confidence scores",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments, as it represents a state-of-the-art LLM with strong reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance: a) Calibration: Measure how well the confidence scores align with actual correctness b) Sharpness: Assess the specificity of the uncertainty estimates c) Task-specific performance: Evaluate the accuracy of the final answers d) Uncertainty resolution: Measure how uncertainty changes over UGDP iterations",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the datasets: a) Apply both baseline methods and record results b) Apply UGDP method for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 5) and record intermediate and final results c) Compare the final uncertainty estimates and answers across all methods",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of calibration and sharpness across methods b) Analysis of how UGDP affects task-specific performance c) Examination of uncertainty resolution over UGDP iterations d) Qualitative analysis of the reasoning steps and how they change during UGDP"

            "UGDP Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Solve the following problem step by step, providing a confidence score (0-100) for each step: If a train travels 120 km in 2 hours, what is its average speed in km/h?",
                    "Output": "Step 1: Identify the given information (Confidence: 100)\n- Distance traveled = 120 km\n- Time taken = 2 hours\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for average speed (Confidence: 95)\nAverage speed = Distance \u00f7 Time\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values and calculate (Confidence: 90)\nAverage speed = 120 km \u00f7 2 hours = 60 km/h\n\nFinal Answer: The average speed of the train is 60 km/h. (Overall Confidence: 95)"
                },
                "Step 2 - Generate Variations": {
                    "Variation 1": "Step 3: Plug in the values and calculate (Confidence: ?)\nAverage speed = 120 km \u00f7 2 hours = 70 km/h",
                    "Variation 2": "Step 2: Recall the formula for average speed (Confidence: ?)\nAverage speed = Time \u00f7 Distance"
                },
                "Step 3 - Confidence Comparison": {
                    "Input": "Compare your confidence in the original steps versus the variations:",
                    "Output": "Variation 1 (70 km/h calculation):\nMy confidence in this variation is much lower (30) compared to the original step (90). The calculation is incorrect, as 120 \u00f7 2 is clearly 60, not 70.\n\nVariation 2 (Reversed formula):\nMy confidence in this variation is very low (10) compared to the original step (95). The formula is incorrect; it should be Distance \u00f7 Time, not Time \u00f7 Distance."
                },
                "Step 4 - Gradient Construction": "The confidence gradient is steepest for Step 2 (formula recall), indicating this is the most critical step for ensuring accuracy.",
                "Step 5 - Iteration": "Focus on reinforcing the correct formula and its application.",
                "Final Output": "Step 1: Identify the given information (Confidence: 100)\n- Distance traveled = 120 km\n- Time taken = 2 hours\n\nStep 2: Apply the correct formula for average speed (Confidence: 100)\nAverage speed = Distance \u00f7 Time\nThis formula is fundamental in physics and is always true for calculating average speed.\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values and calculate (Confidence: 98)\nAverage speed = 120 km \u00f7 2 hours = 60 km/h\nThis calculation is straightforward: 120 divided by 2 equals 60.\n\nFinal Answer: The average speed of the train is 60 km/h. (Overall Confidence: 99)\n\nExplanation: Through the UGDP process, we've reinforced our understanding of the correct formula and its application, leading to a higher overall confidence in our answer."
            },
            "Explanation": "The UGDP method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's confidence in each step of the reasoning process. By generating variations and comparing confidences, we can identify areas of uncertainty and focus on improving them. This leads to a more robust final answer with well-calibrated confidence scores for each step."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UGDP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine the nature of the 'uncertainty gradients' generated by the method, investigating whether they provide meaningful information about the model's reasoning process. This could lead to insights about how LLMs represent and reason about their own uncertainty. Additionally, we could explore how different types of variations in the reasoning steps affect the model's confidence, potentially uncovering patterns in what causes uncertainty in LLM reasoning. This analysis could inform the development of alternative methods for probing and improving LLM uncertainty estimates, or could result in a paper focused on characterizing the landscape of LLM uncertainty in multi-step reasoning tasks."
