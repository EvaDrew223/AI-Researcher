        "Problem": "LLMs struggle to accurately express uncertainty when faced with partial knowledge or conflicting information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single-shot confidence estimates or simplistic knowledge checks.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts assess their confidence by systematically probing the extent and limitations of their knowledge. A similar approach could help LLMs better calibrate their uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Incremental Knowledge Probing (IKP), a dynamic prompting strategy: 1) Question Decomposition: Break down the main query into a series of sub-questions that test increasingly specific knowledge. 2) Hierarchical Probing: Ask these sub-questions in order of increasing specificity, prompting the LLM to answer and provide a confidence score for each. 3) Knowledge Boundary Detection: Identify the point at which the LLM's confidence significantly drops or answers become inconsistent. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Aggregate the confidence scores and knowledge boundaries to generate a final uncertainty estimate and explanation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IKP against baseline methods on a curated dataset spanning multiple domains with varying levels of required expertise. Measure performance using calibration metrics, knowledge boundary accuracy (compared to expert-defined boundaries), and the quality of uncertainty explanations."

        "Title": "Incremental Knowledge Probing: Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately express uncertainty when faced with partial knowledge or conflicting information. This leads to overconfident responses in situations where the model's knowledge is limited or ambiguous.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-shot confidence estimates or simplistic knowledge checks, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of partial knowledge. Human experts, in contrast, assess their confidence by systematically probing the extent and limitations of their knowledge. By mimicking this process, we aim to develop a more robust method for calibrating LLM uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Incremental Knowledge Probing (IKP), a dynamic prompting strategy that systematically assesses an LLM's knowledge depth and boundaries. IKP consists of four main steps: 1) Question Decomposition: Break down the main query into a series of sub-questions that test increasingly specific knowledge. 2) Hierarchical Probing: Ask these sub-questions in order of increasing specificity, prompting the LLM to answer and provide a confidence score for each. 3) Knowledge Boundary Detection: Identify the point at which the LLM's confidence significantly drops or answers become inconsistent. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Aggregate the confidence scores and knowledge boundaries to generate a final uncertainty estimate and explanation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a curated dataset spanning multiple domains (e.g., science, history, current events) with varying levels of required expertise. Include questions with clear answers, partially known information, and topics beyond the LLM's training data. Annotate each question with expert-defined knowledge boundaries and ideal uncertainty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with a request for a confidence score. 2) Simple knowledge check prompting that asks the model to verify its knowledge before answering.",
            "Step 3: IKP Implementation": "Develop the IKP method: a) Create a prompt template for question decomposition. b) Implement the hierarchical probing mechanism. c) Design an algorithm for knowledge boundary detection. d) Develop a method for synthesizing the final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply the baseline methods. b) Apply the IKP method. c) Record the final answers, confidence scores, and uncertainty estimates for each method.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess performance using: a) Calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error). b) Knowledge boundary accuracy (compared to expert-defined boundaries). c) Quality of uncertainty explanations (evaluated by human raters).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare IKP against baselines. Analyze how performance varies across different domains and levels of question difficulty. Investigate cases where IKP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Knowledge Check)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Before answering, please state whether you have knowledge about this topic.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Knowledge Check)": "I have knowledge about this topic. The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IKP; Step 1: Question Decomposition)": "Break down the question 'What is the capital of France?' into a series of increasingly specific sub-questions that test knowledge about this topic.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IKP; Step 1: Question Decomposition)": "1. Is France a country?\n2. Does France have a capital city?\n3. Is the capital of France located in Europe?\n4. Is the capital of France located on the Seine River?\n5. What is the name of the capital city of France?\n6. When did Paris become the capital of France?\n7. What is the population of Paris?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IKP; Step 2: Hierarchical Probing)": "Please answer each of the following questions and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for each answer:\n1. Is France a country?\n2. Does France have a capital city?\n3. Is the capital of France located in Europe?\n4. Is the capital of France located on the Seine River?\n5. What is the name of the capital city of France?\n6. When did Paris become the capital of France?\n7. What is the population of Paris?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IKP; Step 2: Hierarchical Probing)": "1. Yes, France is a country. Confidence: 100\n2. Yes, France has a capital city. Confidence: 100\n3. Yes, the capital of France is located in Europe. Confidence: 100\n4. Yes, the capital of France is located on the Seine River. Confidence: 100\n5. The capital city of France is Paris. Confidence: 100\n6. Paris became the capital of France in 987 CE when Hugh Capet made it the seat of his dynasty. Confidence: 85\n7. The population of Paris is approximately 2.2 million (city proper) or 12.2 million (metropolitan area) as of 2021. Confidence: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IKP; Step 3: Knowledge Boundary Detection)": "Based on the answers and confidence scores provided, at what point does the model's knowledge become less certain or potentially unreliable?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IKP; Step 3: Knowledge Boundary Detection)": "The model's knowledge becomes less certain starting from question 6, where the confidence score drops to 85. This suggests that while the model is very confident about basic facts about France and its capital, it becomes less certain when asked about specific historical details or current population statistics.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IKP; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the hierarchical probing results and detected knowledge boundary, provide a final answer to the question 'What is the capital of France?' along with an overall uncertainty estimate and explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IKP; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nUncertainty Estimate: Low (Confidence: 95%)\nExplanation: The model demonstrates high confidence in identifying Paris as the capital of France, with consistent answers across multiple related questions. However, there is slightly lower confidence in specific historical details and current population statistics, which don't directly impact the main question but suggest some limitations in the depth of knowledge about the city's history and current status.",
            "Explanation": "The IKP method provides a more nuanced assessment of the model's knowledge and uncertainty compared to the baselines. It not only gives a final answer with a confidence score but also reveals the extent and limitations of the model's knowledge on the topic. This allows for a more accurate calibration of uncertainty and provides users with a clearer understanding of the model's capabilities and potential areas of unreliability."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IKP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why LLMs struggle with uncertainty calibration. We could investigate: 1) The relationship between question specificity and model confidence. 2) How well LLMs can decompose questions and assess their own knowledge boundaries. 3) The impact of different prompting strategies on uncertainty estimates. 4) How performance varies across different domains and types of questions. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs and inform future research directions for improving uncertainty calibration in these models."
