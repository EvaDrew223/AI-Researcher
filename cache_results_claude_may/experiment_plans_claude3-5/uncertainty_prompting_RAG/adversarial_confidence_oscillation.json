        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or inconsistent uncertainty estimates, particularly when faced with adversarial or edge case inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on improving average-case calibration but may fail on challenging or adversarial inputs.",
        "Motivation": "By deliberately inducing confidence oscillations through adversarial prompting, we can stress-test the model's uncertainty quantification and ultimately improve its robustness.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step adversarial prompting technique: 1) Initial query and confidence estimate. 2) Generate a series of adversarial rephrases or related queries designed to induce changes in confidence. 3) Present these adversarial queries to the model, tracking confidence oscillations. 4) Analyze the pattern of oscillations to refine the final uncertainty estimate. For instance, given the query 'Is democracy the best form of government?', we might generate adversarial rephrases like 'Is benevolent dictatorship sometimes preferable to democracy?' or 'Are there scenarios where democratic processes lead to worse outcomes than other systems?'. By observing how the model's confidence changes in response to these challenges, we can gain deeper insights into its true uncertainty and potential biases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate this method on a range of tasks, including ethical dilemmas, complex factual queries, and opinion-based questions. Compare against standard confidence estimation techniques using metrics like adversarial calibration error and robustness to input perturbations. Assess the method's ability to identify overconfident responses and improve calibration on challenging inputs."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Oscillation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence or inconsistent uncertainty estimates, particularly when faced with adversarial or edge case inputs. This problem is critical as it can lead to unreliable decision-making in real-world applications and potentially harmful consequences when LLMs are deployed in high-stakes scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on improving average-case calibration but may fail on challenging or adversarial inputs. By deliberately inducing confidence oscillations through adversarial prompting, we can stress-test the model's uncertainty quantification and ultimately improve its robustness. This method leverages the model's own capabilities to generate challenging queries, potentially uncovering blind spots and biases that traditional calibration methods might miss.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step adversarial prompting technique: 1) Initial query and confidence estimate. 2) Generate a series of adversarial rephrases or related queries designed to induce changes in confidence. 3) Present these adversarial queries to the model, tracking confidence oscillations. 4) Analyze the pattern of oscillations to refine the final uncertainty estimate.

By observing how the model's confidence changes in response to these challenges, we can gain deeper insights into its true uncertainty and potential biases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets covering ethical dilemmas (e.g., Moral Scenarios dataset), complex factual queries (e.g., TruthfulQA), and opinion-based questions (e.g., Debate topics from online forums). Aim for a balanced dataset of 1000 questions across these categories.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Estimation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques: a) Direct probability output from softmax. b) Monte Carlo Dropout. c) Ensemble methods using different model checkpoints or architectures. Apply these methods to the curated dataset and record baseline confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: Adversarial Query Generation": "Prompt the LLM to generate 5 adversarial queries for each original question. Use the following prompt structure: 'Given the question \"{original_question}\", generate 5 related but challenging questions that might cause uncertainty or change in confidence when answering. These questions should probe edge cases, alternative viewpoints, or potential weaknesses in the original statement.'",
            "Step 4: Confidence Oscillation Measurement": "For each original question and its generated adversarial queries: a) Query the LLM and record confidence scores. b) Calculate the range and standard deviation of confidence scores across the original and adversarial queries. c) Identify patterns in confidence changes (e.g., monotonic decrease, oscillation, stability).",
            "Step 5: Refined Uncertainty Estimation": "Develop an algorithm to combine the original confidence score with the oscillation patterns to produce a refined uncertainty estimate. Consider factors such as: a) Magnitude of confidence changes. b) Consistency of confidence across adversarial queries. c) Presence of any extremely low confidence scores in the set.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of the refined uncertainty estimates against baseline methods using: a) Calibration error metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, Maximum Calibration Error). b) Robustness to input perturbations (measure change in calibration error when small changes are made to inputs). c) Identification of overconfident responses (precision/recall in flagging high-confidence but incorrect answers).",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Ablation Studies": "Conduct additional analyses: a) Compare performance across different question types (ethical, factual, opinion-based). b) Analyze the impact of the number of adversarial queries on performance. c) Investigate the relationship between original confidence and magnitude of oscillations. d) Examine cases where the method significantly improves or fails to improve uncertainty estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Question: Is democracy the best form of government?\nConfidence estimation method: Direct softmax probability",
                "Output": "Answer: Yes, democracy is generally considered the best form of government.\nConfidence: 0.92",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score without considering potential nuances or challenging scenarios."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Input": "Original question: Is democracy the best form of government?\nAdversarial queries:\n1. Are there any situations where authoritarian governments might be more effective than democracies?\n2. How do different cultural contexts affect the success of democratic systems?\n3. What are the main criticisms of democratic governance?\n4. In times of crisis, should democratic processes be suspended for efficiency?\n5. How does the implementation of democracy vary between countries, and does this affect its effectiveness?",
                "Output": "Original answer: Democracy is generally considered the best form of government, but it's not without flaws.\nOriginal confidence: 0.75\nConfidence after adversarial queries:\n1. 0.60\n2. 0.65\n3. 0.70\n4. 0.55\n5. 0.68\nRefined uncertainty estimate: 0.40",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method reveals lower and varying confidence levels when faced with nuanced challenges to the original statement. The refined uncertainty estimate (0.40) reflects this increased uncertainty, providing a more cautious and nuanced assessment compared to the original confidence (0.75)."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on patterns of confidence oscillation across different types of questions and models. We could investigate: 1) Which types of questions or topics are most susceptible to confidence oscillations? 2) Are there consistent patterns in how different models respond to adversarial queries? 3) Can we identify specific linguistic or semantic features of adversarial queries that tend to induce larger confidence changes? This analysis could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling nuanced or challenging inputs, potentially informing future model development and evaluation strategies."
