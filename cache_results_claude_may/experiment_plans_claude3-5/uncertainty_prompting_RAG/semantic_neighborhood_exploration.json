        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often fail to capture the nuanced relationships between concepts, leading to poor calibration in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on direct prompting or sampling-based methods, which may not fully leverage the model's understanding of semantic relationships.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring the semantic neighborhood of a given query, we can gain insights into the model's uncertainty by observing how its responses change with subtle shifts in meaning or context.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a method that generates a diverse set of semantically related queries to probe the model's uncertainty landscape. Given an initial query, SNE uses the LLM itself to generate variations by applying operations such as generalization, specification, analogy, and contrast. For each generated query, the model provides a response and confidence score. The uncertainty for the original query is then estimated based on the consistency and confidence distribution across the semantic neighborhood. SNE incorporates adaptive sampling to focus on areas of high uncertainty or disagreement within the neighborhood.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SNE on tasks requiring nuanced understanding, such as legal reasoning, scientific hypothesis generation, and complex moral dilemmas. Baselines will include standard uncertainty estimation techniques and recent prompting methods. We will measure performance using calibration plots, expected calibration error, and human expert evaluations of the appropriateness of expressed uncertainty."

        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the nuanced relationships between concepts, leading to poor calibration in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in critical applications requiring accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct prompting or sampling-based methods, which may not fully leverage the model's understanding of semantic relationships. By exploring the semantic neighborhood of a given query, we can gain deeper insights into the model's uncertainty by observing how its responses change with subtle shifts in meaning or context. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often consider related concepts and scenarios to assess our confidence in a particular judgment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a method that generates a diverse set of semantically related queries to probe the model's uncertainty landscape. Given an initial query, SNE uses the LLM itself to generate variations by applying operations such as generalization, specification, analogy, and contrast.

SNE incorporates adaptive sampling to focus on areas of high uncertainty or disagreement within the neighborhood.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require nuanced understanding: (1) Legal Reasoning: A subset of the LexGLUE benchmark, specifically the SCOTUS task. (2) Scientific Hypothesis Generation: The ScienceQA dataset. (3) Moral Dilemmas: The Moral Scenarios dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty quantification methods: (a) Direct prompting with confidence scores, (b) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (c) Ensemble of models.",
            "Step 3: SNE Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Neighborhood Exploration method with the following sub-steps: (a) Query variation generation, (b) Response and confidence score collection, (c) Uncertainty estimation based on neighborhood exploration.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and SNE), generate uncertainty estimates for the test set queries.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: (a) Calibration plots, (b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (c) Brier score, and (d) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for binary classification tasks.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: (a) Comparison of SNE with baselines across different tasks, (b) Investigation of the semantic neighborhood's impact on uncertainty estimates, (c) Analysis of cases where SNE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "In the case of Smith v. Jones, the plaintiff argues that the defendant breached a contract by failing to deliver goods on time. The defendant claims that unforeseen circumstances prevented timely delivery. Based on contract law, who is likely to win the case?",
                "Direct Prompting Output": "Based on the information provided, it's difficult to determine with certainty who would win the case without more details. However, I can provide some general insights based on contract law principles. The plaintiff (Smith) may have a strong case if:\n\n1. The contract had a specific delivery date that was not met.\n2. The contract did not include a force majeure clause that would excuse delays due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the defendant (Jones) might prevail if:\n\n1. The unforeseen circumstances were truly beyond their control and not reasonably foreseeable.\n2. The contract included provisions for excusable delays or force majeure events.\n\nUltimately, the outcome would depend on the specific terms of the contract, the nature of the unforeseen circumstances, and how courts in the relevant jurisdiction have ruled on similar cases. Without more information, I'd estimate a 60% chance that the plaintiff (Smith) would win, assuming standard contract terms and typical judicial interpretations.\n\nConfidence: 60%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score without exploring the nuances of the legal scenario or considering related cases. This can lead to overconfidence in complex legal reasoning tasks."
            },
            "SNE Example": {
                "Input": "In the case of Smith v. Jones, the plaintiff argues that the defendant breached a contract by failing to deliver goods on time. The defendant claims that unforeseen circumstances prevented timely delivery. Based on contract law, who is likely to win the case?",
                "Step 1: Generate Semantic Variations": "1. Generalization: What are the key factors in determining breach of contract cases involving delayed delivery?\n2. Specification: How would the presence of a force majeure clause in the Smith v. Jones contract affect the case outcome?\n3. Analogy: In a similar case where a supplier failed to deliver due to a natural disaster, how did the court rule?\n4. Contrast: How would the case differ if the defendant had partially delivered the goods but missed the deadline?",
                "Step 2: Collect Responses and Confidence Scores": "(For each variation, collect responses and confidence scores from the LLM)",
                "Step 3: Estimate Uncertainty": "Based on the responses to semantic variations, SNE might produce an output like:\n\nThe uncertainty in this case is high due to the lack of specific details about the contract terms and the nature of the unforeseen circumstances. The presence or absence of a force majeure clause is crucial, as highlighted by the specification query. The analogy to natural disaster cases suggests that courts may be sympathetic to truly unforeseeable events, but the degree of sympathy varies by jurisdiction. The contrast case of partial delivery introduces additional complexity.\n\nConsidering the semantic neighborhood, we estimate:\n- 40% chance plaintiff wins\n- 35% chance defendant wins\n- 25% chance of settlement or need for further legal proceedings\n\nUncertainty: High (0.75 on a scale of 0 to 1)\n\nThis high uncertainty stems from the variability in responses across the semantic neighborhood and the identification of critical factors (e.g., force majeure clause) that could significantly sway the case outcome.",
                "Explanation": "SNE provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by exploring related scenarios and identifying key factors that influence the case outcome. This approach captures the complexity of legal reasoning better than a single confidence score."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SNE method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: (1) Examining the quality and diversity of generated semantic variations to ensure they effectively probe the model's uncertainty. (2) Analyzing cases where SNE performs poorly to identify potential improvements in the variation generation or uncertainty aggregation steps. (3) Investigating whether certain types of tasks or queries benefit more from SNE than others, which could lead to a hybrid approach combining SNE with other methods. (4) Exploring alternative ways to aggregate information from the semantic neighborhood, such as weighted averaging based on semantic similarity or using more sophisticated statistical methods to combine confidence scores. (5) Conducting ablation studies to determine which components of SNE (e.g., generalization, specification, analogy, contrast) contribute most to improved uncertainty estimates. These analyses could lead to refinements in the SNE method or provide valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty in LLM reasoning, potentially resulting in a paper focused on analyzing the relationship between semantic neighborhoods and model uncertainty."
