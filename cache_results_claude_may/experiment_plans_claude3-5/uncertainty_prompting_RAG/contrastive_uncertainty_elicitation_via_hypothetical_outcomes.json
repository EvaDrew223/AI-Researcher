        "Title": "Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to express nuanced levels of uncertainty, particularly in scenarios where multiple outcomes are plausible but have different likelihoods. This limitation can lead to overconfident or poorly calibrated predictions, potentially misleading users in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in language models typically focus on direct confidence estimation or simple multiple-choice selection, which may not capture the full spectrum of uncertainty in complex scenarios. By prompting the model to consider and contrast multiple hypothetical outcomes, we can elicit more fine-grained uncertainty estimates that capture the relative plausibility of different possibilities. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about alternatives and provide comparative judgments, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty representations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a contrastive uncertainty elicitation process with the following steps: 1) Initial Response: Generate an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Hypothetical Outcome Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple alternative outcomes or answers, including both plausible and less likely options. 3) Pairwise Comparison: For each pair of outcomes, prompt the model to compare their relative likelihoods and explain the reasoning behind the comparison. 4) Uncertainty Landscape Mapping: Based on the pairwise comparisons, prompt the model to construct an 'uncertainty landscape' that visually or textually represents the relative plausibility of all considered outcomes. 5) Contrastive Confidence Calibration: Use the uncertainty landscape to generate a final calibrated confidence estimate that accounts for the full spectrum of possible outcomes.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering with multiple plausible answers. 2) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for domain-specific knowledge questions. 3) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension with unanswerable questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. 2) Multiple-choice selection: Present the model with several options and ask it to select the most likely one with a confidence score.",
            "Step 3: Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following prompts for each step: 1) Initial Response: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' 2) Hypothetical Outcome Generation: 'Generate 3-5 alternative answers to the question, including both plausible and less likely options: [QUESTION]' 3) Pairwise Comparison: 'Compare the likelihood of the following pair of answers and explain your reasoning: [ANSWER A] vs [ANSWER B]' 4) Uncertainty Landscape Mapping: 'Based on the pairwise comparisons, create a textual representation of the relative plausibility of all considered outcomes.' 5) Contrastive Confidence Calibration: 'Given the uncertainty landscape, provide a final calibrated confidence score from 0 to 100 for your initial answer.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration Error: Measure of how well the model's confidence scores align with its actual accuracy. 3) Brier Score: A proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 4) Uncertainty Resolution: A measure of how well the model distinguishes between different levels of uncertainty.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run the baseline methods and collect results. 2) Run the proposed contrastive uncertainty elicitation method and collect results. 3) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and proposed methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze the generated uncertainty landscapes to assess their coherence and informativeness. 3) Examine cases where the proposed method significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines. 4) Investigate the relationship between the number of alternative outcomes generated and the quality of uncertainty estimates."

            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 was awarded jointly to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger for their work on quantum entanglement. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 2: Hypothetical Outcome Generation)": "Generate 3-5 alternative answers to the question, including both plausible and less likely options: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 2: Hypothetical Outcome Generation)": "1. Giorgio Parisi, Klaus Hasselmann, and Syukuro Manabe\n2. David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian\n3. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier\n4. Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, and Andrea Ghez\n5. No Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 3: Pairwise Comparison)": "Compare the likelihood of the following pair of answers and explain your reasoning: 'Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger' vs 'Giorgio Parisi, Klaus Hasselmann, and Syukuro Manabe'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 3: Pairwise Comparison)": "The answer 'Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger' is more likely to be correct for the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Reasoning: 1) This trio is known for their groundbreaking experiments in quantum entanglement, a hot topic in recent years. 2) Their work aligns with the Nobel Committee's trend of recognizing quantum physics research. 3) Giorgio Parisi, Klaus Hasselmann, and Syukuro Manabe were actually awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2021 for their work on complex systems and climate modeling, making it highly unlikely they would win again in 2022.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 4: Uncertainty Landscape Mapping)": "Based on the pairwise comparisons, create a textual representation of the relative plausibility of all considered outcomes for the question: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 4: Uncertainty Landscape Mapping)": "1. Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger (Highest plausibility)\n2. Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, and Andrea Ghez (Low plausibility - recent winners but in a different year)\n3. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier (Very low plausibility - winners in Chemistry, not Physics)\n4. David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian (Very low plausibility - winners in Physiology or Medicine, not Physics)\n5. Giorgio Parisi, Klaus Hasselmann, and Syukuro Manabe (Very low plausibility - winners in the previous year)\n6. No Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Extremely low plausibility - Nobel Prizes continued during the pandemic)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 5: Contrastive Confidence Calibration)": "Given the uncertainty landscape, provide a final calibrated confidence score from 0 to 100 for your initial answer that Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation; Step 5: Contrastive Confidence Calibration)": "Final calibrated confidence score: 99. The uncertainty landscape strongly supports the initial answer, with all alternative options having very low plausibility. The slight reduction from 100 accounts for the small possibility of unforeseen circumstances or errors in the model's knowledge.",
            "explanation": "The contrastive uncertainty elicitation process allows the model to consider multiple alternatives and their relative likelihoods, leading to a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence estimate. The final calibrated score of 99 reflects a very high confidence, but also acknowledges the small possibility of error, which is more realistic than the initial 95% confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed contrastive uncertainty elicitation method does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can explore several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the generated uncertainty landscapes to understand why they might not be effectively capturing the true uncertainty. This could involve categorizing the types of alternative outcomes generated and their relevance to the question at hand. Second, we could investigate whether the pairwise comparisons are providing meaningful information, or if they're prone to certain biases or inconsistencies. Third, we could explore different ways of aggregating the pairwise comparisons into the final confidence score, potentially incorporating techniques from social choice theory or probabilistic graphical models. Additionally, we could consider expanding the project to include a meta-analysis of when and why the contrastive approach works or fails, which could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of large language models in reasoning about uncertainty. Finally, we could investigate whether the effectiveness of the method varies across different types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more nuanced understanding of how to elicit well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from language models."
