    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often display overconfidence in their responses, even when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs that should reduce their certainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on improving confidence calibration through training or simple prompting, without actively challenging the model's confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by stress testing in engineering and finance, we can design prompts that actively challenge the model's confidence by introducing adversarial elements.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing (ACST), a multi-step prompting technique. First, we prompt the model to answer a question and provide its confidence. Then, we introduce a series of 'stress test' prompts that present potential flaws or contradictions in the initial answer, such as 'Consider this contradictory evidence:' or 'What if this assumption is wrong:'. After each stress test, we prompt the model to reassess its confidence. Finally, we ask the model to synthesize a final answer and confidence level, explaining how the stress tests influenced its uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ACST on a range of tasks, including factual QA and reasoning problems. Compare against standard prompting and other confidence calibration methods using metrics like expected calibration error and adaptive calibration error. Also, measure the method's robustness to out-of-distribution inputs."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence in their responses, even when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs that should reduce their certainty. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improving confidence calibration in LLMs typically focus on training-time interventions or simple prompting techniques. However, these methods often fail to actively challenge the model's confidence, particularly in scenarios where the model should express uncertainty. Inspired by stress testing in engineering and finance, we propose a novel prompting method that actively challenges the model's confidence by introducing adversarial elements. This approach aims to leverage the model's own reasoning capabilities to improve its uncertainty quantification without requiring additional training or external models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing (ACST), a multi-step prompting technique designed to improve uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Initial Response: Prompt the model to answer a question and provide its confidence level. 2) Stress Test Generation: Generate a series of 'stress test' prompts that present potential flaws or contradictions in the initial answer. 3) Iterative Reassessment: After each stress test, prompt the model to reassess its confidence. 4) Final Synthesis: Ask the model to synthesize a final answer and confidence level, explaining how the stress tests influenced its uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of datasets to evaluate ACST: a) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, b) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, c) StrategyQA for multi-step reasoning, and d) Out-of-distribution samples from these datasets by introducing irrelevant or contradictory information.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement the following baselines: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Temperature scaling for confidence calibration, c) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: ACST Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of ACST: a) Initial response prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): [QUESTION]', b) Stress test generation prompt: 'Generate 3 potential flaws or contradictions for the following answer: [INITIAL_ANSWER]', c) Reassessment prompt: 'Given this potential flaw: [STRESS_TEST], reassess your confidence in your original answer.', d) Final synthesis prompt: 'Considering the original question, your initial answer, and the stress tests, provide a final answer and confidence level. Explain how the stress tests influenced your uncertainty.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include Claude from Anthropic as an additional model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), b) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), c) Brier Score, d) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for confidence ranking.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and record results, b) Implement ACST and record results for each step, c) Compare final ACST results with baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare ACST performance against baselines across different datasets and models, b) Analyze the impact of each stress test on confidence reassessment, c) Evaluate the quality and relevance of generated stress tests, d) Assess the model's ability to synthesize final answers and explain uncertainty changes."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 100%",
            "ACST Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and confidence level (0-100%).",
            "ACST Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 100%",
            "ACST Prompt Input (Step 2: Stress Test Generation)": "Generate 3 potential flaws or contradictions for the following answer: 'The capital of France is Paris.'",
            "ACST Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Stress Test Generation)": "1. Historical perspective: 'Paris hasn't always been the capital of France. What if there was a recent change?'\n2. Alternative interpretations: 'France might have multiple capitals for different purposes (e.g., administrative vs. cultural).'\n3. Potential misinformation: 'There could be outdated or incorrect information circulating about France's capital.'",
            "ACST Prompt Input (Step 3: Reassessment)": "Given this potential flaw: 'Paris hasn't always been the capital of France. What if there was a recent change?', reassess your confidence in your original answer.",
            "ACST Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Reassessment)": "After considering the potential flaw, I would reassess my confidence level to 95%. While it's true that Paris hasn't always been the capital of France historically, and there's a theoretical possibility of a very recent change, I'm still highly confident that Paris remains the capital. However, I've slightly reduced my confidence to account for the small chance of a very recent, unannounced change.",
            "ACST Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Considering the original question 'What is the capital of France?', your initial answer, and the stress tests, provide a final answer and confidence level. Explain how the stress tests influenced your uncertainty.",
            "ACST Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 98%\n\nExplanation: The stress tests influenced my uncertainty in the following ways:\n1. Historical perspective: This reminded me that capitals can change over time, slightly reducing my confidence.\n2. Alternative interpretations: While France could theoretically have multiple 'capitals' for different purposes, Paris is generally recognized as the primary capital.\n3. Potential misinformation: This stress test had minimal impact, as the status of Paris as France's capital is widely known and verified.\n\nOverall, these considerations led me to slightly reduce my confidence from 100% to 98%. While I remain highly confident that Paris is the capital of France, I acknowledge the small possibility of very recent changes or alternative interpretations that I might not be aware of."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ACST does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and diversity of generated stress tests to ensure they are sufficiently challenging and relevant. 2) Analyzing the model's reasoning process during reassessment to identify potential flaws or biases. 3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from ACST than others. Based on these findings, we could refine the ACST method, perhaps by incorporating domain-specific knowledge into stress test generation or by developing a more structured approach to confidence reassessment. Additionally, we could explore combining ACST with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibrated few-shot learning, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods."
