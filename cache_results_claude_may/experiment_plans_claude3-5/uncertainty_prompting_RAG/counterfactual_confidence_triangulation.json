        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately assess their confidence when faced with subtle variations in input that might invalidate their reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on direct confidence estimation or limited perturbation analysis.",
        "Motivation": "Robust confidence estimation requires understanding how small changes in premises might affect conclusions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Triangulation (CCT), a prompting technique that generates and explores counterfactual scenarios to probe the model's confidence. Given an initial query and response, CCT prompts the model to generate multiple counterfactual variations that would change the answer. It then evaluates the model's confidence on these variations, as well as on closely related scenarios where the answer should remain unchanged. By triangulating confidence across the original query and these counterfactuals, CCT provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate that captures the model's robustness to small perturbations in the problem space.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test CCT on reasoning tasks sensitive to premise changes, such as ethical dilemmas, causal inference problems, and logic puzzles. Compare against standard confidence estimation techniques using calibration metrics, robustness to adversarial inputs, and correlation with human judgments of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Triangulation: Robust Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately assess their confidence when faced with subtle variations in input that might invalidate their reasoning. This leads to overconfident predictions on edge cases and potential misinformation spread. Existing methods for confidence estimation in LLMs are limited in their ability to capture the nuanced impact of small changes in the problem space on the model's certainty.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence scoring or limited perturbation analysis. These methods often fail to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty, especially in cases where small changes in the input can significantly alter the validity of the model's reasoning. Our proposed method, Counterfactual Confidence Triangulation (CCT), is inspired by human reasoning processes where we consider alternative scenarios to gauge our confidence. By systematically generating and exploring counterfactual variations, CCT aims to provide a more comprehensive and robust measure of uncertainty that reflects the model's resilience to perturbations in the problem space.",
        "Proposed Method": "Counterfactual Confidence Triangulation (CCT) is a prompting technique that generates and explores counterfactual scenarios to probe the model's confidence. The method consists of the following steps:\n1. Initial Query: Present the original question to the LLM and obtain its response and confidence score.\n2. Counterfactual Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate multiple counterfactual variations that would change the answer.\n3. Invariant Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate closely related scenarios where the answer should remain unchanged.\n4. Confidence Evaluation: Evaluate the model's confidence on the counterfactual and invariant scenarios.\n5. Triangulation: Combine the confidence scores from the original query, counterfactuals, and invariants to produce a final, more nuanced uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of reasoning tasks sensitive to premise changes, including:\n- Ethical dilemmas from the Moral Scenarios dataset\n- Causal inference problems from the COPA dataset\n- Logic puzzles from the LogiQA dataset",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques:\n- Direct confidence scoring: Use the model's softmax output or perplexity as a confidence measure\n- Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and use the variance of multiple forward passes as a measure of uncertainty\n- Ensemble Methods: Use an ensemble of models and measure disagreement",
            "Step 3: CCT Implementation": "Implement the CCT method:\n1. Initial Query Prompt: \"Question: [QUESTION] Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).\"\n2. Counterfactual Generation Prompt: \"Generate 3 variations of the original scenario that would change the answer. Ensure the variations are subtle but impactful.\"\n3. Invariant Generation Prompt: \"Generate 3 variations of the original scenario where the answer should remain the same. Ensure the variations are different but maintain the core reasoning.\"\n4. Confidence Evaluation Prompt: \"For each of the following scenarios, provide your answer and confidence level (0-100%): [COUNTERFACTUAL/INVARIANT SCENARIOS]\"\n5. Implement the triangulation algorithm to combine confidence scores",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Assess the performance of CCT against baselines using:\n- Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)\n- Robustness to adversarial inputs: Generate subtle adversarial examples and measure confidence shift\n- Correlation with human judgments: Collect human uncertainty ratings for a subset of problems and compute correlation with model estimates\n- Selective prediction performance: Plot accuracy vs. confidence curves and compute area under the curve",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis:\n- Compare CCT performance across different reasoning tasks\n- Analyze the quality and diversity of generated counterfactuals and invariants\n- Investigate cases where CCT significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines\n- Examine the impact of the number of counterfactuals/invariants on performance"

                "Input": "In a trolley problem scenario, a runaway trolley is headed towards five people tied to the tracks. You can pull a lever to divert the trolley to another track where it will kill one person instead. Should you pull the lever? Provide your answer and confidence level (0-100%).",

By diverting the trolley, we save five lives at the cost of one, which results in a net positive outcome in terms of lives saved. Confidence: 85%",

                    "Input": "Generate 3 variations of the original scenario that would change the answer. Ensure the variations are subtle but impactful.",
                    "Output": "1. The single person on the other track is a brilliant scientist on the verge of curing cancer, while the five people are elderly patients with terminal illnesses.\n2.

Answer: Yes, switch the tracks. Confidence: 85%\n5. Answer: Yes, pull the lever. Confidence: 80%\n6. Answer: Yes, pull the lever. Confidence: 75%"
                },
                "Step 5: Triangulation": "The final confidence score would be calculated based on the original confidence (85%) and the variations in confidence across counterfactuals (70%, 95%, 60%) and invariants (85%, 80%, 75%). A possible triangulation method could be: Final Confidence = Original Confidence * (Average Invariant Confidence / 100) * (1 - Standard Deviation of All Confidences). This would result in a lower, more nuanced confidence score that takes into account the model's sensitivity to scenario variations.",
                "Explanation": "CCT provides a more robust confidence estimate by considering how the model's certainty changes with subtle variations in the scenario. This captures the model's sensitivity to important ethical considerations and potential edge cases, resulting in a more reliable measure of uncertainty."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCT method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analysis of Counterfactuals: Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand what types of variations are most effective in revealing model uncertainty. This could lead to insights on the reasoning capabilities and blind spots of LLMs.\n2. Improved Triangulation Algorithms: Experiment with different methods of combining confidence scores from the original query, counterfactuals, and invariants. This could involve weighted averaging, non-linear combinations, or learning a meta-model to predict the final confidence score.\n3. Task-Specific Uncertainty: Investigate how the effectiveness of CCT varies across different types of reasoning tasks. This could lead to the development of task-specific uncertainty estimation techniques.\n4. Human-AI Comparison: Compare the sensitivity of human confidence to counterfactual scenarios with that of LLMs. This could provide insights into the differences between human and AI reasoning under uncertainty.\n5. Uncertainty-Aware Prompting: Develop prompting strategies that incorporate the generated counterfactuals to improve the model's reasoning and reduce overconfidence in subsequent interactions."
