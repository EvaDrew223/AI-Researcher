        "Title": "Adaptive Granularity Confidence Estimation (AGCE): Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide uniform confidence estimates across queries, failing to adapt to the varying levels of specificity or complexity in different questions. This leads to inaccurate uncertainty quantification, especially for complex or ambiguous queries.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use fixed confidence scales or single-step estimation methods, which are inadequate for capturing the nuanced uncertainty levels across diverse query types. By dynamically adjusting the granularity of confidence estimation based on the query's characteristics, we can achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to analyze and adapt to the query, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adaptive Granularity Confidence Estimation (AGCE), a multi-step prompting method: 1) Query Analysis: Prompt the LLM to analyze the query's complexity, specificity, and domain(s). 2) Granularity Selection: Based on the analysis, prompt the LLM to choose an appropriate confidence estimation approach (e.g., coarse 3-point scale, fine-grained percentage, or decomposition into sub-queries). 3) Confidence Elicitation: Apply the selected method to generate a confidence estimate. 4) Justification: Prompt the LLM to explain why the chosen granularity is appropriate for the given query and how it affects the interpretation of the confidence estimate. 5) Meta-confidence: Finally, prompt the LLM to assess its confidence in the appropriateness of the chosen estimation method.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of queries from existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, TriviaQA, and BoolQ. Ensure a mix of simple factual questions, complex reasoning tasks, and ambiguous queries. Aim for at least 1000 queries across different domains and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Fixed 5-point scale confidence estimation, where the LLM is asked to provide a confidence score from 1 to 5 for each query. 2) Percentage-based confidence estimation, where the LLM is asked to provide a confidence percentage for each query.",
            "Step 3: AGCE Implementation": "Implement the AGCE method using the following prompts for each step: 1) Query Analysis: 'Analyze the following query in terms of its complexity, specificity, and domain(s): [QUERY]' 2) Granularity Selection: 'Based on your analysis, choose the most appropriate confidence estimation method from the following options: a) Coarse 3-point scale, b) Fine-grained percentage, c) Decomposition into sub-queries. Explain your choice.' 3) Confidence Elicitation: Use the chosen method to generate a confidence estimate. 4) Justification: 'Explain why the chosen granularity is appropriate for this query and how it affects the interpretation of the confidence estimate.' 5) Meta-confidence: 'Assess your confidence in the appropriateness of the chosen estimation method on a scale of 1-10.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess the method's effectiveness across different model sizes.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Accuracy: Compare the model's answers against ground truth. 2) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure how well the confidence estimates align with actual accuracy. 3) Discrimination: Use Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) to measure how well the confidence estimates distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. 4) Granularity Appropriateness: Have human evaluators rate the appropriateness of the chosen granularity on a scale of 1-5 for a subset of queries.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each query in the dataset: 1) Apply both baseline methods and record the confidence estimates. 2) Apply the AGCE method, recording the outputs from each step. 3) Generate the model's answer to the query. 4) Calculate the evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of AGCE against the baselines using the defined metrics. 2) Analyze how the chosen granularity varies across different query types and domains. 3) Examine the correlation between meta-confidence scores and actual performance. 4) Identify cases where AGCE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines, and analyze the reasons."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Fixed 5-point scale)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is least confident and 5 is most confident.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Fixed 5-point scale)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 5",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Percentage-based)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence as a percentage.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Percentage-based)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AGCE; Step 1: Query Analysis)": "Analyze the following query in terms of its complexity, specificity, and domain(s): What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AGCE; Step 1: Query Analysis)": "This query is: 1) Low complexity: It's a straightforward factual question. 2) High specificity: It asks for a specific piece of information (the capital city) about a specific country (France). 3) Domain: Geography, specifically political geography.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AGCE; Step 2: Granularity Selection)": "Based on your analysis, choose the most appropriate confidence estimation method from the following options: a) Coarse 3-point scale, b) Fine-grained percentage, c) Decomposition into sub-queries. Explain your choice.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AGCE; Step 2: Granularity Selection)": "For this query, I choose option a) Coarse 3-point scale. This is appropriate because: 1) The question is straightforward and factual, not requiring nuanced confidence levels. 2) The answer is likely to be either known with high confidence or not known at all, making a simple low/medium/high scale sufficient. 3) A more granular scale or decomposition would be unnecessary for such a specific, low-complexity question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AGCE; Step 3: Confidence Elicitation)": "What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and confidence using a 3-point scale (low, medium, high).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AGCE; Step 3: Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: High",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AGCE; Step 4: Justification)": "Explain why the chosen granularity (3-point scale) is appropriate for this query and how it affects the interpretation of the confidence estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AGCE; Step 4: Justification)": "The 3-point scale is appropriate for this query because it's a straightforward factual question about basic geography. This type of information is typically either known with high confidence or not known at all. The chosen granularity affects the interpretation as follows: A 'high' confidence suggests that the model is very sure of its answer, which is expected for such a well-known fact. A 'medium' confidence would indicate some uncertainty, which would be unusual for this question and might prompt further verification. A 'low' confidence would suggest the model is guessing, which would be a red flag for such a basic question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AGCE; Step 5: Meta-confidence)": "Assess your confidence in the appropriateness of the chosen estimation method (3-point scale) for the question 'What is the capital of France?' on a scale of 1-10.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AGCE; Step 5: Meta-confidence)": "Meta-confidence: 9/10. I'm highly confident that a 3-point scale is appropriate for this simple, factual question. It provides sufficient granularity without overcomplicating the confidence estimation for a straightforward query.",
            "explanation": "The AGCE method provides a more nuanced and justified confidence estimation compared to the baselines. It adapts the granularity to the query's characteristics and provides explanations for its choices, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the AGCE method doesn't show significant improvements over the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the cases where AGCE performs differently from baselines, focusing on understanding the types of queries where adaptive granularity is most/least beneficial. 2) Investigate the relationship between the query analysis step and the final performance, potentially revealing insights about how LLMs perceive query complexity and how this relates to their actual performance. 3) Analyze the meta-confidence scores and their correlation with performance, which could provide insights into the model's self-awareness of its estimation capabilities. 4) Explore alternative adaptive methods, such as using the query analysis to directly inform the confidence estimation without the explicit granularity selection step. This could lead to a simplified version of AGCE that might be more robust. 5) Investigate how different prompting strategies for each step of AGCE affect the overall performance, potentially uncovering better ways to elicit useful information from the LLM for confidence estimation."
