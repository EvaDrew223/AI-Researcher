        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when making predictions that involve temporal reasoning or future events.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on static confidence estimation or use simple ensemble methods for uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging the model's ability to reason about different time points and potential future scenarios, we can obtain a more nuanced understanding of its uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Estimation (TDUE), a novel prompting method that asks the model to generate predictions for multiple future time points and analyzes the divergence between these predictions. The process involves: 1) Prompting the model to make predictions for the same query at different future time points (e.g., 1 month, 6 months, 1 year from now). 2) Calculating the semantic and factual divergence between these predictions using additional prompts. 3) Estimating uncertainty based on the degree of divergence, with higher divergence indicating greater uncertainty. 4) Incorporating a 'temporal stability score' by prompting the model to assess how likely its prediction is to change over time.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare TDUE with standard uncertainty estimation methods on datasets involving temporal reasoning and future predictions, such as forecasting tasks. Evaluate using metrics like calibration error and Brier score, as well as human evaluation of the generated uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Estimation: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models for Future Predictions",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when making predictions that involve temporal reasoning or future events. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks requiring forecasting or long-term reasoning, where the model's confidence may not align with the actual likelihood of its predictions being correct.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in language models mainly focus on static confidence estimation or use simple ensemble methods. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty in temporal predictions. By leveraging the model's ability to reason about different time points and potential future scenarios, we can obtain a more sophisticated understanding of its uncertainty. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we naturally consider how our predictions might change over time when assessing our confidence in future events.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Estimation (TDUE), a novel prompting method that asks the model to generate predictions for multiple future time points and analyzes the divergence between these predictions. The process involves four main steps: 1) Prompting the model to make predictions for the same query at different future time points (e.g., 1 month, 6 months, 1 year from now). 2) Calculating the semantic and factual divergence between these predictions using additional prompts. 3) Estimating uncertainty based on the degree of divergence, with higher divergence indicating greater uncertainty. 4) Incorporating a 'temporal stability score' by prompting the model to assess how likely its prediction is to change over time.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) ForecastQA: A dataset of questions about future events with ground truth answers. 2) TemporalNLI: A dataset for temporal reasoning in natural language inference. We will filter these datasets to focus on questions that involve predictions about future events or temporal reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard confidence estimation: Use the model's output probability as a measure of confidence. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple forward passes with different prompts and calculate the variance of the outputs as a measure of uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: TDUE Implementation": "Implement the TDUE method with the following sub-steps: a) Generate multi-timepoint predictions: Prompt the model to make predictions for the same query at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year in the future. b) Calculate divergence: Use additional prompts to assess semantic and factual differences between the predictions. c) Estimate uncertainty: Develop a scoring function that translates divergence into an uncertainty score. d) Compute temporal stability: Prompt the model to assess the likelihood of its prediction changing over time.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of TDUE against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. 2) Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect predictions based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the interpretability and perceived usefulness of TDUE's uncertainty estimates compared to baseline methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform an in-depth analysis of the results, focusing on: 1) How TDUE performs across different types of temporal reasoning tasks. 2) The relationship between temporal divergence and prediction accuracy. 3) The impact of the temporal stability score on overall uncertainty estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Will the United States have a female president by 2028?",
                "Output (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "Based on current trends and the increasing number of women in high-level political positions, it is possible that the United States could have a female president by 2028. However, it's not certain. I would estimate the likelihood at about 60%.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single point estimate of confidence without considering how this prediction might change over time or exploring different scenarios."
            },
            "TDUE Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Will the United States have a female president by 2028?",
                "Output (TDUE Step 1: Multi-timepoint Predictions)": "1 month from now: It's too early to say with certainty, but based on current political landscape, there's about a 40% chance of a female US president by 2028.\n6 months from now: With primary elections approaching, we have a clearer picture of potential candidates. The likelihood has increased to about 50%.\n1 year from now: After the primaries, if a strong female candidate has secured a major party nomination, the probability could be as high as 65%.",
                "Output (TDUE Step 2: Divergence Calculation)": "Semantic Divergence: Moderate (0.6/1.0) - The core prediction remains similar, but the probabilities change significantly.\nFactual Divergence: Low (0.2/1.0) - No contradictory facts are presented across timepoints.",
                "Output (TDUE Step 3: Uncertainty Estimation)": "Based on the moderate semantic divergence and low factual divergence, the uncertainty score is 0.7 on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates maximum uncertainty.",
                "Output (TDUE Step 4: Temporal Stability)": "The prediction shows moderate instability over time, with a 60% chance of significant change within the next year as political events unfold.",
                "Final TDUE Output": "Prediction: There is a 50-65% chance of a female US president by 2028, with an uncertainty score of 0.7 and a 60% chance of this prediction changing significantly within the next year.",
                "Explanation": "TDUE provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty by considering how the prediction might evolve over time and quantifying the divergence between these temporal predictions. It also offers a measure of how stable this prediction is likely to be, giving users a more comprehensive understanding of the model's confidence."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TDUE does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a thorough error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining cases where TDUE performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines. We could also explore variations of TDUE, such as using different time intervals or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the temporal predictions. Additionally, we could investigate whether TDUE's performance varies across different types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when temporal reasoning is most crucial for uncertainty estimation. If these analyses don't yield improvements, we could pivot to a comparative study of different uncertainty estimation methods in temporal reasoning tasks, providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in this challenging domain."
