        "Problem": "LLMs often provide uniform confidence estimates across different granularities of knowledge, failing to capture the hierarchical nature of certainty in complex domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on global calibration or simple hierarchical decompositions, which may not capture the full complexity of nested uncertainties.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from fractal geometry, we propose that confidence in knowledge domains often exhibits self-similar patterns at different scales, which can be exploited for more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Confidence Elicitation (FCE), a recursive prompting strategy that: 1) Starts with a high-level query and progressively decomposes it into sub-queries. 2) At each level, prompts the model to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. 3) Recursively applies this process to sub-queries, creating a fractal-like tree of nested confidences. 4) Aggregates confidence estimates bottom-up, using a novel fractal dimension-inspired metric to capture the self-similarity of confidence patterns. 5) Uses the fractal confidence structure to calibrate the model's final confidence estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare FCE against flat and simple hierarchical confidence estimation methods on complex, hierarchical tasks like multi-hop reasoning and nested fact verification. Evaluate improvements in calibration and the method's ability to identify areas of high uncertainty at different granularities."

        "Title": "Fractal Confidence Elicitation: Hierarchical Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide uniform confidence estimates across different granularities of knowledge, failing to capture the hierarchical nature of certainty in complex domains. This leads to unreliable uncertainty quantification, especially in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or nested knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on global calibration or simple hierarchical decompositions, which may not capture the full complexity of nested uncertainties. Drawing inspiration from fractal geometry, we propose that confidence in knowledge domains often exhibits self-similar patterns at different scales, which can be exploited for more nuanced uncertainty quantification. This approach could potentially provide a more accurate representation of an LLM's confidence across different levels of knowledge granularity, leading to better-calibrated and more interpretable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Confidence Elicitation (FCE), a recursive prompting strategy that: 1) Starts with a high-level query and progressively decomposes it into sub-queries. 2) At each level, prompts the model to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. 3) Recursively applies this process to sub-queries, creating a fractal-like tree of nested confidences. 4) Aggregates confidence estimates bottom-up, using a novel fractal dimension-inspired metric to capture the self-similarity of confidence patterns. 5) Uses the fractal confidence structure to calibrate the model's final confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require multi-hop reasoning or nested knowledge: 1) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, 2) StrategyQA for strategic reasoning, and 3) MATH dataset for mathematical problem-solving. These datasets will be preprocessed to include ground truth decompositions of questions into sub-questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation at the final step, and 3) Simple hierarchical decomposition with confidence estimation at each level (but without fractal aggregation).",
            "Step 3: FCE Implementation": "Implement the Fractal Confidence Elicitation method: a) Design prompts for recursive question decomposition, b) Implement confidence estimation at each level, c) Develop the fractal dimension-inspired aggregation metric, d) Create the final calibration step using the fractal confidence structure.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods, b) Run FCE method, c) Collect predictions and confidence estimates at all levels.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: a) Accuracy of final answers, b) Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), c) Confidence resolution across different granularities, d) Correlation between fractal confidence structure and answer correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: a) Compare FCE against baselines, b) Analyze the fractal confidence patterns across different question types and difficulties, c) Investigate the relationship between fractal dimension and prediction reliability."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a hotel in a city that was once the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. Which city is this?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The city is Hampi. Confidence: 0.8",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FCE Step 1)": "Q: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a hotel in a city that was once the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. Which city is this? Please decompose this question into smaller sub-questions that would help answer the main question. For each sub-question, provide an answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FCE Step 1)": "Sub-questions:\n1. Who is the Oberoi family? A: The Oberoi family is a prominent Indian business family known for their luxury hotel chain. Confidence: 0.95\n2. What hotel company is associated with the Oberoi family? A: The Oberoi Group (officially EIH Limited). Confidence: 0.9\n3. What was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire? A: Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. Confidence: 0.85\n4. Does the Oberoi Group have a hotel in Hampi? A: Yes, The Oberoi Vanyavilas Wildlife Resort is located near Hampi. Confidence: 0.75",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FCE Step 2)": "Based on the sub-questions and answers, what is the final answer to the main question? Provide a confidence score for the final answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FCE Step 2)": "Final Answer: The city is Hampi. Confidence: 0.82",
            "Explanation": "FCE allows for a more nuanced confidence estimation by breaking down the question into sub-components and aggregating the confidences. This approach captures uncertainties at different levels of the reasoning process, potentially leading to a more accurate overall confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed FCE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why FCE fails, which could provide insights into the limitations of hierarchical confidence estimation in LLMs. 2) Explore alternative aggregation methods for the fractal confidence structure, such as weighted averaging based on the relevance of sub-questions. 3) Investigate the relationship between question complexity (e.g., depth of decomposition) and the effectiveness of FCE, which could lead to a hybrid approach where different confidence estimation methods are used based on question characteristics. 4) Extend the study to examine how FCE performs across different types of tasks or domains, which could reveal task-specific patterns in hierarchical uncertainty. These alternative directions would still provide valuable insights into LLM confidence estimation and could potentially lead to novel approaches for improving model calibration."
