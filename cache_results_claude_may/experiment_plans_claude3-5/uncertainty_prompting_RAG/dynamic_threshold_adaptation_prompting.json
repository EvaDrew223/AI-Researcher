        "Problem": "LLMs often use static, predefined thresholds for confidence estimation, which fail to adapt to the varying difficulty and ambiguity levels across different tasks and contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically employ fixed confidence thresholds or simple scaling techniques that don't account for task-specific nuances.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by dynamic threshold adaptation in human decision-making and signal detection theory, we propose a method that adjusts confidence thresholds based on task characteristics and model performance.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Dynamic Threshold Adaptation Prompting (DTAP), a technique that iteratively refines confidence thresholds through a series of calibration prompts. DTAP begins by asking the model to propose initial thresholds for different confidence levels (e.g., 'very confident', 'somewhat confident', 'uncertain') based on the given task description. It then presents the model with a small set of carefully designed calibration examples, prompting it to classify its confidence using these thresholds and explain its reasoning. Based on the model's performance on these examples, DTAP generates meta-prompts that encourage the model to reflect on and adjust its thresholds. This process is repeated, with each iteration introducing more challenging or ambiguous examples. The final set of thresholds is then used to calibrate the model's confidence estimates on the actual task.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DTAP across a diverse set of tasks, including both well-defined benchmarks and more open-ended, ambiguous queries. We'll compare it to static thresholding approaches and other dynamic calibration methods using standard metrics like ECE and Brier Score. We'll also introduce new metrics to assess the adaptability and robustness of the thresholds across different task types. Additionally, we'll conduct a detailed analysis of the threshold adjustment process and the model's meta-reflections to gain insights into its calibration strategies."

        "Title": "Dynamic Threshold Adaptation Prompting: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often use static, predefined thresholds for confidence estimation, which fail to adapt to the varying difficulty and ambiguity levels across different tasks and contexts. This leads to poor calibration and unreliable uncertainty quantification, potentially resulting in overconfident errors or underconfident correct responses.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically employ fixed confidence thresholds or simple scaling techniques that don't account for task-specific nuances. Inspired by dynamic threshold adaptation in human decision-making and signal detection theory, we propose a method that adjusts confidence thresholds based on task characteristics and model performance. This approach aims to leverage the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to dynamically calibrate its confidence estimates, potentially leading to more accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification across diverse tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Dynamic Threshold Adaptation Prompting (DTAP), a technique that iteratively refines confidence thresholds through a series of calibration prompts. DTAP begins by asking the model to propose initial thresholds for different confidence levels (e.g., 'very confident', 'somewhat confident', 'uncertain') based on the given task description. It then presents the model with a small set of carefully designed calibration examples, prompting it to classify its confidence using these thresholds and explain its reasoning. Based on the model's performance on these examples, DTAP generates meta-prompts that encourage the model to reflect on and adjust its thresholds. This process is repeated, with each iteration introducing more challenging or ambiguous examples. The final set of thresholds is then used to calibrate the model's confidence estimates on the actual task.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare datasets for three diverse task types: (1) Factual QA using Natural Questions (NQ), (2) Commonsense reasoning using COPA, and (3) Mathematical problem-solving using GSM8K. For each dataset, create a small calibration set (50-100 examples) with varying difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Static thresholding: Use fixed confidence thresholds (e.g., >0.9 for 'very confident', 0.6-0.9 for 'somewhat confident', <0.6 for 'uncertain'). (2) Temperature scaling: Apply temperature scaling to the model's output probabilities.",
            "Step 3: DTAP Implementation": "Implement the DTAP method with the following sub-steps: (a) Initial threshold proposal, (b) Calibration example classification, (c) Threshold adjustment, (d) Iteration, (e) Final threshold application.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task and model: (a) Run baseline methods, (b) Run DTAP method, (c) Apply final thresholds to the test set.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate using: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (2) Brier Score, (3) Accuracy-Confidence correlation, (4) Threshold stability across iterations.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis: (a) Compare DTAP performance against baselines, (b) Analyze threshold adjustment patterns, (c) Examine model's meta-reflections during the process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and confidence level (very confident, somewhat confident, or uncertain).",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: Very confident.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method uses static thresholds, which may not adapt well to different question types or difficulties."
            },
            "DTAP Example": {
                "Step 1: Initial Threshold Proposal": {
                    "Input": "For a general knowledge quiz, propose initial confidence thresholds for 'very confident', 'somewhat confident', and 'uncertain' responses. Explain your reasoning.",
                    "Output": "Initial thresholds:\nVery confident: >85%\nSomewhat confident: 60-85%\nUncertain: <60%\n\nReasoning: For a general knowledge quiz, we want to set a high bar for 'very confident' answers to minimize overconfidence. The 'somewhat confident' range allows for reasonable guesses, while 'uncertain' covers cases where the model has significant doubt."
                },
                "Step 2: Calibration Example Classification": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Classify your confidence using the proposed thresholds and explain why.",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\nConfidence: Very confident (>85%)\nExplanation: This is a widely known fact that I'm certain about. The information is consistently true and frequently encountered in various contexts."
                },
                "Step 3: Threshold Adjustment": {
                    "Input": "Based on your performance on the calibration examples, should the thresholds be adjusted? If so, how and why?",
                    "Output": "After reviewing the calibration examples, I suggest slightly adjusting the thresholds:\nVery confident: >90%\nSomewhat confident: 70-90%\nUncertain: <70%\n\nReasoning: The initial thresholds were too lenient for 'very confident' responses. By increasing this threshold, we ensure that only the most certain answers receive this label. The 'somewhat confident' range is narrowed to better differentiate between moderate and low confidence levels."
                },
                "Step 4: Final Answer with Adjusted Thresholds": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and confidence level using the adjusted thresholds.",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: Very confident (>90%)."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The DTAP method allows for dynamic adjustment of confidence thresholds based on task-specific calibration. This leads to more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence estimates compared to static thresholding."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DTAP doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why dynamic threshold adaptation is challenging for LLMs. We could investigate: (1) The quality and consistency of the model's meta-reflections during threshold adjustment, (2) How performance varies across different task types and difficulty levels, (3) The impact of the number and diversity of calibration examples on threshold stability. Additionally, we could explore alternative approaches, such as using a separate 'calibration model' to adjust thresholds based on the main model's outputs, or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide threshold adaptation. These analyses could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in self-calibration and inform future research directions in this area."
