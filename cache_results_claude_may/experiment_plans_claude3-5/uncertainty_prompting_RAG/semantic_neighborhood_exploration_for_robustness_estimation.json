        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize when they are operating at the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses for queries that are slightly out of their training distribution.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically assess confidence based on the given query alone, without exploring the semantic neighborhood to gauge robustness.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring the semantic neighborhood of a query, we can better estimate the model's robustness and provide more accurate uncertainty estimates for queries that may be near the boundaries of the model's knowledge.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Robustness Estimation (SNERE), a method that probes the model's knowledge and confidence in the semantic vicinity of the original query. The process involves: 1) Semantic neighborhood generation prompt: \"Generate 5-7 queries that are semantically related to the original query, varying in their distance from the original concept.\" 2) Neighborhood probing prompt: \"For each query in the semantic neighborhood, provide an answer and confidence estimate. Explain your reasoning.\" 3) Robustness analysis prompt: \"Analyzing your responses across the semantic neighborhood, assess the robustness of your knowledge in this area. Provide an overall confidence estimate for the original query, taking into account the neighborhood exploration.\" This method encourages the model to recognize areas where its knowledge is patchy or inconsistent, leading to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Create a benchmark dataset with queries deliberately chosen to be at various distances from the core of the model's training distribution. Compare SNERE against standard confidence estimation methods, evaluating both the calibration of estimates and the model's ability to recognize queries at the boundaries of its knowledge. Use metrics like local calibration error and robustness scores, as well as human evaluation of the model's explanations for its confidence estimates across the semantic neighborhood."

        "Title": "SNERE: Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Robust Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize when they are operating at the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses for queries that are slightly out of their training distribution. This overconfidence can result in the propagation of misinformation and unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods typically assess confidence based on the given query alone, without exploring the semantic neighborhood to gauge robustness. By exploring the semantic neighborhood of a query, we can better estimate the model's robustness and provide more accurate uncertainty estimates for queries that may be near the boundaries of the model's knowledge. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often consider related concepts and scenarios to assess our confidence in a particular domain.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Robustness Estimation (SNERE), a method that probes the model's knowledge and confidence in the semantic vicinity of the original query. The process involves three main steps: 1) Semantic neighborhood generation: Generate 5-7 queries that are semantically related to the original query, varying in their distance from the original concept. 2) Neighborhood probing: For each query in the semantic neighborhood, provide an answer and confidence estimate, explaining the reasoning. 3) Robustness analysis: Analyze responses across the semantic neighborhood to assess the robustness of knowledge in this area and provide an overall confidence estimate for the original query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a benchmark dataset with queries deliberately chosen to be at various distances from the core of the model's training distribution. This dataset should cover diverse domains such as science, history, current events, and general knowledge. Include a mix of factual queries, opinion-based questions, and hypothetical scenarios. Annotate each query with its expected 'distance' from the model's core knowledge (e.g., 'core', 'peripheral', 'edge', 'out-of-distribution').",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation methods as baselines: a) Direct confidence scoring: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Softmax temperature scaling: Apply temperature scaling to the model's output logits to calibrate confidence. c) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use multiple model runs or different model checkpoints to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SNERE Implementation": "Implement the SNERE method with the following prompts: a) Semantic neighborhood generation prompt: 'Generate 5-7 queries that are semantically related to the original query: [ORIGINAL_QUERY]. Vary these queries in their distance from the original concept, ranging from closely related to more tangentially connected.' b) Neighborhood probing prompt: 'For each of the following queries, provide an answer and a confidence estimate on a scale of 0-100. Explain your reasoning for each: [LIST_OF_QUERIES]' c) Robustness analysis prompt: 'Analyzing your responses across the semantic neighborhood, assess the robustness of your knowledge in this area. Provide an overall confidence estimate for the original query: [ORIGINAL_QUERY], taking into account the neighborhood exploration. Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, use open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Local calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy in local neighborhoods of the semantic space. b) Robustness score: Compute the variance of model responses across the semantic neighborhood. c) Confidence-accuracy correlation: Calculate the correlation between model confidence and actual accuracy. d) Out-of-distribution detection: Measure the model's ability to identify queries that are out of its training distribution.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the quality of: a) Generated semantic neighborhoods b) Model explanations for confidence estimates c) Overall robustness analysis",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments comparing SNERE against the baseline methods on the prepared dataset. For each query: a) Get baseline confidence estimates b) Apply SNERE method c) Compute evaluation metrics d) Store results for analysis",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform comprehensive analysis of the results: a) Compare SNERE performance against baselines across different query types and 'distances' b) Analyze how semantic neighborhood exploration affects confidence estimates c) Investigate cases where SNERE significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines d) Examine the relationship between neighborhood robustness and overall confidence estimates",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: a) Vary the number of queries in the semantic neighborhood b) Experiment with different prompts for neighborhood generation and robustness analysis c) Test the effect of using different models for different steps of SNERE"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Semantic Neighborhood Generation)": "Generate 5-7 queries that are semantically related to the original query: 'What is the capital of France?'. Vary these queries in their distance from the original concept, ranging from closely related to more tangentially connected.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Semantic Neighborhood Generation)": "1. What is the largest city in France?\n2. Who is the current president of France?\n3. What is the official language of France?\n4. What is the capital of Germany?\n5. Which river runs through Paris?\n6. What is the population of France?\n7. When did France last host the Olympics?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Neighborhood Probing)": "For each of the following queries, provide an answer and a confidence estimate on a scale of 0-100. Explain your reasoning for each:\n1. What is the largest city in France?\n2. Who is the current president of France?\n3. What is the official language of France?\n4. What is the capital of Germany?\n5. Which river runs through Paris?\n6. What is the population of France?\n7. When did France last host the Olympics?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Neighborhood Probing)": "1. The largest city in France is Paris. Confidence: 100. Reasoning: This is a well-known fact that Paris is both the capital and largest city of France.\n2. The current president of France is Emmanuel Macron. Confidence: 95. Reasoning: Macron was elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2022, but there's a small chance of very recent changes.\n3. The official language of France is French. Confidence: 100. Reasoning: This is a fundamental fact about France that hasn't changed in centuries.\n4. The capital of Germany is Berlin. Confidence: 100. Reasoning: This is a well-established fact since the reunification of Germany.\n5. The river that runs through Paris is the Seine. Confidence: 100. Reasoning: The Seine is famously associated with Paris and this fact is widely known.\n6. The population of France is approximately 67 million. Confidence: 90. Reasoning: Population figures can change, and my knowledge might not be up to the exact current number.\n7. France last hosted the Summer Olympics in 2024. Confidence: 95. Reasoning: Paris is scheduled to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, but there's a small chance of very recent changes or cancellations.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Robustness Analysis)": "Analyzing your responses across the semantic neighborhood, assess the robustness of your knowledge in this area. Provide an overall confidence estimate for the original query: 'What is the capital of France?', taking into account the neighborhood exploration. Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Robustness Analysis)": "Overall confidence estimate for 'What is the capital of France?': 100\n\nReasoning: The semantic neighborhood exploration demonstrates a robust and consistent knowledge about France and its capital, Paris. Key points supporting this high confidence:\n\n1. Direct knowledge: The largest city in France is correctly identified as Paris with 100% confidence.\n2. Consistency: The Seine river running through Paris is correctly identified with 100% confidence, further supporting the knowledge about the city.\n3. Broader context: High confidence (95-100%) in related facts about France such as its official language, current president, and upcoming Olympic hosting, indicates a strong overall knowledge about the country.\n4. Comparative knowledge: The correct identification of Berlin as Germany's capital with 100% confidence suggests a reliable understanding of European capitals in general.\n5. No contradictions: None of the related queries produced answers that would cast doubt on Paris being the capital of France.\n6. Historical stability: The fact that Paris has been the capital of France for centuries adds to the confidence, as this is unlikely to have changed recently.\n\nThe slight uncertainties in population figures and very recent events (like the current president or Olympic hosting) do not affect the core knowledge about Paris being the capital. The exploration of the semantic neighborhood thus reinforces the initial high confidence in the answer to the original query.",
            "explanation": "This example demonstrates how SNERE improves confidence estimation by exploring related concepts. While a simple baseline might give high confidence based solely on the direct question, SNERE provides a more robust estimate by considering a range of related knowledge. This approach helps identify potential areas of uncertainty and provides a more nuanced understanding of the model's knowledge boundaries."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SNERE does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the semantic neighborhoods generated by the model. This could reveal insights into how LLMs conceptualize related information and where they struggle with coherence or accuracy. 2) Investigate the relationship between neighborhood diversity and confidence estimation accuracy. This could lead to a paper on optimal strategies for probing model knowledge. 3) Analyze cases where SNERE performs poorly compared to simpler methods. This might reveal specific types of queries or knowledge domains where semantic neighborhood exploration is less effective, leading to insights about the limitations of this approach. 4) Explore alternative ways of aggregating information from the semantic neighborhood, such as weighted averaging based on semantic similarity or using the neighborhood to train a meta-model for confidence estimation. 5) Investigate how SNERE performance varies across different model sizes and architectures, which could provide insights into how model scale affects knowledge robustness and uncertainty estimation."
