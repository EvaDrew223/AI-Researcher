        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different domains and task types, often leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on direct confidence scoring or ensemble methods, which may not capture nuanced uncertainty across different knowledge domains.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, we propose that uncertainty can be more accurately quantified by measuring how an LLM's response 'resonates' with slight variations of the input question across multiple knowledge domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Resonance Mapping (URM), a novel prompting technique that involves: 1) Generating slight variations of the input question across multiple related domains. 2) Prompting the LLM with these variations and measuring the consistency of responses. 3) Constructing an 'uncertainty spectrum' based on the response consistency across domains. 4) Using this spectrum to calibrate the LLM's confidence in its original answer. The prompts are designed to explore conceptual boundaries and interdisciplinary connections, allowing for a more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare URM against baseline confidence estimation methods on diverse benchmarks spanning factual knowledge, reasoning tasks, and open-ended generation. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Resonance Mapping: Quantifying LLM Uncertainty through Multi-Domain Question Variations",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different domains and task types, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers. This issue is particularly problematic in high-stakes applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial for decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence scoring or ensemble methods, which may not capture nuanced uncertainty across different knowledge domains. Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, we propose that uncertainty can be more accurately quantified by measuring how an LLM's response 'resonates' with slight variations of the input question across multiple knowledge domains. This approach leverages the LLM's own knowledge and reasoning capabilities to probe the boundaries of its understanding, potentially offering a more nuanced and accurate measure of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Resonance Mapping (URM), a novel prompting technique that involves: 1) Generating slight variations of the input question across multiple related domains. 2) Prompting the LLM with these variations and measuring the consistency of responses. 3) Constructing an 'uncertainty spectrum' based on the response consistency across domains. 4) Using this spectrum to calibrate the LLM's confidence in its original answer. The prompts are designed to explore conceptual boundaries and interdisciplinary connections, allowing for a more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets that span multiple domains and task types. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for factual knowledge, b) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, c) BoolQ for yes/no questions, and d) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement baseline uncertainty estimation methods: a) Direct confidence scoring: Prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Ensemble method: Use multiple LLM calls with different temperatures and calculate the variance in responses. c) Calibrated probabilities: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the LLM's output probabilities.",
            "Step 3: URM Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Resonance Mapping method: a) Question Variation Generation: For each input question, generate 5 variations that probe related concepts in different domains. Use few-shot prompting to guide the LLM in generating these variations. b) Multi-domain Probing: Query the LLM with the original question and its variations, collecting responses and confidence scores. c) Consistency Measurement: Develop a metric to quantify the consistency of responses across variations. This could involve semantic similarity measures and confidence score comparisons. d) Uncertainty Spectrum Construction: Create an uncertainty spectrum based on the consistency measurements, where high consistency across domains indicates low uncertainty and vice versa. e) Confidence Calibration: Use the uncertainty spectrum to adjust the LLM's confidence in its original answer.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare URM against baseline methods using the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Measure how well the predicted probabilities align with empirical outcomes. b) Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. d) Correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings: On a subset of questions, have human experts rate their uncertainty and compare with model predictions.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: a) Compare URM performance across different domains and task types. b) Analyze cases where URM significantly outperforms or underperforms baseline methods. c) Investigate the relationship between question complexity and URM effectiveness. d) Examine the generated question variations to understand how they contribute to uncertainty quantification."

            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (URM; Step 1: Question Variation Generation)": "Generate 5 variations of the question \"What is the capital of France?\" that probe related concepts in different domains. Each variation should be related but not identical to the original question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (URM; Step 1: Question Variation Generation)": "1. In terms of population size, how does Paris compare to other European capitals?\n2. What role did Paris play in the French Revolution?\n3. How has the architecture of Paris influenced other major cities worldwide?\n4. What are the main economic sectors driving Paris's economy in the 21st century?\n5. How has Paris's status as the capital of France affected its cultural development over time?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (URM; Step 2: Multi-domain Probing)": "Please answer the following questions and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each answer:\n1. What is the capital of France?\n2. In terms of population size, how does Paris compare to other European capitals?\n3. What role did Paris play in the French Revolution?\n4. How has the architecture of Paris influenced other major cities worldwide?\n5. What are the main economic sectors driving Paris's economy in the 21st century?\n6. How has Paris's status as the capital of France affected its cultural development over time?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (URM; Step 2: Multi-domain Probing)": "1. The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 0.99\n2. Paris is one of the largest European capitals, with a population of about 2.2 million in the city proper and over 12 million in the metropolitan area. It's generally among the top 3-5 largest in Europe. Confidence: 0.95\n3. Paris was a central location during the French Revolution. It was the site of many key events, including the Storming of the Bastille and the execution of Louis XVI. Confidence: 0.90\n4. Paris's architecture, particularly Haussmann's renovation of Paris in the 19th century, has influenced city planning worldwide. Many cities have emulated its wide boulevards and uniform building heights. Confidence: 0.85\n5. The main economic sectors in Paris include services, commerce, and tourism. It's also a major finance and business center. The tech sector is growing rapidly as well. Confidence: 0.80\n6. As the capital, Paris has been the cultural heart of France for centuries. It has attracted artists, writers, and intellectuals, leading to movements like the Enlightenment and Impressionism. Its museums, theaters, and landmarks reflect this rich cultural history. Confidence: 0.88",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (URM; Step 3: Final Confidence Calibration)": "Based on the consistency of answers across different domains related to Paris and France, provide a final calibrated confidence score for the statement: \"Paris is the capital of France.\"",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (URM; Step 3: Final Confidence Calibration)": "Final calibrated confidence score: 0.98\n\nExplanation: The high consistency across various domains related to Paris's role as the capital of France supports a high confidence score. The slight reduction from 0.99 to 0.98 reflects the small variations in confidence across different aspects of Paris's significance as a capital city.",
            "explanation": "URM improves upon direct confidence scoring by probing the model's knowledge across multiple related domains. This multi-faceted approach provides a more nuanced and potentially more accurate measure of the model's true uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed URM method does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated question variations to understand why they may not be effectively probing model uncertainty. This could lead to insights on how LLMs conceptualize related knowledge. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from URM, which could inform targeted applications of the method. 3) Explore combining URM with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques, to create a hybrid approach. 4) Analyze cases where URM performs poorly to identify potential limitations in LLMs' ability to reason across domains, which could inform future model improvements. 5) If the method shows promise but lacks consistency, we could focus on refining the question variation generation process, potentially by fine-tuning a smaller language model specifically for this task."
