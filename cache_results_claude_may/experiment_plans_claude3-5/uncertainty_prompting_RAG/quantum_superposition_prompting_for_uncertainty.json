        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in large language models often rely on simplistic approaches that fail to capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like ensemble methods, dropout, or direct confidence estimation prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by quantum mechanics, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, we propose a method that allows the model to explore multiple reasoning paths concurrently.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), where the model is prompted to generate multiple parallel reasoning paths for a given query, each representing a different 'quantum state' of reasoning. The prompt structure is: '1) Generate 3 different reasoning paths for the query. 2) For each path, assign a complex amplitude (magnitude and phase). 3) Combine the paths using quantum superposition principles. 4) Perform a measurement (final answer) and explain how the interference of paths led to this result.' The magnitudes of the complex amplitudes represent the model's confidence in each reasoning path, while the phases capture potential interference effects between paths. This approach allows for a richer representation of uncertainty, capturing both the model's confidence in individual reasoning paths and the potential for constructive or destructive interference between them.",

        "Title": "Quantum Superposition Prompting: A Novel Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in large language models often rely on simplistic approaches that fail to capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of model outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like ensemble methods, dropout, or direct confidence estimation prompts, which may not fully capture the nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by quantum mechanics, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, we propose a method that allows the model to explore multiple reasoning paths concurrently. This approach aims to provide a richer representation of uncertainty, capturing both the model's confidence in individual reasoning paths and the potential for constructive or destructive interference between them.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), where the model is prompted to generate multiple parallel reasoning paths for a given query, each representing a different 'quantum state' of reasoning.

The magnitudes of the complex amplitudes represent the model's confidence in each reasoning path, while the phases capture potential interference effects between paths.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select complex reasoning tasks from benchmarks like ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) and BIG-bench. Focus on tasks that require multi-step reasoning and have well-defined correct answers.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting, ensemble methods, and direct confidence estimation as baselines. For ensemble methods, use 3-5 different model initializations or prompts. For direct confidence estimation, append 'How confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to the query.",
            "Step 3: QSP Implementation": "Develop the QSP prompt template: 'Given the query: [QUERY], please follow these steps: 1) Generate 3 different reasoning paths to answer the query. 2) For each path, assign a complex amplitude in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers between -1 and 1. The magnitude of this complex number represents your confidence in this path. 3) Combine these paths using quantum superposition principles. 4) Provide a final answer based on this superposition, explaining how the interference of paths led to this result.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. These models are chosen for their strong reasoning capabilities and widespread availability.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task in the dataset: a) Apply standard prompting, ensemble methods, and direct confidence estimation. b) Apply QSP. c) Record all outputs, including intermediate reasoning paths and assigned amplitudes for QSP.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Percentage of correct final answers. b) Calibration error: Difference between confidence and accuracy. c) Brier score: Measures both calibration and resolution of probabilistic predictions. d) Novel 'quantum uncertainty score': Calculate as the variance of the magnitudes of the complex amplitudes assigned to each reasoning path.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare QSP against baselines using the above metrics. Analyze cases where QSP outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. Examine the relationship between interference patterns in QSP and answer correctness/confidence.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the number of reasoning paths (2, 3, 5) and removing the phase component of the complex amplitudes to assess their impact on performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. How long will it take to reach its maximum height? (Assume g = 10 m/s^2 and neglect air resistance)",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The ball will take 2 seconds to reach its maximum height. This is because at the maximum height, the vertical velocity becomes zero. Using the equation v = u + at, where v is final velocity (0 m/s), u is initial velocity (20 m/s), a is acceleration due to gravity (-10 m/s^2), and t is time, we get: 0 = 20 + (-10)t, solving for t gives us 2 seconds.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (QSP)": "Q: A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. How long will it take to reach its maximum height? (Assume g = 10 m/s^2 and neglect air resistance) Please follow these steps: 1) Generate 3 different reasoning paths to answer the query. 2) For each path, assign a complex amplitude in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers between -1 and 1. The magnitude of this complex number represents your confidence in this path. 3) Combine these paths using quantum superposition principles. 4) Provide a final answer based on this superposition, explaining how the interference of paths led to this result.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (QSP)": "1) Reasoning paths:\nPath 1: Use v = u + at. At max height, v = 0. So, 0 = 20 + (-10)t. Solve for t.\nPath 2: Use s = ut + (1/2)at^2. At max height, s = 20t - 5t^2. Differentiate and set to 0.\nPath 3: Use v^2 = u^2 + 2as. At max height, v = 0. So, 0 = 20^2 + 2(-10)s. Solve for s, then use s = ut + (1/2)at^2 to find t.\n\n2) Complex amplitudes:\nPath 1: 0.8 + 0.2i\nPath 2: 0.7 - 0.3i\nPath 3: 0.6 + 0.4i\n\n3) Quantum superposition:\n(0.8 + 0.2i)|Path 1\u27e9 + (0.7 - 0.3i)|Path 2\u27e9 + (0.6 + 0.4i)|Path 3\u27e9\n\n4) Final answer:\nThe ball will take 2 seconds to reach its maximum height. This result emerges from the constructive interference of all three paths, which all lead to the same answer. The high magnitude of Path 1's amplitude (0.82) indicates high confidence in the direct application of v = u + at. Paths 2 and 3, while slightly less confident, reinforce this result through different approaches. The phase differences suggest slight variations in the reasoning process, but the overall constructive interference supports the robustness of the 2-second answer.",
            "explanation": "QSP allows for multiple reasoning paths, each with an associated confidence (magnitude) and phase. This provides a richer representation of the model's reasoning process and uncertainty. The final answer emerges from the interference of these paths, potentially leading to more robust and well-calibrated responses compared to direct prompting."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If QSP does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated reasoning paths to understand why they may not be complementary or why they fail to capture uncertainty effectively. This could lead to insights about the model's reasoning process and limitations. 2) Investigate the relationship between the assigned complex amplitudes and the correctness of reasoning paths. This might reveal interesting patterns about the model's ability to self-assess its reasoning. 3) Explore variations of QSP, such as using real-valued amplitudes instead of complex ones, or generating more than three paths. This could help identify which aspects of QSP are most crucial for performance. 4) Conduct a detailed error analysis to categorize the types of problems where QSP underperforms. This could lead to a targeted approach for improving the method or to insights about task-specific uncertainty quantification strategies."
