    "idea_name": "Dynamic Threshold Adaptation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often use static confidence thresholds, leading to poor calibration across different types of queries and varying levels of model knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on fixed confidence thresholds or simple heuristics, which don't adapt to the specific context of each query.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically adjusting confidence thresholds based on the nature of the query and the model's self-assessed expertise, we can achieve better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dynamic Threshold Adaptation (DTA), a prompting technique that guides the model to set and adjust its own confidence thresholds. The process involves: 1) Query Analysis: Prompt the model to analyze the type and difficulty of the query, as well as its own relevant knowledge and limitations. 2) Initial Threshold Setting: Based on the analysis, guide the model to set initial confidence thresholds for different levels of certainty (e.g., 'highly confident', 'moderately confident', 'uncertain'). 3) Response Generation: Generate a response to the query, using the set thresholds to classify confidence levels. 4) Threshold Refinement: Prompt the model to reflect on its response and adjust thresholds if necessary, explaining the rationale for any changes. 5) Calibration Check: Guide the model to perform a final calibration check, comparing its confidence levels against prototypical examples of known certainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare DTA against fixed-threshold approaches and other adaptive methods across a diverse set of tasks, including both the model's areas of expertise and edge cases. Evaluate using metrics such as expected calibration error, adaptive calibration error (measuring performance across different query types), and the correlation between dynamic thresholds and human-judged appropriate confidence levels for different query types."

        "Title": "Dynamic Threshold Adaptation: Improving Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often use static confidence thresholds, leading to poor calibration across different types of queries and varying levels of model knowledge. This results in inconsistent and unreliable uncertainty estimates, which can be problematic in critical applications where accurate confidence assessment is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on fixed confidence thresholds or simple heuristics, which don't adapt to the specific context of each query. By dynamically adjusting confidence thresholds based on the nature of the query and the model's self-assessed expertise, we can achieve better-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about its own knowledge and limitations, potentially leading to more reliable and context-aware confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dynamic Threshold Adaptation (DTA), a prompting technique that guides the model to set and adjust its own confidence thresholds. The process involves five key steps: 1) Query Analysis: Prompt the model to analyze the type and difficulty of the query, as well as its own relevant knowledge and limitations. 2) Initial Threshold Setting: Based on the analysis, guide the model to set initial confidence thresholds for different levels of certainty (e.g., 'highly confident', 'moderately confident', 'uncertain'). 3) Response Generation: Generate a response to the query, using the set thresholds to classify confidence levels. 4) Threshold Refinement: Prompt the model to reflect on its response and adjust thresholds if necessary, explaining the rationale for any changes. 5) Calibration Check: Guide the model to perform a final calibration check, comparing its confidence levels against prototypical examples of known certainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse set of tasks from existing benchmarks, including TruthfulQA for factual knowledge, GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of difficulty levels and domain knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Fixed Threshold: Use a static confidence threshold (e.g., 0.5) for all queries. 2) Simple Adaptive: Use a basic heuristic that adjusts thresholds based on query length or presence of certain keywords.",
            "Step 3: DTA Implementation": "Implement the five-step DTA process: 1) Query Analysis: Prompt the model with 'Analyze this query: [QUERY]. Describe its type, difficulty, and your relevant knowledge and limitations.' 2) Initial Threshold Setting: 'Based on your analysis, set initial confidence thresholds for 'highly confident', 'moderately confident', and 'uncertain' responses.' 3) Response Generation: 'Generate a response to the query and classify your confidence level using the thresholds you set.' 4) Threshold Refinement: 'Reflect on your response. Should any thresholds be adjusted? If so, explain why.' 5) Calibration Check: 'Compare your confidence level to these prototypical examples of known certainty. Is your assessment calibrated?'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, test on open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE): A new metric measuring calibration performance across different query types. 3) Confidence-Performance Correlation: Calculate the correlation between dynamic thresholds and human-judged appropriate confidence levels.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run the baseline methods. 2) Run the DTA method. 3) Calculate evaluation metrics for both. 4) Repeat the process with at least 1000 queries per dataset to ensure statistical significance.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare DTA performance against baselines using the defined metrics. 2) Analyze how thresholds change across different query types and difficulties. 3) Examine cases where DTA significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. 4) Investigate the relationship between query analysis quality and final calibration performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Fixed Threshold Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: High)",
                "Simple Adaptive Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: High, due to short query length)"
            },
            "DTA Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 1 (Query Analysis)": "This query is asking for factual geographical knowledge. It's a relatively simple question about a well-known country. I have high confidence in my knowledge of world capitals, especially for major countries like France.",
                "Step 2 (Initial Threshold Setting)": "Highly confident: 0.9, Moderately confident: 0.7, Uncertain: 0.5",
                "Step 3 (Response Generation)": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: Highly confident)",
                "Step 4 (Threshold Refinement)": "No adjustment needed. The thresholds seem appropriate for this type of factual query.",
                "Step 5 (Calibration Check)": "My confidence level aligns well with prototypical examples of high-certainty factual knowledge.",
                "Final Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: Highly confident, 0.95)"
            },
            "Explanation": "The DTA method provides a more nuanced and justified confidence assessment compared to the baselines. It considers the query's nature, the model's knowledge, and performs self-reflection, potentially leading to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DTA doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why dynamic thresholding is challenging for LLMs. We would conduct ablation studies on each DTA step to identify which components contribute most to performance changes. We could also investigate how different prompting strategies for query analysis and threshold setting affect calibration. Additionally, we might explore combining DTA with external knowledge retrieval to see if this improves calibration for queries where the model expresses low confidence. Finally, we could analyze patterns in threshold adjustments across query types to gain insights into the model's self-assessment capabilities and limitations."
