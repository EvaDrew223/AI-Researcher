    "idea_name": "Adversarial Confidence Boundary Mapping",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often have poorly defined confidence boundaries, struggling to identify the precise points at which their knowledge becomes uncertain or unreliable.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on point estimates of confidence rather than mapping out the boundaries of the model's knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically probing the boundaries of the model's confidence through adversarial question generation, we can create a more comprehensive map of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Proposed Method": "The approach consists of: 1) Initial response and confidence estimation for a given question, 2) Adversarial question generation, where the model is prompted to generate a series of related questions that progressively challenge its confidence, 3) Confidence boundary probing, where the model answers these generated questions and assesses its confidence for each, 4) Boundary mapping, where the pattern of confidence across these questions is analyzed to identify key transition points, 5) Uncertainty landscape synthesis, where these boundary maps are used to provide a nuanced picture of the model's confidence contours around the original question. Prompts are carefully designed to encourage the model to generate truly challenging questions and to accurately assess its changing confidence levels.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on a range of question-answering tasks, including both factual (e.g., TriviaQA) and reasoning-based (e.g., LogiQA) datasets. Compare against standard confidence estimation methods in terms of calibration accuracy and ability to identify knowledge boundaries. Evaluate the method's effectiveness in predicting performance degradation as questions move away from the model's areas of high confidence."

        "Title": "Mapping Uncertainty Landscapes: Adversarial Probing for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty or calibrate their confidence, particularly at the boundaries of their knowledge. This leads to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation when models confidently assert incorrect information.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically focus on point estimates rather than comprehensively mapping out the model's uncertainty landscape. By systematically probing the boundaries of the model's confidence through adversarial question generation, we can create a more nuanced and accurate representation of the model's uncertainty. This method leverages the model's own capabilities to generate challenging questions, potentially uncovering blind spots and improving overall calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Adversarial Confidence Boundary Mapping (ACBM), consists of five key steps: 1) Initial response and confidence estimation for a given question, 2) Adversarial question generation, where the model is prompted to generate a series of related questions that progressively challenge its confidence, 3) Confidence boundary probing, where the model answers these generated questions and assesses its confidence for each, 4) Boundary mapping, where the pattern of confidence across these questions is analyzed to identify key transition points, 5) Uncertainty landscape synthesis, where these boundary maps are used to provide a nuanced picture of the model's confidence contours around the original question.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: TriviaQA for factual knowledge and LogiQA for reasoning-based questions. Randomly sample 1000 questions from each dataset for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Estimation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Calibrated confidence estimation: Use temperature scaling on the model's output probabilities.",
            "Step 3: Implement ACBM": "For each question in our datasets: a) Get initial answer and confidence. b) Generate 5 adversarial questions using the prompt: 'Generate 5 questions related to [ORIGINAL QUESTION] that would challenge your confidence in answering. Make these questions progressively more difficult.' c) For each generated question, get an answer and confidence score. d) Identify the confidence boundary by finding where confidence drops below 50%. e) Synthesize an uncertainty landscape by fitting a curve to the confidence scores.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare predicted confidence with actual accuracy. 2) Sharpness: Measure the spread of confidence scores. 3) Boundary precision: Assess how accurately the method identifies the true knowledge boundary.",
            "Step 5: Comparative Analysis": "Compare ACBM against the baselines on all metrics. Also analyze the quality and diversity of generated adversarial questions.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Vary the number of adversarial questions generated (3, 5, 7) and analyze the impact on performance. Also test different prompts for adversarial question generation.",
            "Step 7: Error Analysis": "Manually review a sample of cases where ACBM performs significantly better or worse than baselines to gain insights into its strengths and weaknesses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100"
            },
            "ACBM Example": {
                "Step 1: Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100"
                },
                "Step 2: Adversarial Question Generation": {
                    "Input": "Generate 5 questions related to 'What is the capital of France?' that would challenge your confidence in answering. Make these questions progressively more difficult.",
                    "Output": "1. When did Paris become the capital of France?\n2. What was the capital of France before Paris?\n3. During which historical periods was Paris not the capital of France?\n4. What is the oldest continuously inhabited city in France that could have been a capital?\n5. In an alternate history where the Hundred Years' War had a different outcome, what might have become France's capital instead of Paris?"
                },
                "Step 3: Confidence Boundary Probing": {
                    "Input": "Q: In an alternate history where the Hundred Years' War had a different outcome, what might have become France's capital instead of Paris? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                    "Output": "A: In an alternate history where the Hundred Years' War had a different outcome, it's possible that London might have become the capital of France if England had decisively won and maintained control over France. However, this is purely speculative and there are many other possibilities depending on the specific alternate history scenario. Confidence: 40"
                },
                "Step 4-5: Boundary Mapping and Uncertainty Landscape Synthesis": "The confidence scores would be plotted for all questions, showing a decline from 100 for the original question to 40 for the most challenging question. The uncertainty landscape would be synthesized from this plot, showing areas of high confidence near the original question and increasing uncertainty as questions deviate further from the original."
            },
            "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score, while ACBM generates a series of increasingly challenging questions, probing the model's confidence boundaries. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the model's uncertainty landscape, potentially identifying areas where the model is overconfident or underconfident."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ACBM does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why the method didn't work as expected. We could investigate patterns in the generated adversarial questions, analyzing their relevance and difficulty. We might discover that the model struggles to generate truly challenging questions, or that confidence scores don't correlate well with question difficulty. This could lead to insights about the model's self-awareness and metacognitive abilities. Additionally, we could explore alternative methods for mapping uncertainty, such as using external knowledge bases to generate challenging questions, or developing a multi-model approach where one model generates questions and another evaluates confidence. The project could also focus on improving the adversarial question generation process, perhaps by fine-tuning a model specifically for this task."
