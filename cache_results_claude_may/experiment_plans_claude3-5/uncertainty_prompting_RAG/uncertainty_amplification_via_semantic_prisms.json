    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly in complex or ambiguous scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence scoring or ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the way light is refracted through a prism, we can decompose complex queries into simpler sub-queries to better assess model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce 'Semantic Prisms' - a novel prompting technique that decomposes a given query into multiple semantically diverse sub-queries. Each sub-query represents a different 'wavelength' of the original question. The model answers these sub-queries independently, and we analyze the consistency and divergence of these answers to quantify uncertainty. The prompt includes instructions for the model to generate these sub-queries, answer them, and then synthesize the results. For example, for the question 'Will AI surpass human intelligence by 2050?', sub-queries might include 'What are current AI capabilities?', 'What is the rate of AI progress?', and 'What defines human-level intelligence?'. The divergence in answers to these sub-queries provides a measure of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare this method against standard confidence scoring and ensemble methods on a range of complex, open-ended questions. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error and Brier score."

        "Title": "Semantic Prisms: Decomposing Complex Queries to Quantify Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly in complex or ambiguous scenarios. This issue is especially pronounced when dealing with open-ended questions or tasks that require nuanced understanding and reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence scoring or ensemble methods, which may not capture the full complexity of the model's understanding. Inspired by the way light is refracted through a prism, we propose to decompose complex queries into simpler sub-queries to better assess model uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's ability to understand and generate diverse perspectives on a given topic, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce 'Semantic Prisms' - a novel prompting technique that decomposes a given query into multiple semantically diverse sub-queries.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of complex, open-ended questions from existing datasets such as ARC, TruthfulQA, and AI2 Reasoning Challenge. Ensure the questions cover various domains and levels of ambiguity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence scoring: prompt the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. (2) Ensemble method: use multiple model instances or different prompts to generate multiple answers and calculate uncertainty based on their agreement.",
            "Step 3: Semantic Prism Implementation": "Develop the Semantic Prism prompting technique: (a) Create a prompt template that instructs the model to generate sub-queries. (b) Implement a function to send these sub-queries to the model and collect answers. (c) Design a method to synthesize sub-query answers and quantify uncertainty based on their consistency and divergence.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: (a) Apply both baseline methods and record their uncertainty estimates. (b) Apply the Semantic Prism method, recording generated sub-queries, their answers, and the final synthesized answer with uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using metrics such as calibration error and Brier score. For a subset of questions, conduct a human evaluation to assess the quality and relevance of generated sub-queries and the reasonableness of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of Semantic Prisms against the baselines. Analyze patterns in sub-query generation and how they relate to final uncertainty estimates. Investigate cases where Semantic Prisms significantly outperform or underperform compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Will AI surpass human intelligence by 2050?",
                "Direct Confidence Scoring Output": "A: It is difficult to predict with certainty whether AI will surpass human intelligence by 2050. While AI has made significant advancements in recent years, achieving human-level intelligence across all domains remains a complex challenge. Some experts believe it's possible, while others are more skeptical. Confidence score: 60%",
                "Ensemble Method Output": "Responses from 3 model instances: (1) Yes, likely by 2045. (2) Uncertain, possibly by 2060-2070. (3) No, not by 2050 but maybe later. Uncertainty estimate: High (significant disagreement)"
            },
            "Semantic Prism Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Will AI surpass human intelligence by 2050?",
                "Sub-queries": [
                    "1. What are the current capabilities of AI compared to human intelligence?",
                    "2. What is the projected rate of AI progress over the next few decades?",
                    "3. How do we define and measure human-level intelligence?",
                    "4. What are the main challenges in achieving human-level AI?",
                    "5. What do leading AI researchers predict about the timeline for human-level AI?"
                ],
                "Sub-query Answers": [
                    "1. Current AI excels in specific tasks like image recognition and game-playing but lacks general intelligence and common sense reasoning of humans.",
                    "2. AI progress has been rapid, with significant breakthroughs every few years, but the rate of future progress is uncertain and debated.",
                    "3. Human-level intelligence involves general problem-solving, creativity, emotional intelligence, and adaptability across diverse domains - a complex benchmark to define precisely.",
                    "4. Main challenges include developing common sense reasoning, emotional intelligence, and integrating diverse cognitive abilities into a unified system.",
                    "5. Predictions vary widely: some researchers estimate 2040-2060, others believe it will take much longer, and some doubt it will happen this century."
                ],
                "Synthesized Answer": "Based on the sub-query responses, it's highly uncertain whether AI will surpass human intelligence by 2050. While AI has made rapid progress, achieving human-level intelligence involves overcoming significant challenges in areas like general reasoning and emotional intelligence. The diversity of expert opinions and the complexity of defining human-level intelligence contribute to this uncertainty. A more precise estimate would require clearer benchmarks for human-level AI and more consensus on the rate of future progress.",
                "Uncertainty Estimate": "High uncertainty (85% uncertainty score). The divergence in expert opinions, the challenges in defining human-level intelligence, and the unpredictable rate of future progress all contribute to this high uncertainty."
            },
            "Explanation": "The Semantic Prism approach provides a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the question compared to the baselines. By breaking down the complex question into sub-queries, it explores various aspects that contribute to the uncertainty, such as current AI capabilities, progress rates, definition challenges, and expert opinions. This decomposition allows for a more detailed analysis of why the question is uncertain, potentially leading to a more accurate and justifiable uncertainty estimate compared to the simpler baseline methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the Semantic Prism method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of why decomposing queries doesn't improve uncertainty quantification as expected. This could involve examining the quality and diversity of generated sub-queries, analyzing how different types of questions benefit (or don't) from decomposition, and investigating whether the method works better for certain domains or question types. We could also explore variations of the method, such as using different strategies for sub-query generation or alternative ways of synthesizing sub-query answers. Additionally, we could conduct a more detailed error analysis to understand where and why the method fails, which could provide insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling complex reasoning tasks and inform future research directions in improving model uncertainty estimation."
