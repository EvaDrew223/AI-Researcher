        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often fail to capture the compounding effects of uncertainty in multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on end-to-end uncertainty estimation or use chain-of-thought prompting with confidence scores at each step.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from error propagation in scientific measurements, we propose a method to track how uncertainty accumulates and propagates through each step of a complex reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Propagation Trees (UPT), a prompting technique that guides the LLM to construct a tree-like structure of its reasoning process. At each node, the model not only provides an intermediate conclusion but also estimates its uncertainty and how it depends on previous steps. The prompts encourage the model to consider multiple paths, backtrack when uncertainty becomes too high, and explicitly model how uncertainties combine. The final output includes both the conclusion and a comprehensive uncertainty estimate that accounts for the entire reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UPT on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH, comparing it to standard chain-of-thought prompting and other uncertainty estimation methods. We'll assess both task performance and the quality of uncertainty estimates using metrics like expected calibration error and Brier score."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Propagation Trees: Tracking Compounding Uncertainty in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the compounding effects of uncertainty in multi-step reasoning tasks. This limitation can lead to overconfident or unreliable outputs in complex problem-solving scenarios, potentially resulting in incorrect decisions or misleading information.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on end-to-end uncertainty estimation or use chain-of-thought prompting with confidence scores at each step. However, these methods do not adequately account for how uncertainties accumulate and interact throughout a complex reasoning process. Drawing inspiration from error propagation in scientific measurements, we propose a method to track how uncertainty accumulates and propagates through each step of a complex reasoning process. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the model's uncertainty, leading to more reliable and interpretable outputs in multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Propagation Trees (UPT), a prompting technique that guides the LLM to construct a tree-like structure of its reasoning process. At each node, the model not only provides an intermediate conclusion but also estimates its uncertainty and how it depends on previous steps. The prompts encourage the model to consider multiple paths, backtrack when uncertainty becomes too high, and explicitly model how uncertainties combine. The final output includes both the conclusion and a comprehensive uncertainty estimate that accounts for the entire reasoning process. The UPT method consists of the following steps: 1) Initial problem decomposition, 2) Uncertainty estimation for each sub-step, 3) Propagation of uncertainty through the reasoning tree, 4) Backtracking and alternative path exploration when uncertainty exceeds a threshold, and 5) Final answer synthesis with comprehensive uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets provide a diverse range of multi-step reasoning problems suitable for evaluating our method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement and evaluate two baseline methods: a) Standard chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and b) CoT with simple confidence scoring at each step. Use GPT-4 as the base model for all experiments.",
            "Step 3: UPT Prompt Design": "Design a set of prompts that guide the model to construct Uncertainty Propagation Trees. The prompts should include instructions for: a) Breaking down the problem into sub-steps, b) Estimating uncertainty for each step, c) Propagating uncertainty through the tree, d) Exploring alternative paths when uncertainty is high, and e) Synthesizing the final answer with uncertainty quantification.",
            "Step 4: UPT Implementation": "Implement the UPT method using the designed prompts. This will involve multiple API calls to GPT-4, each responsible for different aspects of the UPT process (e.g., problem decomposition, uncertainty estimation, path exploration).",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement evaluation metrics including: a) Task performance (accuracy on GSM8K and MATH datasets), b) Calibration metrics (Expected Calibration Error, Brier Score), c) Tree structure analysis (depth, breadth, number of backtracking instances), and d) Correlation between estimated uncertainty and correctness of answers.",
            "Step 6: Experiments": "Run experiments comparing UPT against the baselines on both datasets. Analyze the results using the defined metrics, paying special attention to how UPT performs on problems of varying complexity.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of UPT. This includes: a) Removing the backtracking mechanism, b) Using fixed uncertainty thresholds vs. adaptive thresholds, and c) Varying the depth of the uncertainty propagation tree.",
            "Step 8: Error Analysis": "Perform a detailed error analysis on a subset of problems where UPT performs significantly better or worse than baselines. This will help identify the strengths and limitations of the method.",
            "Step 9: Generalization Test": "Test the generalization of UPT on a different task, such as multi-hop question answering using the HotpotQA dataset, to assess its applicability beyond mathematical reasoning."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard CoT)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more, then gives 2 to his friend. How many apples does John have now? Let's approach this step by step.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard CoT)": "1. Initial number of apples: 5\n2. Apples bought: 3\n3. Total after buying: 5 + 3 = 8 apples\n4. Apples given to friend: 2\n5. Final number of apples: 8 - 2 = 6 apples\nTherefore, John has 6 apples now.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPT)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more, then gives 2 to his friend. How many apples does John have now? Construct an Uncertainty Propagation Tree to solve this problem. For each step, provide an uncertainty estimate (low/medium/high) and explain how it depends on previous steps. Explore alternative paths if uncertainty becomes high.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPT)": "Uncertainty Propagation Tree:\n1. Initial state (Uncertainty: Low)\n   - John has 5 apples\n   - Confidence: High (given in the problem)\n\n2. Buying apples (Uncertainty: Low)\n   - John buys 3 more apples\n   - New total: 5 + 3 = 8 apples\n   - Confidence: High (simple addition, low chance of error)\n\n3. Giving apples (Uncertainty: Low)\n   - John gives 2 apples to his friend\n   - Remaining apples: 8 - 2 = 6 apples\n   - Confidence: High (simple subtraction, low chance of error)\n\nFinal Answer: John has 6 apples now.\nOverall Uncertainty: Low\nExplanation: Each step in this problem involves simple arithmetic with small numbers, leading to low uncertainty at each stage. The uncertainties do not compound significantly as the operations are straightforward and independent.",
            "explanation": "The UPT method provides a structured approach to solving the problem while explicitly considering uncertainty at each step. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of the confidence in the final answer, which in this case is high due to the simplicity of the problem. In more complex problems, the UPT method would show its strength by highlighting steps with higher uncertainty and exploring alternative paths when needed."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UPT method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of the generated uncertainty estimates to understand why they might not be improving performance. This could lead to insights about how LLMs reason about uncertainty. 2) Investigate whether UPT performs better on a subset of problems with specific characteristics (e.g., problems requiring longer reasoning chains or problems with inherent ambiguity). This could help identify niches where the method is most effective. 3) Explore how the UPT method affects the interpretability of the model's reasoning process, even if it doesn't improve raw performance. This could turn the project into a study on improving the transparency and explainability of LLM reasoning. 4) Investigate whether the UPT method, while not improving average performance, leads to better worst-case performance by identifying highly uncertain situations. This could position the work as a method for improving the reliability of LLMs in critical applications."
