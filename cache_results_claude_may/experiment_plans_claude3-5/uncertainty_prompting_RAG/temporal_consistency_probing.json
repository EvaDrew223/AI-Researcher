    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often fail to capture inconsistencies in model outputs over time or across different contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-instance uncertainty estimation, neglecting temporal or contextual variations in model confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often assess their certainty by considering how consistent their judgments remain over time or across slightly different scenarios. We can adapt this principle to create a more robust uncertainty quantification method for LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing (TCP). This method involves prompting the LLM with the same or slightly modified versions of a question across simulated time intervals or varying contexts. TCP uses carefully crafted prompts that suggest the passage of time or subtle changes in circumstances, asking the model to reconsider its answer and confidence level. The method then analyzes the consistency of the model's responses and confidence scores across these variations. High variability in answers or confidence levels indicates greater uncertainty. TCP can also prompt the model to explain any changes in its responses, providing insight into the factors influencing its uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TCP against standard uncertainty estimation methods on tasks like fact-checking, prediction tasks, and opinion-based questions. Assess the method's ability to identify truly uncertain responses versus confidently held beliefs. Compare TCP results with human judgments on the stability and certainty of various types of knowledge over time and across contexts."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Probing: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture inconsistencies in model outputs over time or across different contexts, leading to unreliable confidence assessments.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-instance uncertainty estimation, neglecting temporal or contextual variations in model confidence. Human experts often assess their certainty by considering how consistent their judgments remain over time or across slightly different scenarios. By adapting this principle, we can create a more robust uncertainty quantification method for LLMs that better reflects the model's true confidence and reliability across varying contexts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing (TCP), a novel method for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. TCP involves prompting the LLM with the same or slightly modified versions of a question across simulated time intervals or varying contexts. The method uses carefully crafted prompts that suggest the passage of time or subtle changes in circumstances, asking the model to reconsider its answer and confidence level. TCP then analyzes the consistency of the model's responses and confidence scores across these variations. High variability in answers or confidence levels indicates greater uncertainty. Additionally, TCP prompts the model to explain any changes in its responses, providing insight into the factors influencing its uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for our experiments: (1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking, (2) ForecastQA for prediction tasks, and (3) EthicsQA for opinion-based questions. These datasets cover a range of question types that can benefit from temporal consistency analysis.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: (1) Softmax probabilities: Use the softmax output of the model as a measure of confidence. (2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and use the variance of multiple forward passes as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: TCP Implementation": "Implement the TCP method with the following sub-steps: (a) Generate temporal variations of each question in the datasets. For example, for a question \"Who is the current president of the United States?\", create variations like \"Who was the president of the United States last year?\" and \"Who will likely be the president of the United States next year?\". (b) Create a prompt template that includes the original question, its temporal variations, and instructions for the model to provide answers, confidence scores, and explanations for any changes in responses. (c) Query the LLM with this prompt and collect the responses, confidence scores, and explanations.",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Quantification": "For TCP, calculate uncertainty scores based on the consistency of responses and confidence scores across temporal variations. For example, use the standard deviation of confidence scores or a measure of semantic similarity between responses.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare TCP against the baseline methods using the following metrics: (1) Calibration error: Measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. (2) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on uncertainty scores. (3) Spearman correlation: Calculate the correlation between human-judged uncertainty and model-estimated uncertainty.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to compare TCP results with human judgments on the stability and certainty of various types of knowledge over time and across contexts. Use a 5-point Likert scale for humans to rate the uncertainty of model responses.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform an in-depth analysis of the results, focusing on: (1) Performance comparison between TCP and baseline methods across different question types. (2) Qualitative analysis of model explanations for changes in responses. (3) Correlation between response consistency and human-judged uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who is the current president of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The current president of France is Emmanuel Macron. Confidence level: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Answer the following questions about the president of France, considering different time frames. For each question, provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0 to 100. Also, explain any changes in your responses or confidence levels.\n\nQ1: Who is the current president of France?\nQ2: Who was the president of France one year ago?\nQ3: Who do you think will be the president of France one year from now?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Q1: The current president of France is Emmanuel Macron. Confidence level: 95\nExplanation: I'm highly confident in this answer as Emmanuel Macron was elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2022 for a five-year term.\n\nQ2: The president of France one year ago was also Emmanuel Macron. Confidence level: 98\nExplanation: I'm even more confident in this answer because it's a historical fact that Macron has been president since 2017.\n\nQ3: It's likely that Emmanuel Macron will still be the president of France one year from now. Confidence level: 80\nExplanation: My confidence is lower for this prediction because while Macron's term lasts until 2027, unforeseen political events could potentially change this. The future is inherently less certain than the present or past.",
            "Explanation": "The TCP method provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty across different temporal contexts. It reveals higher confidence for past events, stable confidence for the present, and lower confidence for future predictions. This temporal consistency information is not captured by the baseline method, which only provides a single confidence score without considering different time frames."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCP doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the types of questions where TCP performs well or poorly, which could provide insights into the strengths and limitations of the method. (2) Explore variations of TCP, such as using different time scales or incorporating spatial consistency alongside temporal consistency. (3) Investigate the relationship between the model's explanations for changes in responses and its uncertainty estimates, which could lead to a new explainable AI approach for uncertainty quantification. (4) Combine TCP with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods."
