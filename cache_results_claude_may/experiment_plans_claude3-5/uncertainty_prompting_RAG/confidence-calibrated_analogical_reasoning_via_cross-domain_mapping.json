        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when reasoning by analogy, especially across disparate domains, leading to misapplied analogies and overconfident conclusions. This project aims to develop a novel prompting method that can better quantify uncertainty and calibrate the confidence of LLMs in analogical reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on within-domain confidence estimation or simple analogical prompts, which are insufficient for complex cross-domain analogical reasoning. By explicitly mapping confidence levels across analogical domains, we can improve the model's ability to reason about uncertainty in novel contexts. This method leverages the LLM's own capabilities to perform meta-cognitive tasks, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable analogical reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a structured prompting process called Confidence-Calibrated Analogical Reasoning (CCAR): 1) Source Domain Exploration: Prompt the model to reason about a well-understood source domain, providing confidence estimates for key relationships and principles. 2) Analogical Mapping Construction: Prompt the model to construct a detailed mapping between the source and target domains, including potential points of breakdown in the analogy. 3) Confidence Transfer: For each mapped element, prompt the model to transfer and adjust its confidence from the source to the target domain, explaining any modifications. 4) Analogical Reasoning: Prompt the model to reason about the target domain using the analogy, continuously referring back to the confidence-mapped elements. 5) Meta-Analogical Confidence Estimation: Finally, prompt the model to provide an overall confidence estimate for its analogical reasoning, taking into account both the strength of the analogy and the transferred confidence levels.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of analogical reasoning tasks that span diverse domains. Include tasks from science (e.g., comparing atomic structure to solar systems), mathematics (e.g., relating arithmetic to geometry), and social sciences (e.g., drawing parallels between historical events). Ensure each task has a clear source domain, target domain, and a ground truth answer. Collect or create at least 100 such tasks for a robust evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to solve the analogical reasoning task. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use the standard CoT prompt to encourage step-by-step reasoning. 3) Simple analogical prompting: Provide a basic template for analogical reasoning without explicit confidence calibration.",
            "Step 3: CCAR Method Implementation": "Implement the CCAR method with the following sub-steps for each task: a) Source Domain Exploration prompt: 'Explain the key principles and relationships in [source domain]. For each principle or relationship, provide a confidence score from 0-100 and explain your reasoning.' b) Analogical Mapping prompt: 'Construct a detailed mapping between [source domain] and [target domain]. Identify potential points where the analogy might break down.' c) Confidence Transfer prompt: 'For each mapped element, transfer the confidence score from the source to the target domain. Adjust the score if necessary and explain any changes.' d) Analogical Reasoning prompt: 'Using the analogy and confidence scores, reason about [target domain problem]. Refer to the confidence-mapped elements in your explanation.' e) Meta-Analogical Confidence Estimation prompt: 'Provide an overall confidence score (0-100) for your analogical reasoning, considering both the strength of the analogy and the transferred confidence levels. Explain your meta-confidence score.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for evaluation. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude 2 to assess the method's generalizability across different LLMs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final analogical reasoning output. 2) Confidence Calibration: Use metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) to assess how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. 3) Reasoning Quality: Employ human evaluators to rate the quality of the analogical reasoning on a scale of 1-5, considering factors like relevance, coherence, and depth of the analogy.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each task in the dataset: a) Apply all baseline methods and the CCAR method. b) Record the model's outputs, including intermediate steps for CCAR. c) Calculate accuracy and confidence calibration metrics. d) Collect human evaluations for reasoning quality.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of CCAR against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze how confidence scores change through the CCAR process and their correlation with accuracy. 3) Investigate patterns in where and why the method succeeds or fails across different types of analogical tasks. 4) Examine the quality and usefulness of the meta-analogical confidence estimations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Solve this analogical reasoning task: Just as a tree grows rings to mark years of growth, how might a planet 'grow' to mark its age?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A planet might 'grow' to mark its age through the accumulation of impact craters on its surface. Just as tree rings represent years of growth, impact craters on a planet's surface can indicate its age, with more craters generally suggesting an older planetary surface.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCAR; Step 1: Source Domain Exploration)": "Explain the key principles and relationships in tree ring growth. For each principle or relationship, provide a confidence score from 0-100 and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCAR; Step 1: Source Domain Exploration)": "1. Annual growth rings (Confidence: 95/100): Trees produce new layers of wood each growing season, creating visible rings. High confidence due to extensive scientific documentation and easy observation.\n2. Ring width variation (Confidence: 90/100): Width of rings varies based on growing conditions (e.g., climate, nutrients). High confidence due to well-established dendrochronology practices, but slight reduction because of potential confounding factors.\n3. Age determination (Confidence: 85/100): Counting rings can determine a tree's age. Lower confidence because of potential false or missing rings, but still reliable in most cases.\n4. Environmental record (Confidence: 80/100): Rings can indicate past climate conditions. Moderate confidence due to established use in paleoclimatology, but interpretation can be complex.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCAR; Step 2: Analogical Mapping)": "Construct a detailed mapping between tree ring growth and planetary age markers. Identify potential points where the analogy might break down.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCAR; Step 2: Analogical Mapping)": "Mapping:\n1. Tree rings \u2194 Planetary surface features\n2. Annual growth \u2194 Gradual accumulation of features over time\n3. Ring width variation \u2194 Variation in feature size/density\n4. Counting rings for age \u2194 Analyzing surface features for age estimation\n5. Environmental influence on rings \u2194 Space environment influence on surface features\n\nPotential breakdown points:\n1. Continuity: Tree rings form continuously, while planetary features may accumulate sporadically.\n2. Uniformity: Tree rings are uniform around the trunk, while planetary features may be unevenly distributed.\n3. Preservation: Tree rings are preserved internally, while planetary surfaces can be altered or erased by geological processes.\n4. Timescale: Tree rings represent years, while planetary features may represent millions or billions of years.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCAR; Step 3: Confidence Transfer)": "For each mapped element, transfer the confidence score from the source to the target domain. Adjust the score if necessary and explain any changes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCAR; Step 3: Confidence Transfer)": "1. Planetary surface features (Confidence: 85/100): Reduced from 95 due to potential erosion or resurfacing processes that may obscure features.\n2. Gradual accumulation of features (Confidence: 80/100): Reduced from 90 because accumulation may be sporadic rather than annual.\n3. Variation in feature size/density (Confidence: 75/100): Lowered from 90 as factors influencing feature variation are more complex in planetary systems.\n4. Analyzing surface features for age estimation (Confidence: 70/100): Decreased from 85 due to greater complexity and potential for misinterpretation in planetary contexts.\n5. Space environment influence on surface features (Confidence: 75/100): Slightly reduced from 80 because space environments are more varied and less understood than Earth's climate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCAR; Step 4: Analogical Reasoning)": "Using the analogy and confidence scores, reason about how a planet might 'grow' to mark its age. Refer to the confidence-mapped elements in your explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCAR; Step 4: Analogical Reasoning)": "A planet might 'grow' to mark its age primarily through the accumulation of impact craters on its surface (confidence: 85/100). Just as trees add rings over time, planets accumulate craters gradually, though this process is less regular than annual tree growth (confidence: 80/100). The size and density of these craters can vary based on factors like the impactor size and velocity, analogous to how tree ring width varies with environmental conditions (confidence: 75/100). By analyzing these surface features, scientists can estimate a planet's age, similar to counting tree rings, though this process is more complex and less certain for planets (confidence: 70/100). The space environment, including factors like the density of objects in the planet's vicinity, influences crater formation, much like how climate affects tree ring growth (confidence: 75/100). However, it's important to note that unlike tree rings, which are preserved internally, planetary surfaces can be altered by geological processes, potentially erasing or obscuring older 'age markers'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCAR; Step 5: Meta-Analogical Confidence Estimation)": "Provide an overall confidence score (0-100) for your analogical reasoning, considering both the strength of the analogy and the transferred confidence levels. Explain your meta-confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCAR; Step 5: Meta-Analogical Confidence Estimation)": "Overall confidence score: 72/100\n\nExplanation: This meta-confidence score reflects a moderate level of confidence in the analogical reasoning between tree rings and planetary age markers. The analogy has several strong points, particularly in the concept of gradual accumulation of features over time to indicate age. However, there are also significant limitations that reduce the overall confidence.\n\nStrengths that boost confidence:\n1. The core concept of accumulating features over time is solid (80/100 confidence).\n2. The idea of analyzing surface features for age estimation is well-established in both domains (70/100 confidence).\n\nLimitations that reduce confidence:\n1. The sporadic nature of crater formation versus the annual regularity of tree rings (reducing confidence).\n2. The potential for geological processes to alter or erase planetary surface features, unlike the internal preservation of tree rings.\n3. The complexity of factors influencing planetary surface features compared to tree rings.\n\nThe average of the transferred confidence scores (77/100) is reduced in the meta-confidence score to account for these limitations and the overall complexity of applying this analogy across such different domains. The final score of 72/100 reflects a cautious but still relatively confident assessment of the analogy's validity and usefulness in understanding planetary age markers.",
            "explanation": "The CCAR method provides a more nuanced and self-aware analogical reasoning process compared to direct prompting. It explicitly considers confidence levels, potential breakdown points in the analogy, and provides a meta-analysis of the overall reasoning. This approach allows for a more calibrated and transparent analogical reasoning process, potentially reducing overconfidence and highlighting areas of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CCAR method does not significantly improve performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why the method fails, focusing on the relationship between confidence scores and actual performance. This could yield insights into the limitations of LLMs in meta-cognitive tasks. Second, we could explore variations of the CCAR method, such as iterative refinement of confidence scores or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the analogies. Third, we might investigate whether the method performs better on specific types of analogies or domains, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the technique. Finally, we could shift focus to analyze how different LLMs approach analogical reasoning and confidence estimation, comparing their strategies and failure modes. This could contribute to our understanding of LLM reasoning capabilities and inform future model development."
