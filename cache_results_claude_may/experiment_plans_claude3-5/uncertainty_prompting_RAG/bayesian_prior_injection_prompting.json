This approach encourages the model to reason about uncertainty in a more statistically grounded manner.",

        "Title": "Bayesian Prior Injection Prompting: Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs into their uncertainty estimates, leading to poorly calibrated confidence in domain-specific tasks. This issue is particularly pronounced when LLMs are applied to specialized domains where expert knowledge is crucial for accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically rely on the model's pretrained knowledge without explicitly incorporating task-specific priors. This can lead to overconfidence or underconfidence in domains where the model's general knowledge is insufficient. By injecting Bayesian-inspired priors into the prompting process, we can guide the model towards more calibrated uncertainty estimates that reflect domain expertise. This approach leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities while constraining its outputs with structured prior knowledge, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates in specialized domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Bayesian Prior Injection Prompting (BPIP), a technique that explicitly incorporates prior beliefs into the uncertainty quantification process. The method involves five key steps: 1) Formulating domain-specific prior beliefs as probabilistic statements, 2) Injecting these priors into the prompt in a structured format (e.g., 'Given that P(X) = 0.7 and P(Y|X) = 0.8...'), 3) Guiding the model to reason about the problem using Bayesian-inspired language (e.g., 'Update your belief based on this new evidence...'), 4) Eliciting posterior probabilities or confidence estimates, and 5) Calibrating the final uncertainty based on the model's ability to correctly update beliefs. This approach encourages the model to reason about uncertainty in a more statistically grounded manner, potentially leading to better-calibrated outputs in domain-specific tasks.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) A subset of the MedQA dataset for medical diagnosis tasks, and 2) A curated set of scientific hypothesis testing scenarios from the ScienceQA dataset. For each dataset, we will create a test set of 100 questions, each accompanied by domain-expert-provided prior probabilities for key events or outcomes.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly asking the model to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: asking the model to show its reasoning before providing an answer and confidence estimate. 3) Calibrated prompting: using existing calibration techniques such as temperature scaling on the model's outputs.",
            "Step 3: BPIP Implementation": "Implement the BPIP method as follows: a) For each question, formulate the relevant prior probabilities as structured statements. b) Create a prompt template that incorporates these priors and guides the model through Bayesian reasoning. c) Implement a function to extract the model's posterior probabilities or confidence estimates from its output. d) Develop a calibration step that adjusts the final confidence based on the model's demonstrated ability to update beliefs correctly.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models provide state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and BPIP): a) Run the model on all test questions. b) Collect the model's answers, reasoning (if applicable), and confidence estimates. c) For BPIP, also collect the intermediate belief updates and reasoning steps.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration error: difference between confidence estimates and actual accuracy. 3) Brier score: to assess the quality of probabilistic predictions. 4) For BPIP, also evaluate the quality of intermediate belief updates using expert-provided ground truths.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis comparing BPIP with baseline methods: a) Compare overall performance metrics. b) Analyze cases where BPIP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. c) Assess the quality and interpretability of the Bayesian reasoning steps in BPIP outputs. d) Investigate how different prior formulations affect the final outcomes."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: A 45-year-old male presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and a history of smoking. What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide your answer and a confidence level from 0 to 100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The most likely diagnosis is Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Confidence level: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (BPIP)": "Given the following priors:\nP(ACS|45yo male, smoker) = 0.3\nP(chest pain|ACS) = 0.8\nP(shortness of breath|ACS) = 0.7\n\nQ: A 45-year-old male presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and a history of smoking. What is the most likely diagnosis? Update your belief based on this new evidence and provide your posterior probability for ACS.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (BPIP)": "Let's approach this step-by-step using Bayesian reasoning:\n\n1. Prior probability of ACS given age and smoking history: P(ACS) = 0.3\n\n2. Likelihood of symptoms given ACS:\nP(chest pain|ACS) = 0.8\nP(shortness of breath|ACS) = 0.7\n\n3. We need to calculate P(ACS|symptoms) using Bayes' theorem:\nP(ACS|symptoms) = P(symptoms|ACS) * P(ACS) / P(symptoms)\n\n4. Assuming independence of symptoms (simplification):\nP(symptoms|ACS) = P(chest pain|ACS) * P(shortness of breath|ACS) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56\n\n5. We don't know P(symptoms) directly, but we can estimate it using the law of total probability (simplified):\nP(symptoms) \u2248 P(symptoms|ACS) * P(ACS) + P(symptoms|not ACS) * P(not ACS)\n\u2248 0.56 * 0.3 + 0.1 * 0.7 = 0.238 (assuming P(symptoms|not ACS) = 0.1)\n\n6. Now we can calculate the posterior probability:\nP(ACS|symptoms) = 0.56 * 0.3 / 0.238 \u2248 0.71\n\nTherefore, the updated probability (posterior) of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) given the patient's symptoms and history is approximately 71%.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) with a posterior probability of 71%.",
            "explanation": "BPIP provides a structured way to incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs based on new evidence. This leads to a more transparent and potentially more accurate probability estimate compared to the baseline method, which may be prone to overconfidence or bias based on the model's pretraining."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If BPIP does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality of prior probabilities and how they affect the final estimates. This could lead to insights on how to better formulate priors for LLMs. 2) The model's ability to follow Bayesian reasoning steps. If the model struggles with this, we could explore simplified versions of BPIP or alternative ways to guide the model's reasoning. 3) How BPIP performs across different types of questions or domains. This could reveal in which scenarios BPIP is most effective, leading to a more nuanced understanding of when to apply this method. 4) The impact of different prompt formulations on the model's performance. This could provide insights into how to better design prompts for uncertainty quantification tasks. By focusing on these aspects, we could transform the project into an in-depth analysis of how LLMs handle probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty, which would still provide valuable insights for the field."
