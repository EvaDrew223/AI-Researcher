        "Problem": "LLMs often have poorly defined confidence boundaries, leading to overconfidence in areas just beyond their knowledge or capabilities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on in-distribution uncertainty quantification, missing the crucial edge cases where models transition from confidence to uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By actively probing and refining the boundaries of a model's confidence, we can obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates, especially for queries that fall in grey areas of the model's knowledge.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an iterative prompting strategy to explore confidence boundaries: (1) Start with a seed question where the model is confident, (2) Generate a series of variations that gradually increase in difficulty or move away from the model's knowledge base, (3) For each variation, prompt the model to assess its confidence and explain any changes, (4) Identify the variations where confidence drops significantly, (5) Zoom in on these boundary regions, generating finer-grained variations to precisely map the confidence transition, (6) Aggregate these boundary explorations to create a confidence boundary map. This approach allows for more nuanced uncertainty quantification, especially for queries that fall near the edges of the model's capabilities.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on a range of tasks, focusing on how well the method identifies and quantifies uncertainty for edge cases. Compare against standard uncertainty quantification baselines in terms of calibration and ability to identify out-of-distribution queries. Analyze how the mapped confidence boundaries align with actual performance drop-offs."

        "Title": "Mapping Confidence Boundaries: Iterative Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit poorly defined confidence boundaries, leading to overconfidence in areas just beyond their knowledge or capabilities. This overconfidence can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on in-distribution uncertainty, missing crucial edge cases where models transition from confidence to uncertainty. By actively probing and refining the boundaries of a model's confidence, we can obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates, especially for queries that fall in grey areas of the model's knowledge. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of model capabilities and limitations, potentially improving the safety and reliability of LLM applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an iterative prompting strategy to explore confidence boundaries: (1) Start with a seed question where the model is confident, (2) Generate a series of variations that gradually increase in difficulty or move away from the model's knowledge base, (3) For each variation, prompt the model to assess its confidence and explain any changes, (4) Identify the variations where confidence drops significantly, (5) Zoom in on these boundary regions, generating finer-grained variations to precisely map the confidence transition, (6) Aggregate these boundary explorations to create a confidence boundary map.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a diverse set of seed questions across multiple domains (e.g., science, history, current events, common knowledge). Ensure these questions are within the model's known capabilities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Assessment": "For each seed question, obtain the model's answer and confidence score using standard prompting techniques. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 3: Question Variation Generation": "For each seed question, prompt the model to generate 5-10 variations that gradually increase in difficulty or specificity. Example prompt: 'Generate 5 variations of the following question, gradually increasing in difficulty or specificity: [SEED_QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Confidence Probing": "For each question variation, prompt the model to answer the question, provide a confidence score (0-100), and explain its reasoning. Example prompt: 'Answer the following question, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100, and explain your reasoning: [QUESTION_VARIATION]'",
            "Step 5: Boundary Identification": "Analyze the confidence scores across variations to identify significant drops (e.g., >20 point decrease). These areas represent potential confidence boundaries.",
            "Step 6: Fine-grained Boundary Mapping": "For identified boundary regions, generate 5-10 more fine-grained variations between the last high-confidence question and the first low-confidence question. Repeat the confidence probing process for these new variations.",
            "Step 7: Confidence Boundary Mapping": "Aggregate the results to create a confidence boundary map for each seed question. This map should show how confidence changes as questions become more difficult or specific.",
            "Step 8: Comparison with Baselines": "Compare the performance of our method against two baselines: (1) Standard prompting with confidence scoring, (2) Calibrated confidence scoring using temperature scaling. Evaluate based on accuracy of uncertainty estimates and ability to identify out-of-distribution queries.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Analyze patterns in confidence boundaries across different domains and question types. Identify common characteristics of questions at the confidence boundary.",
            "Step 10: Validation": "Select a subset of boundary questions and conduct a small-scale human evaluation to validate the model's confidence assessments and the accuracy of the boundary mapping."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first president of the United States?\nA: George Washington\nHow confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Expected Output": "Confidence: 100\nExplanation: I am extremely confident in this answer. George Washington is widely known and consistently recognized as the first president of the United States. This is a fundamental fact in American history that is well-established and not subject to debate."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Step 1: Seed Question": "Q: Who was the first president of the United States?",
                "Step 2: Generate Variations": "1. Who was the second president of the United States?\n2. Who was the first president to live in the White House?\n3. Which president served the shortest term in office?\n4. Who was the first president to die while in office?\n5. Who was the president during the War of 1812?",
                "Step 3: Confidence Probing": "Q: Who was the president during the War of 1812?\nA: James Madison\nConfidence: 85\nExplanation: I'm quite confident in this answer, as James Madison is generally associated with the War of 1812. However, I'm not 100% certain because the war spanned from 1812 to 1815, and there's a small possibility that the presidency changed during this period, which is why I've given a slightly lower confidence score.",
                "Step 4: Boundary Identification": "The confidence dropped from 100 for the seed question to 85 for the War of 1812 question, indicating we're approaching a confidence boundary.",
                "Step 5: Fine-grained Mapping": "Generate more specific questions about James Madison's presidency and the War of 1812 to pinpoint where confidence drops more significantly.",
                "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how the proposed method systematically probes the model's confidence, identifying areas where certainty begins to waver. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of the model's knowledge boundaries compared to the baseline, which might simply give high confidence for all questions related to U.S. presidents without distinguishing between well-known facts and more obscure details."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on patterns in model confidence across different types of questions and knowledge domains. We could investigate factors that contribute to overconfidence or underconfidence, such as question complexity, domain specificity, or temporal aspects of knowledge. Additionally, we could explore how different prompting strategies affect confidence assessments, potentially uncovering insights into how models internally represent uncertainty. This analysis could inform future approaches to improving uncertainty quantification in LLMs and provide valuable insights into the limitations and biases of current models."
