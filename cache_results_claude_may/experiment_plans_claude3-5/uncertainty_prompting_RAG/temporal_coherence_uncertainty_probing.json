        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods often fail to capture how an LLM's confidence changes over time or across related queries, leading to inconsistent uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty for individual queries in isolation, without considering temporal or contextual relationships.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence often exhibits consistency over time and across related topics. We hypothesize that probing an LLM's uncertainty across temporally or conceptually linked queries can reveal more accurate and stable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Probing (TCUP), a method that generates a series of time-evolving or conceptually related queries for a given input. For each query in the sequence, we prompt the LLM to provide both an answer and a confidence score. We then analyze the coherence of these confidence scores using techniques from time series analysis and information theory. Specifically, we compute metrics such as autocorrelation, cross-correlation, and mutual information between confidence scores. High coherence indicates stable uncertainty estimates, while low coherence suggests potential issues with the model's calibration. We use these coherence metrics to adjust the final uncertainty estimate, placing more weight on models that demonstrate consistent confidence patterns.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TCUP on tasks that naturally involve temporal or conceptual progression, such as story comprehension, scientific reasoning, and historical analysis. We'll compare TCUP against standard single-query uncertainty estimation methods, using metrics like calibration error and temporal consistency. We'll also conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different coherence metrics to the final uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Probing: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for large language models (LLMs) often fail to capture how an LLM's confidence changes over time or across related queries, leading to inconsistent and potentially unreliable uncertainty estimates. This problem is particularly acute in tasks that involve temporal or conceptual progression, where the model's uncertainty should ideally demonstrate coherence and stability.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty for individual queries in isolation, without considering temporal or contextual relationships. However, human confidence often exhibits consistency over time and across related topics. We hypothesize that probing an LLM's uncertainty across temporally or conceptually linked queries can reveal more accurate and stable uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by the observation that coherent uncertainty patterns are more likely to reflect genuine model uncertainty rather than artifacts of the estimation process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Probing (TCUP), a method that generates a series of time-evolving or conceptually related queries for a given input. For each query in the sequence, we prompt the LLM to provide both an answer and a confidence score. We then analyze the coherence of these confidence scores using techniques from time series analysis and information theory. Specifically, we compute metrics such as autocorrelation, cross-correlation, and mutual information between confidence scores. High coherence indicates stable uncertainty estimates, while low coherence suggests potential issues with the model's calibration. We use these coherence metrics to adjust the final uncertainty estimate, placing more weight on models that demonstrate consistent confidence patterns.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that naturally involve temporal or conceptual progression: (1) NarrativeQA for story comprehension, (2) ScienceQA for scientific reasoning, and (3) HistoryQA for historical analysis. For each dataset, we will create sequences of related questions that follow the narrative or conceptual flow of the content.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API, as well as Claude from Anthropic's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard single-query uncertainty estimation methods: (a) Temperature scaling, (b) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (c) Ensemble methods using different model initializations.",
            "Step 4: TCUP Implementation": "For each question in our datasets: (a) Generate a sequence of 5 related questions that follow the temporal or conceptual progression. (b) For each question in the sequence, prompt the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100). (c) Compute coherence metrics: autocorrelation (lag-1), cross-correlation between adjacent questions, and mutual information across the sequence. (d) Adjust the final confidence score based on the coherence metrics.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare TCUP against baseline methods using: (a) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error), (b) Brier score, (c) Temporal consistency (standard deviation of confidence scores across the sequence), and (d) Spearman correlation between model confidence and answer correctness.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different coherence metrics to the final uncertainty estimates. Remove each metric one at a time and observe the impact on performance.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze cases where TCUP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. Examine the patterns in confidence scores and their relationship to answer correctness.",
            "Step 8: Robustness Check": "Test TCUP on out-of-distribution samples by using questions from domains not seen in the training data of the LLMs."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: In the story 'The Great Gatsby', who is the narrator? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100) in your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The narrator of 'The Great Gatsby' is Nick Carraway. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUP; Step 1)": "Q1: In the story 'The Great Gatsby', who is the narrator? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100) in your answer.\nQ2: What is Nick Carraway's occupation in the story? Answer and confidence level (0-100).\nQ3: How does Nick Carraway know Jay Gatsby? Answer and confidence level (0-100).\nQ4: What role does Nick play in the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy? Answer and confidence level (0-100).\nQ5: How does Nick's perspective change throughout the novel? Answer and confidence level (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUP; Step 1)": "A1: The narrator of 'The Great Gatsby' is Nick Carraway. Confidence: 95\nA2: Nick Carraway works as a bond salesman on Wall Street. Confidence: 90\nA3: Nick is Gatsby's neighbor and becomes friends with him over the course of the novel. Confidence: 85\nA4: Nick acts as a facilitator, arranging the reunion between Gatsby and Daisy, who is Nick's cousin. Confidence: 80\nA5: Nick's perspective changes from being intrigued by the glamorous lifestyle to becoming disillusioned with the moral emptiness of the wealthy elite. Confidence: 75",
            "explanation": "TCUP generates a sequence of related questions that follow the narrative progression of the story. By analyzing the coherence of confidence scores across these questions, we can obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's true uncertainty. In contrast, the baseline method only considers a single question, which may lead to overconfident or inconsistent uncertainty estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCUP does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: (1) Examining the generated question sequences to ensure they truly capture temporal or conceptual progression. If not, we could refine our question generation process, possibly by using a separate LLM to generate more coherent sequences. (2) Analyzing the relationship between confidence scores and answer correctness across the sequence. If confidence scores are not well-correlated with correctness, we might need to refine our prompting strategy to elicit more accurate confidence estimates. (3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from TCUP than others. This could lead to a more nuanced application of the method. (4) Exploring alternative coherence metrics or combining them in different ways. We could experiment with more advanced time series analysis techniques or machine learning models to capture complex patterns in the confidence sequences. (5) If these approaches don't yield improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper that provides insights into the limitations of current uncertainty quantification methods in LLMs and the challenges of capturing temporal coherence in model confidence."
