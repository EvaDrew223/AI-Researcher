        "Title": "Divergent Reasoning Uncertainty Quantification (DRUQ): Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with complex reasoning tasks that require exploring multiple potential solution paths. This limitation can lead to overconfident incorrect predictions or underconfident correct predictions, reducing the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like Chain-of-Thought prompting focus on linear reasoning paths and do not explicitly capture uncertainty across different reasoning branches. By encouraging LLMs to explore multiple divergent reasoning paths and quantify uncertainty at each branching point, we can obtain a more comprehensive and granular uncertainty estimate for complex problems. This approach mimics human problem-solving strategies, where we often consider multiple possibilities and weigh their likelihoods before arriving at a final answer.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Divergent Reasoning Uncertainty Quantification (DRUQ), a novel prompting method that guides LLMs to: 1) Generate multiple distinct reasoning paths for a given problem. 2) At each decision point, estimate a confidence score for each branch. 3) Propagate and aggregate uncertainties across the reasoning tree. 4) Produce a final answer along with a decomposed uncertainty estimate.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets are suitable for evaluating multi-step reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting: Direct question answering without additional instructions. b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Include 'Let's approach this step by step' instruction. c) Self-consistency: Generate multiple CoT paths and take the majority vote.",
            "Step 3: DRUQ Implementation": "Develop the DRUQ prompt template: 'Problem: {question}\nInstructions: 1) Explore 3 different approaches to solve this problem. 2) For each approach, break down your reasoning into steps. 3) At each step, assign a confidence score from 0-100%. 4) After exploring all approaches, combine the confidences to give an overall uncertainty estimate. 5) Provide your final answer and explain how you arrived at the overall uncertainty.\nSolution:'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the datasets: a) Apply all baseline methods and DRUQ. b) For DRUQ and self-consistency, generate 5 samples per problem to account for variability. c) Record the predicted answer, reasoning steps, and uncertainty estimates for DRUQ.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Accuracy: Percentage of correct final answers. b) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and empirical accuracy. c) Brier Score: Assess the quality of probabilistic predictions. d) Uncertainty-Accuracy Correlation: Measure how well uncertainty estimates correlate with correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare DRUQ against baselines on all metrics. b) Analyze the diversity of reasoning paths generated by DRUQ. c) Examine how uncertainty propagates through the reasoning steps. d) Investigate cases where DRUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "Janet's driveway is 9 feet wide. She needs to seal it and wants to calculate how many 1-quart cans of sealer she'll need if each quart covers 40 square feet. The driveway is 30 feet long. How many cans should she buy?",
                "Standard Prompt Output": "To solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Calculate the area of the driveway\n2. Determine how many square feet one can of sealer covers\n3. Divide the driveway area by the coverage of one can\n\nLet's go through it step by step:\n1. Area of the driveway = width \u00d7 length = 9 feet \u00d7 30 feet = 270 square feet\n2. Each quart covers 40 square feet\n3. Number of cans needed = 270 \u00f7 40 = 6.75\n\nSince Janet can't buy a fraction of a can, she should round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, Janet should buy 7 cans of sealer.",
                "Explanation": "The standard prompt provides a correct answer but doesn't quantify uncertainty or explore alternative approaches."
            },
            "Example 2 (DRUQ Success)": {
                "Input": "Janet's driveway is 9 feet wide. She needs to seal it and wants to calculate how many 1-quart cans of sealer she'll need if each quart covers 40 square feet. The driveway is 30 feet long. How many cans should she buy?",
                "DRUQ Output": "Let's explore three different approaches to solve this problem:\n\nApproach 1: Direct calculation\n1. Calculate the area of the driveway: 9 feet \u00d7 30 feet = 270 square feet (Confidence: 100%)\n2. Calculate the number of cans needed: 270 \u00f7 40 = 6.75 cans (Confidence: 100%)\n3. Round up to the nearest whole number: 7 cans (Confidence: 95%)\nOverall confidence for Approach 1: 98%\n\nApproach 2: Calculate excess and subtract\n1. Calculate the area of the driveway: 9 feet \u00d7 30 feet = 270 square feet (Confidence: 100%)\n2. Calculate the area covered by 6 cans: 6 \u00d7 40 = 240 square feet (Confidence: 100%)\n3. Calculate the remaining area: 270 - 240 = 30 square feet (Confidence: 100%)\n4. Determine if an additional can is needed: 30 > 0, so yes (Confidence: 100%)\n5. Total cans needed: 6 + 1 = 7 cans (Confidence: 100%)\nOverall confidence for Approach 2: 100%\n\nApproach 3: Use proportions\n1. Set up the proportion: x \u00f7 270 = 1 \u00f7 40 (Confidence: 90%)\n2. Cross multiply: 40x = 270 (Confidence: 95%)\n3. Solve for x: x = 270 \u00f7 40 = 6.75 (Confidence: 100%)\n4. Round up to the nearest whole number: 7 cans (Confidence: 95%)\nOverall confidence for Approach 3: 95%\n\nFinal Answer: Janet should buy 7 cans of sealer.\n\nOverall Uncertainty Estimate:\nAll three approaches arrived at the same answer of 7 cans. The confidence levels for each approach were 98%, 100%, and 95%. To combine these, we can take the average: (98 + 100 + 95) \u00f7 3 = 97.67%\n\nTherefore, the overall confidence in the answer is approximately 98%, with an uncertainty of about 2%.\n\nExplanation: The high confidence comes from the consistency across different approaches and the straightforward nature of the calculations involved. The small uncertainty accounts for potential real-world factors not mentioned in the problem, such as the exact coverage of each can or the possibility of spillage.",
                "Explanation": "DRUQ explores multiple reasoning paths, assigns confidence scores at each step, and provides a final uncertainty estimate. This approach offers a more comprehensive understanding of the problem-solving process and the model's confidence in its answer."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DRUQ does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine: 1) The quality and diversity of generated reasoning paths - are they truly distinct or just rephrasing the same approach? 2) The accuracy of confidence estimates at each step - does the model struggle to assign meaningful probabilities? 3) The aggregation method for overall uncertainty - is our simple averaging approach too naive? We could experiment with alternative aggregation methods, such as weighted averages based on the complexity of each reasoning path. Additionally, we could investigate whether DRUQ performs better on certain types of problems and worse on others, potentially leading to insights about task-specific uncertainty quantification strategies. If these analyses yield interesting patterns, we could refocus the paper on providing a detailed examination of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in self-assessing uncertainty across different reasoning tasks."
