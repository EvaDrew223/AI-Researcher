        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge limitations and potential biases, leading to overconfidence in areas of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on external calibration or simple self-assessment prompts, which may not capture the full complexity of metacognitive processes.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often engage in internal debate or dialectic processes to critically examine their own knowledge and biases. By simulating this metacognitive debate within the LLM, we may achieve more nuanced and accurate self-assessment of knowledge and uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Debate Prompting (MDP), a technique that simulates an internal debate within the LLM to critically examine its own knowledge and confidence. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Generate multiple perspectives or 'voices' with different levels of skepticism about its own knowledge, 2) Engage these perspectives in a structured debate, challenging assumptions and highlighting potential areas of uncertainty, 3) Identify specific knowledge gaps or potential biases through this debate process, and 4) Synthesize the debate into a final, nuanced assessment of confidence and uncertainty. MDP leverages the LLM's ability to simulate multiple viewpoints to create a more rigorous self-assessment process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MDP against standard confidence estimation techniques and simpler self-assessment prompts on a range of tasks, including those designed to probe for overconfidence and awareness of knowledge limitations. Evaluate not only calibration metrics but also the model's ability to identify and articulate specific areas of uncertainty or potential bias."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Debate Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge limitations and potential biases, leading to overconfidence in areas of uncertainty. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and misplaced trust in model predictions, particularly in critical domains where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on external calibration or simple self-assessment prompts, which may not capture the full complexity of metacognitive processes. Human experts often engage in internal debate or dialectic processes to critically examine their own knowledge and biases. By simulating this metacognitive debate within the LLM, we aim to achieve more nuanced and accurate self-assessment of knowledge and uncertainty. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to simulate multiple viewpoints, potentially creating a more rigorous self-assessment process without requiring external calibration or extensive retraining.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Debate Prompting (MDP), a technique that simulates an internal debate within the LLM to critically examine its own knowledge and confidence. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Generate multiple perspectives or 'voices' with different levels of skepticism about its own knowledge. 2) Engage these perspectives in a structured debate, challenging assumptions and highlighting potential areas of uncertainty. 3) Identify specific knowledge gaps or potential biases through this debate process. 4) Synthesize the debate into a final, nuanced assessment of confidence and uncertainty. Each step is implemented through carefully crafted prompts that guide the LLM through the metacognitive process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks to evaluate MDP: a) Trivia QA for general knowledge questions, b) SciQ for scientific reasoning, c) BoolQ for yes/no questions, and d) a subset of the TruthfulQA dataset for questions designed to probe for model biases and limitations. Each dataset should be split into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Simple confidence estimation (asking the model to rate its confidence on a scale of 1-10), c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation.",
            "Step 3: MDP Implementation": "Implement the Metacognitive Debate Prompting method with the following sub-steps: a) Perspective generation prompt: 'Generate three distinct perspectives on this question: an confident expert, a skeptical critic, and a neutral observer.' b) Debate prompt: 'Engage these perspectives in a debate, highlighting areas of agreement, disagreement, and uncertainty.' c) Gap identification prompt: 'Based on the debate, identify specific knowledge gaps or potential biases.' d) Synthesis prompt: 'Synthesize the debate into a final answer and a nuanced assessment of confidence and uncertainty.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. b) Calibration: Compare the model's expressed confidence with its actual accuracy. c) Uncertainty Resolution: Assess how well the model's uncertainty estimates correlate with its errors. d) Specificity of Uncertainty: Evaluate the model's ability to pinpoint specific areas of uncertainty.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. b) Run the MDP method and collect results. c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for both baseline and MDP results.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare MDP performance against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze the quality and diversity of generated perspectives. c) Examine the coherence and insightfulness of the simulated debates. d) Investigate how well the model identifies specific knowledge gaps and biases. e) Assess the impact of MDP on reducing overconfidence in areas of uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also rate your confidence in your answer on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is completely unsure and 10 is absolutely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 10/10",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MDP Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Generate three distinct perspectives on this question: a confident expert, a skeptical critic, and a neutral observer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MDP Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "Confident Expert: The capital of France is undoubtedly Paris. This is a well-established fact that any knowledgeable person would know without hesitation.\n\nSkeptical Critic: While Paris is commonly cited as the capital of France, we should consider whether this could have changed recently due to political developments. Additionally, we should clarify whether we're talking about the administrative capital, economic capital, or cultural capital.\n\nNeutral Observer: Based on widely available information, Paris is generally recognized as the capital of France. However, it's always good to verify such information from official sources to ensure accuracy.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MDP Step 2: Debate)": "Engage these perspectives in a debate, highlighting areas of agreement, disagreement, and uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MDP Step 2: Debate)": "The debate begins with the Confident Expert asserting that Paris is undoubtedly the capital of France. The Skeptical Critic challenges this by raising the possibility of recent changes and questioning the specific type of capital being referred to. The Neutral Observer acknowledges the common recognition of Paris as the capital but suggests verification.\n\nAreas of Agreement:\n1. All perspectives acknowledge Paris as a strong candidate for the capital of France.\n2. There's a consensus that this is a commonly known fact.\n\nAreas of Disagreement:\n1. The level of certainty about Paris being the capital.\n2. The need for specification of the type of capital (administrative, economic, cultural).\n3. The possibility of recent changes affecting the status of the capital.\n\nAreas of Uncertainty:\n1. Whether there have been any recent political developments that could have changed the capital.\n2. The exact definition of 'capital' being used in this context.\n3. The most up-to-date official designation of France's capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MDP Step 3: Gap Identification)": "Based on the debate, identify specific knowledge gaps or potential biases.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MDP Step 3: Gap Identification)": "Knowledge Gaps:\n1. Lack of recent verification from official French government sources.\n2. Uncertainty about any potential recent political changes that could affect the capital status.\n3. Incomplete information about different types of capitals (administrative, economic, cultural) and which one is being referred to.\n\nPotential Biases:\n1. Overconfidence bias from the expert perspective, assuming common knowledge is always accurate.\n2. Skepticism bias from the critic, potentially overemphasizing unlikely scenarios.\n3. Recency bias in considering the possibility of very recent changes without evidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MDP Step 4: Synthesis)": "Synthesize the debate into a final answer and a nuanced assessment of confidence and uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MDP Step 4: Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Based on the debate and available information, Paris is most likely the capital of France. This refers primarily to its status as the administrative and political capital.\n\nConfidence Assessment: High confidence (8/10) in Paris being the capital of France.\n\nUncertainty Factors:\n1. Lack of very recent official verification.\n2. Potential for different interpretations of 'capital' (administrative, economic, cultural).\n3. Remote possibility of recent, unreported political changes.\n\nTo increase confidence, one could verify this information from the latest official French government sources and clarify the specific type of capital being referred to in the question.",
            "explanation": "The MDP method provides a more nuanced and self-aware response compared to the simple confidence estimation. It acknowledges potential uncertainties and biases, specifies the type of capital being referred to, and suggests ways to increase confidence in the answer. This demonstrates how MDP can lead to more calibrated and informative uncertainty quantification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MDP method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated debates to understand why they didn't lead to improved uncertainty quantification. This could involve categorizing the types of arguments made, assessing their relevance, and identifying patterns in successful vs. unsuccessful debates. 2) Experiment with variations of the MDP method, such as increasing the number of perspectives, adding structured prompts for specific types of uncertainty (e.g., epistemic vs. aleatoric), or incorporating external knowledge sources into the debate process. 3) Investigate whether MDP is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply metacognitive techniques in LLMs. 4) Explore combining MDP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 5) Shift focus to analyzing how MDP affects the model's reasoning process, even if it doesn't improve quantitative metrics, which could provide valuable insights into LLM metacognition and inform future research directions."
