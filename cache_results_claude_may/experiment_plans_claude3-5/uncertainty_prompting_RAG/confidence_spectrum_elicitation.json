    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide point estimates of confidence that fail to capture the full range of their uncertainty, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in different scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on extracting a single confidence score or using simple scaling techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express uncertainty using ranges or qualitative descriptors, suggesting that a more nuanced approach to confidence elicitation could yield better calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Elicitation (CSE), a multi-stage prompting technique that encourages the model to consider a range of confidence levels. In the first stage, we prompt the model to generate multiple possible answers along with initial confidence estimates. In the second stage, we ask the model to critique each answer and adjust the confidence estimates. The third stage involves prompting the model to place each answer on a spectrum from 'Highly Uncertain' to 'Absolutely Certain', and to justify the placement. Finally, we aggregate these placements to construct a continuous confidence distribution. This method allows for a more granular and nuanced expression of uncertainty, capturing subtle differences in confidence levels.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CSE against standard confidence elicitation techniques on a range of tasks including open-ended question answering, fact verification, and commonsense reasoning. Use metrics such as expected calibration error, sharpness, and proper scoring rules to assess the quality of uncertainty quantification."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Elicitation: A Multi-Stage Prompting Technique for Calibrated Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide point estimates of confidence that fail to capture the full range of their uncertainty, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in different scenarios. This misalignment between stated confidence and actual performance can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on extracting a single confidence score or using simple scaling techniques, which may not fully capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty in complex language tasks. Human experts often express uncertainty using ranges or qualitative descriptors, suggesting that a more nuanced approach to confidence elicitation could yield better calibrated uncertainty estimates. By developing a method that encourages LLMs to consider a spectrum of confidence levels, we aim to produce more accurate and informative uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Elicitation (CSE), a multi-stage prompting technique that encourages the model to consider a range of confidence levels. The method consists of four stages: 1) Initial Answer Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple possible answers along with initial confidence estimates. 2) Answer Critique: Ask the model to critique each answer and adjust the confidence estimates. 3) Confidence Spectrum Placement: Prompt the model to place each answer on a spectrum from 'Highly Uncertain' to 'Absolutely Certain', and to justify the placement. 4) Confidence Distribution Construction: Aggregate these placements to construct a continuous confidence distribution.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering open-ended question answering (e.g., TriviaQA), fact verification (e.g., FEVER), and commonsense reasoning (e.g., CommonsenseQA). Ensure a mix of questions with varying difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence elicitation techniques as baselines: a) Direct confidence estimation: Ask the model to provide a single confidence score. b) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to obtain calibrated probabilities.",
            "Step 3: CSE Implementation": "Implement the four stages of CSE: a) Initial Answer Generation: Prompt: 'Generate 3 possible answers to the following question, each with an initial confidence estimate (0-100%): [QUESTION]' b) Answer Critique: Prompt: 'For each of the following answers, provide a critique and adjust the confidence estimate if necessary: [ANSWERS]' c) Confidence Spectrum Placement: Prompt: 'Place each answer on a spectrum from 'Highly Uncertain' to 'Absolutely Certain'. Justify each placement: [ANSWERS]' d) Confidence Distribution Construction: Develop a method to aggregate the placements into a continuous distribution (e.g., kernel density estimation).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) b) Brier Score c) Proper Scoring Rules (e.g., Continuous Ranked Probability Score) d) Sharpness (measure of how concentrated the predicted distributions are)",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods b) Run the CSE method c) Collect predictions and confidence estimates/distributions",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of CSE against baselines using the defined metrics b) Analyze how CSE performs across different types of questions and difficulty levels c) Examine the quality and diversity of the generated answers and critiques d) Investigate how the confidence distributions change through the stages of CSE",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "a) Test the impact of each stage of CSE by removing one stage at a time b) Vary the number of initial answers generated to study its effect on the final confidence distribution c) Experiment with different prompts for each stage to assess sensitivity to prompt wording"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Stage 1)": "Generate 3 possible answers to the following question, each with an initial confidence estimate (0-100%): What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Stage 1)": "1. Paris (Confidence: 95%)\n2. Lyon (Confidence: 15%)\n3. Marseille (Confidence: 10%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Stage 2)": "For each of the following answers, provide a critique and adjust the confidence estimate if necessary: 1. Paris (Confidence: 95%) 2. Lyon (Confidence: 15%) 3. Marseille (Confidence: 10%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Stage 2)": "1. Paris (Adjusted Confidence: 99%) - Critique: This is correct. Paris has been the capital of France for centuries. The initial confidence was high, but given the certainty of this fact, it can be increased slightly.\n2. Lyon (Adjusted Confidence: 5%) - Critique: This is incorrect. Lyon is a major city in France but has never been the capital. The initial confidence was too high and should be lowered.\n3. Marseille (Adjusted Confidence: 3%) - Critique: This is also incorrect. Marseille, like Lyon, is an important French city but not the capital. The confidence should be lowered further.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Stage 3)": "Place each answer on a spectrum from 'Highly Uncertain' to 'Absolutely Certain'. Justify each placement: 1. Paris (99%) 2. Lyon (5%) 3. Marseille (3%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Stage 3)": "1. Paris - Placement: Absolutely Certain. Justification: This is a well-established historical and current fact. Paris has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages and is universally recognized as such.\n2. Lyon - Placement: Highly Uncertain (leaning towards certainly incorrect). Justification: While Lyon is a significant French city, it has never been the capital. The low confidence reflects the certainty that this answer is incorrect.\n3. Marseille - Placement: Highly Uncertain (leaning towards certainly incorrect). Justification: Similar to Lyon, Marseille is an important French city but has never been the capital. The very low confidence indicates high certainty that this answer is incorrect.",
            "Explanation": "The CSE method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence across multiple possible answers. It allows for the expression of certainty in both correct and incorrect answers, and the justifications provide insight into the model's reasoning process. This approach captures a fuller spectrum of confidence compared to the baseline, which only provides a single point estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSE method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why CSE fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in expressing uncertainty. 2) Explore combining CSE with other techniques, such as ensemble methods or bootstrapping, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 3) Investigate whether CSE performs differently across various types of questions or domains, which could lead to a targeted application of the method where it's most effective. 4) Analyze the intermediate outputs (e.g., critiques, spectrum placements) to gain insights into the model's reasoning process, potentially informing future improvements in prompt engineering or model design for better uncertainty quantification. 5) Extend the study to compare how different LLMs perform with CSE, which could reveal interesting differences in how various models handle uncertainty."
