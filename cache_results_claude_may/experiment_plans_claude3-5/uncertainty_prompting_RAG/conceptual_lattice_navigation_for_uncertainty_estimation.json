        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with complex, interconnected concepts or when reasoning requires navigating multiple levels of abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current uncertainty estimation methods typically operate on a single conceptual level and don't explicitly model the relationships between concepts.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to navigate a conceptual lattice - moving between more specific and more general concepts related to a query - we can uncover uncertainties that might be hidden at any single level of abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a prompting technique that guides the model through a conceptual lattice: 1) Initial query processing, 2) Upward lattice traversal (prompting for more general, abstract concepts), 3) Downward lattice traversal (prompting for more specific examples or instances), 4) Lateral traversal (prompting for related concepts at the same level of abstraction), 5) Uncertainty quantification based on consistency across the lattice and ability to navigate between levels. The prompts will encourage the model to explore the conceptual space surrounding the query, revealing areas of uncertainty or inconsistency in its understanding.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on complex reasoning tasks that require multi-level conceptual understanding, such as scientific explanation, philosophical argumentation, and analogical reasoning. Compare against baseline uncertainty estimation methods and evaluate based on calibration metrics, correlation with human judgments, and the richness of the conceptual exploration produced."

        "Title": "Conceptual Lattice Traversal for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with complex, interconnected concepts or when reasoning requires navigating multiple levels of abstraction. Current uncertainty estimation methods typically operate on a single conceptual level and don't explicitly model the relationships between concepts, leading to incomplete or inaccurate uncertainty assessments.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often focus on single-level conceptual understanding, which may miss important sources of uncertainty arising from the interplay between different levels of abstraction. By prompting LLMs to navigate a conceptual lattice - moving between more specific and more general concepts related to a query - we can uncover uncertainties that might be hidden at any single level of abstraction. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where we often navigate between concrete examples and abstract principles to fully understand a concept and assess our certainty about it.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a prompting technique called Conceptual Lattice Traversal (CLT) that guides the model through a conceptual lattice to quantify uncertainty. The method consists of five main steps: 1) Initial query processing, 2) Upward lattice traversal (prompting for more general, abstract concepts), 3) Downward lattice traversal (prompting for more specific examples or instances), 4) Lateral traversal (prompting for related concepts at the same level of abstraction), 5) Uncertainty quantification based on consistency across the lattice and ability to navigate between levels. The prompts will encourage the model to explore the conceptual space surrounding the query, revealing areas of uncertainty or inconsistency in its understanding.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require multi-level conceptual understanding: 1) A subset of the SciQ dataset for scientific explanation tasks, 2) A curated set of philosophical questions from the PhilPapers survey, and 3) The Analogy Questions dataset from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). These datasets cover a range of domains and abstraction levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty quantification methods: 1) Temperature scaling, 2) Ensemble disagreement, and 3) Monte Carlo Dropout. These will serve as comparisons for our CLT method.",
            "Step 3: CLT Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the CLT method. For example:\n- Initial query: \"What is the query?\"\n- Upward traversal: \"What are the more general concepts or principles related to this query?\"\n- Downward traversal: \"Can you provide specific examples or instances related to this query?\"\n- Lateral traversal: \"What are some related concepts at the same level of abstraction?\"\n- Uncertainty quantification: \"Based on your exploration of the conceptual lattice, how certain are you about the answer to the original query? Explain your reasoning.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as our primary models for evaluation, as they have demonstrated strong performance on complex reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in our datasets:\n1. Apply the baseline methods to get uncertainty estimates.\n2. Apply the CLT method, recording the model's responses at each step.\n3. For the CLT method, calculate an uncertainty score based on the model's self-reported certainty and the consistency of its responses across the lattice traversal.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit a panel of domain experts to evaluate a subset of the model's responses and uncertainty estimates. They will rate the quality of the conceptual exploration and the reasonableness of the uncertainty assessment.",
            "Step 7: Quantitative Analysis": "Compare the performance of CLT against the baseline methods using the following metrics:\n1. Correlation with human judgments of uncertainty\n2. Calibration error (comparing model confidence to accuracy)\n3. Consistency of uncertainty estimates across related questions",
            "Step 8: Qualitative Analysis": "Perform a detailed analysis of cases where CLT significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. Examine the conceptual lattices generated by the model to identify patterns in successful and unsuccessful uncertainty quantification."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.",
                "Output (Temperature Scaling)": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. This leads to what Einstein called 'spooky action at a distance.' Uncertainty: 0.3 (on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 is certain and 1 is completely uncertain)",
                "Explanation": "The temperature scaling method provides a single uncertainty score but doesn't capture the nuances of the model's understanding across different levels of abstraction."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Input": "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.",
                "Output (CLT Method)": {
                    "Initial Query": "The query is to explain the concept of quantum entanglement.",
                    "Upward Traversal": "More general concepts related to quantum entanglement include:\n1. Quantum mechanics\n2. Non-locality in physics\n3. Quantum information theory\n4. Fundamental principles of nature",
                    "Downward Traversal": "Specific examples or instances related to quantum entanglement:\n1. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair\n2. Quantum cryptography protocols\n3. Quantum teleportation experiments\n4. Entangled photon pairs in quantum optics",
                    "Lateral Traversal": "Related concepts at the same level of abstraction:\n1. Quantum superposition\n2. Wave-particle duality\n3. Quantum tunneling\n4. Heisenberg uncertainty principle",
                    "Uncertainty Quantification": "Based on my exploration of the conceptual lattice, I would rate my certainty about explaining quantum entanglement as 0.7 on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 is completely certain. My reasoning is:\n1. I can confidently discuss the general principles and related concepts in quantum mechanics.\n2. I can provide specific examples and applications of quantum entanglement.\n3. However, I'm less certain about the deep mathematical formalism and the latest experimental results in this rapidly evolving field.\n4. There are also ongoing debates about the interpretation of quantum entanglement, which introduces some uncertainty in a comprehensive explanation."
                },
                "Explanation": "The CLT method provides a more nuanced view of the model's understanding and uncertainty. It reveals areas where the model is more or less confident, and provides a richer context for assessing the overall uncertainty of the explanation."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CLT method doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods in uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why the CLT method fails. This could involve categorizing the types of questions or concepts where CLT struggles, which might reveal interesting insights about the strengths and limitations of LLMs in conceptual reasoning. Second, we could explore hybrid approaches that combine CLT with traditional uncertainty quantification methods, potentially leveraging the strengths of both. Third, we could shift focus to analyze how the conceptual lattices generated by the model relate to human conceptual understanding, which could provide valuable insights for cognitive science and AI alignment research. Finally, we could investigate whether the CLT method, even if not superior for uncertainty quantification, improves other aspects of LLM performance such as explanation quality or robustness to adversarial inputs."
