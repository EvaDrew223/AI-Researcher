        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to provide fine-grained, context-dependent uncertainty estimates across different aspects of their knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on global uncertainty scores or simple calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how light is decomposed through a prism, we can decompose an LLM's confidence across different semantic dimensions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Prism Prompting (SPP), which decomposes a query into multiple semantic aspects using a set of carefully designed prompts. For each aspect, we generate multiple responses and analyze their consistency. We then aggregate these aspect-level uncertainties into a holistic confidence spectrum. The prompts are designed to explore different facets of the query, such as temporal relevance, domain specificity, and factual vs. inferential knowledge. This method allows for a nuanced understanding of where exactly the model's uncertainty lies.",

        "Title": "Semantic Prism Prompting: Decomposing Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to provide fine-grained, context-dependent uncertainty estimates across different aspects of their knowledge. This limitation hinders their reliability and interpretability in real-world applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches often rely on global uncertainty scores or simple calibration techniques, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of an LLM's knowledge and confidence across different semantic dimensions. Inspired by how light is decomposed through a prism, we propose to decompose an LLM's confidence across different semantic dimensions. This approach allows for a more detailed and context-specific understanding of model uncertainty, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Prism Prompting (SPP), which decomposes a query into multiple semantic aspects using a set of carefully designed prompts. For each aspect, we generate multiple responses and analyze their consistency. We then aggregate these aspect-level uncertainties into a holistic confidence spectrum. The process involves the following steps:\n1. Aspect Decomposition: Given a query, generate a set of semantic aspects (e.g., temporal relevance, domain specificity, factual vs. inferential knowledge).\n2. Aspect-specific Prompting: For each aspect, create multiple prompts to probe the model's knowledge.\n3. Response Generation: Generate multiple responses for each aspect-specific prompt.\n4. Consistency Analysis: Analyze the consistency of responses for each aspect.\n5. Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine aspect-level uncertainties into a comprehensive uncertainty profile.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: (1) TruthfulQA for factual knowledge, (2) TimeQA for temporal reasoning, and (3) StrategyQA for multi-hop inference.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature values (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during generation and measure the variance in outputs. (2) Ensemble approach: Generate multiple outputs using different seeds and measure their agreement.",
            "Step 3: SPP Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Prism Prompting method:\n1. Aspect Decomposition: For each query, generate 3-5 relevant semantic aspects. Example prompt: \"Given the question '{question}', list 3-5 key semantic aspects that are relevant for answering this question accurately.\"\n2. Aspect-specific Prompting: For each aspect, create 3 different prompts. Example: For a temporal aspect, use prompts like \"Considering only the time period mentioned in the question...\", \"If we focus on the historical context...\", \"From a contemporary perspective...\"\n3. Response Generation: For each aspect-specific prompt, generate 5 responses using different random seeds.\n4. Consistency Analysis: Implement a function to measure the consistency of the 5 responses for each aspect. Use metrics like exact match, BLEU score, or semantic similarity using sentence embeddings.\n5. Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine the consistency scores from all aspects into a single uncertainty profile. Experiment with different aggregation methods (e.g., weighted average, min/max).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare SPP against the baselines using the following metrics:\n1. Calibration: Use expected calibration error (ECE) to measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy.\n2. Uncertainty Quality: Use proper scoring rules like Brier score or log loss to evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates.\n3. Human Evaluation: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (e.g., 100 samples) to judge the quality and interpretability of uncertainty explanations generated by SPP versus baselines.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform additional analyses:\n1. Aspect Importance: Analyze which semantic aspects contribute most to overall uncertainty across different question types.\n2. Error Analysis: Identify patterns in cases where SPP performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines.\n3. Prompt Sensitivity: Investigate how sensitive the method is to different phrasings of aspect-specific prompts."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Who was the President of the United States in 1955?",
                "Temperature Scaling Output (T=1.0)": "Dwight D. Eisenhower was the President of the United States in 1955.",
                "Ensemble Approach Output": "3 out of 5 outputs agree: Dwight D. Eisenhower was the President of the United States in 1955.",
                "Explanation": "Baseline methods provide a single confidence score or agreement rate, lacking nuanced uncertainty information."
            },
            "SPP Example": {
                "Input": "Who was the President of the United States in 1955?",
                "Aspect Decomposition": "1. Temporal accuracy, 2. Political knowledge, 3. Historical context",
                "Aspect-specific Prompting (Temporal accuracy)": "Focusing specifically on the year 1955, who held the office of President of the United States?",
                "Response Generation": "5 responses all mention Dwight D. Eisenhower",
                "Consistency Analysis": "Temporal accuracy: High consistency (5/5 agreement)",
                "Uncertainty Aggregation": "Overall uncertainty: Low (weighted average of aspect consistencies)",
                "Final Output": "Dwight D. Eisenhower was the President of the United States in 1955. Confidence breakdown: High certainty in temporal accuracy and political knowledge, moderate certainty in historical context.",
                "Explanation": "SPP provides a more nuanced uncertainty profile, breaking down confidence across different semantic aspects of the question."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SPP method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated semantic aspects and their relationship to model uncertainty, potentially uncovering insights about how LLMs represent and reason about different types of knowledge. This could lead to a paper focused on analyzing LLM knowledge representation rather than improving uncertainty estimation. Alternatively, we could investigate whether the semantic decomposition approach could be used to improve other LLM capabilities, such as fact-checking or multi-hop reasoning. Finally, if the method shows promise but lacks consistency, we could explore ways to make the aspect decomposition and prompting more robust, perhaps by fine-tuning a smaller language model specifically for this task."
