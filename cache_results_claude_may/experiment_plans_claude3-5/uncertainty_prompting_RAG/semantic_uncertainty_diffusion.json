    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that require reasoning across multiple domains or concepts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods, which can be unreliable or computationally expensive.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how humans break down complex problems and assess uncertainty at each step, we propose a method that diffuses uncertainty across a semantic network of related concepts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion, which decomposes a query into a graph of related concepts and sub-questions. The LLM is prompted to estimate uncertainty for each node, then propagate and aggregate these uncertainties through the graph. This process involves crafting prompts that guide the model to: 1) Decompose the query into a concept graph, 2) Estimate local uncertainties, 3) Propagate uncertainties between connected nodes, and 4) Aggregate the diffused uncertainties for a final calibrated estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion against direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MMLU and BigBench. Evaluate using calibration metrics and the ability to identify high-uncertainty queries."

        "Title": "Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Concept Graph Decomposition",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that require reasoning across multiple domains or concepts. This leads to overconfident predictions on tasks where the model's knowledge is limited or uncertain, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods, which can be unreliable or computationally expensive. Inspired by how humans break down complex problems and assess uncertainty at each step, we propose a method that diffuses uncertainty across a semantic network of related concepts. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to decompose problems and reason about relationships between concepts, potentially leading to more accurate and calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion, which decomposes a query into a graph of related concepts and sub-questions. The process involves the following steps: 1) Decompose the query into a concept graph, 2) Estimate local uncertainties for each node, 3) Propagate uncertainties between connected nodes, and 4) Aggregate the diffused uncertainties for a final calibrated estimate. This method aims to provide a more nuanced and accurate representation of the model's uncertainty by considering the interdependencies between different aspects of the query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) and BigBench. Select a subset of questions from diverse domains that require multi-step reasoning or integration of knowledge from multiple fields.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple forward passes with different prompts or temperatures to generate an ensemble of predictions and derive uncertainty from the variance in these predictions.",
            "Step 3: Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion Implementation": "a) Concept Graph Generation: Prompt the LLM to decompose the query into a graph of related concepts and sub-questions. Example prompt: 'Decompose the following question into a graph of related concepts and sub-questions: [QUESTION]'. b) Local Uncertainty Estimation: For each node in the graph, prompt the LLM to estimate its confidence in answering that sub-question. Example prompt: 'On a scale of 0 to 1, how confident are you in answering this sub-question: [SUB-QUESTION]?'. c) Uncertainty Propagation: Implement a simple propagation algorithm where uncertainties are passed between connected nodes based on their relationship strength. d) Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine the propagated uncertainties to produce a final calibrated uncertainty estimate for the original query.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. For comparison, we will also run experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "a) Accuracy: Compare the accuracy of answers produced by the baseline methods and Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion. b) Calibration: Use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) to evaluate how well the predicted uncertainties align with actual error rates. c) Uncertainty Quality: Assess the ability of each method to identify high-uncertainty queries using metrics like AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) for separating correct and incorrect predictions based on uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Concept Graph Analysis: Examine the generated concept graphs to understand how the LLM decomposes complex queries. b) Uncertainty Flow: Visualize how uncertainty propagates through the concept graph for different types of queries. c) Error Analysis: Identify patterns in queries where Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion performs better or worse than baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1: Baseline Failure": {
                "Input": "Q: In the context of climate change, how might the albedo effect of melting Arctic sea ice impact global temperature trends? Provide a confidence score for your answer on a scale of 0 to 1.",
                "Baseline Output": "A: The albedo effect of melting Arctic sea ice is likely to accelerate global warming. As sea ice melts, it exposes darker ocean water, which absorbs more sunlight than the reflective ice. This increased absorption of solar radiation leads to further warming, creating a positive feedback loop. This effect could significantly contribute to rising global temperatures, potentially accelerating the rate of climate change. Confidence score: 0.9",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score (0.9) for a complex question that involves multiple interacting factors. This overconfidence is problematic as it fails to account for the uncertainties in long-term climate predictions and the complexities of global climate systems."

                "Step 1: Concept Graph Generation": {
                    "Input": "Decompose the following question into a graph of related concepts and sub-questions: In the context of climate change, how might the albedo effect of melting Arctic sea ice impact global temperature trends?",

                "Step 2: Local Uncertainty Estimation": {
                    "Input": "For each sub-question, provide a confidence score on a scale of 0 to 1:\n1. What are the main drivers of climate change?\n2.

                },
                "Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation and Aggregation": "The system would propagate uncertainties through the concept graph, with lower confidence in complex relationships (e.g., 0.6 for sea ice effects on global currents) influencing the overall uncertainty.",
                "Final Output": "The albedo effect of melting Arctic sea ice is likely to contribute to warming global temperature trends. As sea ice melts, it exposes darker ocean water, which absorbs more sunlight than the reflective ice. This increased absorption of solar radiation leads to further warming, potentially creating a positive feedback loop. However, the exact magnitude of this effect on global temperatures is uncertain due to the complex interactions with other climate systems, such as ocean currents and weather patterns. While we're confident about the basic mechanism of the albedo effect, its long-term impact on global temperature trends involves more uncertainty. Confidence score: 0.72",
                "Explanation": "The Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion method provides a more nuanced and lower confidence score (0.72) compared to the baseline. It acknowledges the well-understood aspects (like the basic albedo effect) while also accounting for uncertainties in long-term predictions and complex global systems. This calibrated uncertainty is more appropriate for the complex nature of the question."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Semantic Uncertainty Diffusion method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated concept graphs to gain insights into how LLMs decompose complex queries. This could lead to a paper on LLM reasoning patterns across different domains. 2) Investigate why uncertainty propagation might be failing, potentially revealing limitations in how LLMs represent and manipulate uncertainty. 3) Explore alternative graph structures or propagation algorithms, such as using weighted edges or incorporating external knowledge bases to enhance the concept graphs. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where the method succeeds or fails, which could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in handling uncertainty across different types of queries and knowledge domains."
