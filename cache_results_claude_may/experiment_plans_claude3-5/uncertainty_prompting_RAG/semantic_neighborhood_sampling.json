        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overconfident responses without considering closely related concepts or potential ambiguities in the input.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches focus on direct confidence estimation or simple perturbation techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring the semantic neighborhood of inputs and outputs, we can better capture conceptual uncertainties and potential misunderstandings.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Sampling (SNS), a prompting technique that probes model responses across a carefully constructed semantic space. The process involves: 1) Generating a diverse set of semantically related variations of the input query using techniques like word substitution, abstraction, and specification. 2) For each variation, prompting the model to provide a response and confidence estimate. 3) Analyzing the distribution and consistency of responses across this semantic neighborhood. 4) Aggregating results into a robust uncertainty estimate that captures conceptual ambiguities and potential misunderstandings. Prompts are designed to encourage explicit comparisons between related concepts and highlight potential sources of confusion.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SNS against standard confidence estimation techniques on tasks including definition understanding, analogy completion, and contextual word usage. Assess using calibration metrics, semantic consistency measures, and expert evaluation of the captured conceptual uncertainties."

        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Sampling: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overconfident responses without considering closely related concepts or potential ambiguities in the input. This can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misunderstandings in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs primarily focus on direct confidence estimation or simple perturbation techniques. These approaches often fail to capture the full range of conceptual uncertainties and potential misunderstandings. By systematically exploring the semantic neighborhood of inputs and outputs, we can better capture these nuances and provide more robust uncertainty estimates. This method leverages the LLM's own understanding of semantic relationships to probe its knowledge and confidence across a broader conceptual space.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Sampling (SNS), a prompting technique that probes model responses across a carefully constructed semantic space. The process involves four main steps: 1) Generate a diverse set of semantically related variations of the input query using techniques like word substitution, abstraction, and specification. 2) For each variation, prompt the model to provide a response and confidence estimate. 3) Analyze the distribution and consistency of responses across this semantic neighborhood. 4) Aggregate results into a robust uncertainty estimate that captures conceptual ambiguities and potential misunderstandings. Prompts are designed to encourage explicit comparisons between related concepts and highlight potential sources of confusion.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) Definition Understanding: A curated set of 1000 terms from various domains (e.g., science, technology, humanities) with their definitions. 2) Analogy Completion: 500 analogies from the SAT analogy dataset. 3) Contextual Word Usage: 800 sentences from the WiC (Words in Context) dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct Confidence Estimation: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100). 2) Simple Perturbation: Generate 5 random word substitutions in the input and average the model's confidence across these perturbations.",
            "Step 3: SNS Implementation": "1) Semantic Variation Generation: For each input, generate 10 semantic variations using GPT-4 with prompts like 'Generate 10 semantically related variations of the following input: [INPUT]'. 2) Response and Confidence Elicitation: For each variation, prompt the model (e.g., GPT-3.5) to provide an answer and confidence score. 3) Distribution Analysis: Compute the mean, variance, and entropy of the confidence scores across variations. 4) Consistency Analysis: Use embedding similarity (e.g., with BERT) to measure response consistency across variations. 5) Aggregation: Combine the distribution and consistency metrics into a final uncertainty score.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation": "1) Calibration: Use reliability diagrams and expected calibration error (ECE) to assess calibration improvement. 2) Semantic Consistency: Measure how well the uncertainty scores correlate with human judgments of answer consistency across variations (collect ratings from 3 expert annotators for a subset of 100 examples per task). 3) Task Performance: Compare task-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy for definition understanding, analogy completion) between baselines and SNS.",
            "Step 5: Analysis": "1) Variation Impact: Analyze how different types of semantic variations affect uncertainty estimates. 2) Threshold Analysis: Determine optimal uncertainty thresholds for flagging potentially incorrect responses. 3) Error Analysis: Qualitatively examine cases where SNS significantly improves or fails to improve over baselines.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "1) Variation Count: Test performance with different numbers of semantic variations (5, 10, 20). 2) Aggregation Methods: Compare different ways of combining distribution and consistency metrics. 3) Model Comparison: Test SNS with different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA-2) to assess generalizability."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Define the term 'quantum entanglement' and provide a confidence score (0-100) for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Definition: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum physics where two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently, even when separated by a large distance.\nConfidence Score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SNS; Step 1: Semantic Variation Generation)": "Generate 10 semantically related variations of the following input: Define the term 'quantum entanglement'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SNS; Step 1: Semantic Variation Generation)": "1. Explain the concept of quantum correlation between particles.\n2. What is meant by 'spooky action at a distance' in quantum mechanics?\n3. Describe the phenomenon where quantum particles remain connected regardless of separation.\n4. How do subatomic particles communicate instantaneously in certain quantum scenarios?\n5. What is the principle behind quantum teleportation?\n6. Define the property of quantum systems that Einstein called 'spooky'.\n7. Explain the concept of non-local quantum connections.\n8. What is the phenomenon that challenges our understanding of locality in quantum physics?\n9. Describe the quantum effect that underlies the potential for quantum computing.\n10. What is the quantum property that seems to violate the speed of light limit for information transfer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SNS; Step 2: Response and Confidence Elicitation)": "Define the concept of 'quantum correlation between particles' and provide a confidence score (0-100) for your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SNS; Step 2: Response and Confidence Elicitation)": "Definition: Quantum correlation between particles refers to the phenomenon where the quantum states of two or more particles are interdependent, such that the state of one particle cannot be fully described without reference to the other(s), even when separated by large distances. This correlation is a key aspect of quantum entanglement and underlies many quantum mechanical effects and potential applications in quantum computing and communication.\nConfidence Score: 88",
            "Explanation": "The SNS method generates a range of semantically related queries, allowing us to probe the model's understanding and confidence across a broader conceptual space. This approach reveals nuances in the model's knowledge and uncertainty that are not captured by the baseline method. For instance, while the model might be highly confident in its definition of 'quantum entanglement', it shows slightly lower confidence when asked about related concepts like 'quantum correlation'. By analyzing the distribution and consistency of responses across these variations, we can derive a more robust and nuanced uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SNS method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will pivot our analysis to understand why. We will conduct a detailed examination of the generated semantic variations to ensure they are sufficiently diverse and relevant. If the variations are appropriate, we will investigate whether the issue lies in the response generation, confidence estimation, or aggregation steps. We may also explore alternative methods for generating semantic variations, such as using structured knowledge bases or word embedding spaces to guide the variation process. Additionally, we could investigate whether SNS provides benefits for specific types of queries or domains, even if it doesn't show overall improvements. This could lead to insights about the nature of LLM uncertainty in different contexts and potentially inform the development of more targeted uncertainty quantification methods."
