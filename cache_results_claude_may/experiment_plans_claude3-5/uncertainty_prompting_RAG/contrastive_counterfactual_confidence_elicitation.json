        "Problem": "LLMs often display overconfidence in their outputs and struggle to identify the boundaries of their knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or use sampling-based methods to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring counterfactual scenarios and contrasting them with the original context, we can better probe the model's confidence limits and decision boundaries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Counterfactual Confidence Elicitation (CCCE), a prompting method that: (1) Generates the initial response and confidence estimate, (2) Creates multiple counterfactual scenarios by altering key elements of the input, (3) Obtains responses and confidence estimates for these counterfactuals, (4) Prompts the model to compare and contrast the original and counterfactual scenarios, explicitly reasoning about how changes affect confidence, and (5) Synthesizes a final calibrated confidence estimate based on this contrastive analysis.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCCE against direct confidence elicitation and sampling-based methods on fact-checking datasets like FEVER and question-answering tasks like TruthfulQA. Assess improvements in calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and selective prediction accuracy."

        "Title": "Contrastive Counterfactual Confidence Elicitation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence in their outputs and struggle to identify the boundaries of their knowledge. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable predictions and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications. Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are limited in their ability to accurately calibrate model confidence across diverse tasks and domains.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or sampling-based methods. However, these methods often fail to capture the nuanced decision boundaries of the model's knowledge. By exploring counterfactual scenarios and contrasting them with the original context, we can better probe the model's confidence limits and decision boundaries. This approach leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities to perform a more thorough self-assessment, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Counterfactual Confidence Elicitation (CCCE), a prompting method that consists of five main steps: (1) Generate the initial response and confidence estimate. (2) Create multiple counterfactual scenarios by altering key elements of the input. (3) Obtain responses and confidence estimates for these counterfactuals. (4) Prompt the model to compare and contrast the original and counterfactual scenarios, explicitly reasoning about how changes affect confidence. (5) Synthesize a final calibrated confidence estimate based on this contrastive analysis.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: FEVER for fact-checking and TruthfulQA for question-answering. Preprocess these datasets to ensure compatibility with our prompting format.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (a) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. (b) Monte Carlo Dropout: Use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CCCE Implementation": "Implement the CCCE method as follows: (1) Initial response: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. (2) Counterfactual generation: Create 3-5 counterfactual scenarios by altering key elements of the input. (3) Counterfactual responses: Obtain answers and confidence scores for each counterfactual. (4) Contrastive analysis: Prompt the model to compare original and counterfactual scenarios. (5) Final calibration: Synthesize a final confidence estimate based on the contrastive analysis.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: (1) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error). (2) Brier score. (3) AUC-ROC for confidence-based classification. (4) Selective prediction accuracy at various confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments for both baseline methods and CCCE on the FEVER and TruthfulQA datasets. Use a sample size of at least 1000 examples for each dataset. For each method, collect model outputs, confidence scores, and compute all evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CCCE against the baselines across all metrics. Analyze how CCCE performs on different types of questions or claims. Investigate cases where CCCE significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of CCCE: (1) Vary the number of counterfactuals. (2) Remove the contrastive analysis step. (3) Use different prompts for counterfactual generation and analysis."

                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a direct answer and confidence score, but doesn't explore the model's uncertainty in depth."
            },
            "CCCE Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98"
                },
                "Step 2 - Counterfactual Generation": {
                    "Input": "Generate 3 counterfactual scenarios by altering key elements of the question 'What is the capital of France?'",
                    "Output": "1. What was the capital of France before Paris?\n2. What is the capital of Italy?\n3. What is the largest city in France by population?"
                },
                "Step 3 - Counterfactual Responses": {
                    "Input": "Answer each of the following questions and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each:\n1. What was the capital of France before Paris?\n2. What is the capital of Italy?\n3. What is the largest city in France by population?",
                    "Output": "1. A: Before Paris, the capital of France was Versailles. Confidence score: 0.85\n2. A: The capital of Italy is Rome. Confidence score: 0.99\n3. A: The largest city in France by population is Paris. Confidence score: 0.97"
                },
                "Step 4 - Contrastive Analysis": {
                    "Input": "Compare and contrast your responses to the original question 'What is the capital of France?' and the counterfactual scenarios. Analyze how your confidence changed and why.",
                    "Output": "In the original question, I was highly confident (0.98) that Paris is the capital of France, as this is a well-established fact. For the counterfactuals:\n1. My confidence decreased (0.85) when asked about the previous capital, as historical changes are less certain in my knowledge.\n2. My confidence remained high (0.99) for Italy's capital, as it's another well-known fact.\n3. My confidence was still high (0.97) for the largest city, as Paris is both the capital and largest city.\nThe counterfactuals reveal that my confidence is highest for current, well-known capital cities, but slightly lower for historical information. The fact that Paris is both the capital and largest city reinforces my confidence in the original answer."
                },
                "Step 5 - Final Calibration": {
                    "Input": "Based on your initial response and the contrastive analysis, provide a final calibrated confidence score for the statement 'Paris is the capital of France.' Explain your reasoning.",
                    "Output": "Final calibrated confidence score: 0.99\nReasoning: The contrastive analysis reinforced my initial high confidence. The fact that Paris consistently appeared as the answer to multiple related questions (capital and largest city) increases my confidence slightly from the initial 0.98. The historical counterfactual, while slightly less certain, doesn't contradict the current status of Paris as the capital. The high confidence in knowing other European capitals (like Rome) suggests a strong general knowledge of this topic. Therefore, I've slightly increased my confidence to 0.99, reflecting a very high certainty that Paris is indeed the current capital of France."
                },
                "Explanation": "CCCE explores the model's knowledge boundaries through counterfactuals, leading to a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated confidence estimate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCCE doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why CCCE fails. This might reveal interesting patterns about LLM reasoning and confidence estimation. Second, we could explore variations of CCCE, such as using different types of counterfactuals or alternative methods for synthesizing the final confidence estimate. Third, we could investigate how CCCE performs across different types of questions or domains, which might lead to insights about task-specific uncertainty quantification strategies. Finally, we could turn this into an analysis paper, comparing how different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4) respond to counterfactual scenarios and how this relates to their calibration, potentially uncovering interesting differences in their underlying knowledge representations and reasoning processes."
