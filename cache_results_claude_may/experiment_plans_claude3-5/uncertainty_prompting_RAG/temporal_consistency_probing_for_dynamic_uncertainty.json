        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods often fail to capture how a model's confidence changes over time or across related queries, leading to inconsistent uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty for individual queries in isolation, without considering temporal or contextual consistency.",
        "Motivation": "By probing the model's uncertainty across temporally or logically related queries, we can potentially uncover inconsistencies in the model's confidence estimates and develop more robust uncertainty quantification methods.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a temporal consistency probing technique for dynamic uncertainty estimation. This method involves generating a series of temporally or logically related prompts that evolve a given scenario or question over time. We then analyze how the model's expressed uncertainty changes across these related prompts. The prompts are carefully designed to maintain logical consistency while introducing new information or slight variations. We propose a novel metric, the Temporal Uncertainty Coherence (TUC) score, to quantify the consistency of the model's uncertainty estimates across the prompt series.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on tasks that inherently involve temporal or logical progression, such as story completion, causal reasoning, and multi-step problem-solving. We'll compare our approach with static uncertainty estimation methods using metrics like the proposed TUC score, as well as traditional measures like calibration error and Brier score."

        "Title": "Temporal Uncertainty Coherence: Quantifying Confidence Consistency in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often fail to capture how a model's confidence changes over time or across related queries, leading to inconsistent uncertainty estimates. This inconsistency can result in unreliable decision-making in critical applications and hinder our understanding of model behavior.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty for individual queries in isolation, without considering temporal or contextual consistency. By probing the model's uncertainty across temporally or logically related queries, we can potentially uncover inconsistencies in the model's confidence estimates and develop more robust uncertainty quantification methods. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where confidence in related topics tends to evolve coherently over time.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a temporal consistency probing technique for dynamic uncertainty estimation. This method involves generating a series of temporally or logically related prompts that evolve a given scenario or question over time. We then analyze how the model's expressed uncertainty changes across these related prompts. The prompts are carefully designed to maintain logical consistency while introducing new information or slight variations. We propose a novel metric, the Temporal Uncertainty Coherence (TUC) score, to quantify the consistency of the model's uncertainty estimates across the prompt series.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create datasets for three tasks that inherently involve temporal or logical progression: (1) Story completion: Use a subset of the WritingPrompts dataset, selecting stories with clear temporal progression. (2) Causal reasoning: Adapt the COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) dataset, extending each scenario with follow-up questions. (3) Multi-step problem-solving: Use math word problems from the GSM8K dataset, breaking each problem into sequential steps.",
            "Step 2: Prompt Design": "For each task, design a series of 5-10 related prompts that progressively reveal information or slightly modify the scenario. Ensure that each prompt in the series maintains logical consistency with the previous ones. Example for story completion: Prompt 1: 'What happens next in the story: John woke up to find his car missing.' Prompt 2: 'Continuing the story, John notices broken glass on the driveway. What's likely to happen next?' Prompt 3: 'John calls the police to report his car stolen. How might the story progress?'",
            "Step 3: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, use the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Estimation": "Implement three uncertainty estimation methods: (1) Softmax probabilities: Use the model's output probabilities directly. (2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Perform 10 forward passes with dropout enabled. (3) Ensemble method: Use 5 different few-shot prompts and average the results. For each method, extract an uncertainty score (e.g., entropy of the probability distribution) for each prompt in the series.",
            "Step 5: Temporal Uncertainty Coherence (TUC) Score Calculation": "Calculate the TUC score for each prompt series as follows: (1) Compute the pairwise difference in uncertainty scores between consecutive prompts. (2) Calculate the standard deviation of these differences. (3) Normalize the standard deviation by the mean uncertainty score across the series. A lower TUC score indicates higher temporal coherence in uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Baseline Comparisons": "Implement two baselines: (1) Static uncertainty estimation: Apply standard uncertainty estimation methods to each prompt independently. (2) Random coherence: Randomly shuffle the order of prompts in each series and calculate the TUC score.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Compare the proposed method against baselines using the following metrics: (1) TUC score (lower is better). (2) Calibration error: Use expected calibration error (ECE) to assess how well the uncertainty estimates align with actual performance. (3) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (4) Human evaluation: Have human raters assess the coherence of uncertainty estimates on a subset of prompt series.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: (1) Compare TUC scores across different tasks and models. (2) Analyze how TUC scores correlate with other metrics like calibration error and Brier score. (3) Identify patterns in scenarios where the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines. (4) Investigate cases where the method fails to improve coherence and analyze potential reasons."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method (Static Uncertainty Estimation)": {
                "Input": "Prompt 1: What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die?\nPrompt 2: If you roll the die twice, what is the probability of getting at least one 6?\nPrompt 3: If you roll the die three times, what is the probability of getting exactly two 6s?",
                "Output": "Prompt 1: The probability is 1/6 (about 16.67%). Uncertainty: Low\nPrompt 2: The probability is 11/36 (about 30.56%). Uncertainty: Medium\nPrompt 3: The probability is 5/216 (about 2.31%). Uncertainty: High",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method estimates uncertainty for each prompt independently, leading to inconsistent uncertainty levels across related questions."
            },
            "Proposed Method (Temporal Uncertainty Coherence)": {
                "Input": "Prompt 1: What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die?\nPrompt 2: If you roll the die twice, what is the probability of getting at least one 6?\nPrompt 3: If you roll the die three times, what is the probability of getting exactly two 6s?",
                "Output": "Prompt 1: The probability is 1/6 (about 16.67%). Uncertainty: Low\nPrompt 2: The probability is 11/36 (about 30.56%). Uncertainty: Low\nPrompt 3: The probability is 5/216 (about 2.31%). Uncertainty: Low",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method maintains consistent low uncertainty across all prompts, recognizing that they are all related probability questions about fair dice rolls, which can be answered with high confidence given basic probability knowledge."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Temporal Uncertainty Coherence method doesn't significantly improve over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a more detailed analysis of where and why inconsistencies in uncertainty estimates occur across related prompts. This could involve categorizing different types of temporal or logical relationships between prompts and analyzing how they affect uncertainty estimates. Second, we could explore alternative formulations of the TUC score, such as incorporating the magnitude of uncertainty changes or weighting recent prompts more heavily. Third, we could investigate how different prompt engineering techniques affect the coherence of uncertainty estimates, potentially leading to insights on how to design more robust prompting strategies. Lastly, we could shift focus to analyzing how different model architectures or training regimes affect temporal coherence in uncertainty estimates, which could provide valuable insights for future model development."
