        "Title": "Uncertainty Resonance Prompting: Amplifying Uncertainty Signals in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple plausible answers exist. This inability to accurately express uncertainty can lead to overconfident incorrect answers or underconfident correct answers, potentially misleading users and limiting the models' applicability in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting with confidence scores or ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties. These methods typically rely on a single, static prompt or a limited set of model instances, which may not fully explore the model's internal representations of uncertainty. Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, where systems respond more strongly to certain frequencies, we propose to exploit the model's internal representations to amplify uncertainty signals. By iteratively probing the model with slight variations of the original question, each designed to resonate with different aspects of the model's uncertainty, we aim to construct a more accurate and comprehensive uncertainty profile.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Resonance Prompting (URP), which involves iteratively probing the model with slight variations of the original question, each designed to resonate with different aspects of the model's uncertainty. The process works as follows: 1) Present the original question to the model and obtain an initial answer and confidence score. 2) Generate a set of 'aspect prompts' using the model itself, asking it to identify potential sources of uncertainty in the question. 3) For each aspect prompt, construct a resonant prompt of the form: 'Original question. Considering [aspect], how might this affect your answer? Rate your confidence in your original answer now.' 4) Present each resonant prompt to the model and record the new confidence scores. 5) Analyze the pattern of confidence fluctuations across these resonant prompts to construct a more accurate uncertainty profile. 6) Use this uncertainty profile to calibrate the model's final confidence score and potentially refine its answer.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from datasets like ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) for science questions and BIG-bench for diverse reasoning tasks. Select a subset of 1000 questions from each dataset, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard few-shot prompting with confidence scores. b) Ensemble method using 5 different model instances or seeds. c) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation (if using an open-source model that allows this).",
            "Step 3: URP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Resonance Prompting method as follows: a) Function to generate aspect prompts: 'Given the question: [QUESTION], list 5 aspects that could introduce uncertainty in answering this question.' b) Function to construct resonant prompts using the template described in the method. c) Function to analyze confidence fluctuations and construct the uncertainty profile.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our main experiments. Additionally, we'll use the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparisons and to test the generalizability of our method.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in our dataset: a) Apply each baseline method and record the answer and confidence score. b) Apply URP: i) Get initial answer and confidence. ii) Generate aspect prompts. iii) Construct and apply resonant prompts. iv) Analyze confidence fluctuations. v) Generate final calibrated confidence score and potentially refined answer.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare the calibrated confidence scores with actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) ECE (Expected Calibration Error): Measure the difference between confidence and accuracy. d) 'Uncertainty fidelity' measure: Have human experts annotate a subset of 100 questions for true task difficulty on a scale of 1-5. Compare the correlation between expert-rated difficulty and model uncertainty across methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare URP against baselines on all metrics. b) Analyze how URP performance varies with question difficulty. c) Examine the generated aspect prompts and their effectiveness in uncovering uncertainties. d) Investigate cases where URP significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: A pendulum's period is proportional to the square root of its length. If a pendulum with a length of 1 meter has a period of 2 seconds, what would be the period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "To solve this problem, let's use the relationship between the pendulum's length and its period. We know that the period is proportional to the square root of the length. Let's call the period T and the length L. We can write this relationship as:\n\nT \u221d \u221aL\n\nWe're given that when L = 1 meter, T = 2 seconds. Let's call the new period T' for the pendulum with L' = 4 meters.\n\nWe can set up the proportion:\nT / T' = \u221aL / \u221aL'\n\n2 / T' = \u221a1 / \u221a4\n2 / T' = 1 / 2\n\nSolving for T':\nT' = 2 * 2 = 4 seconds\n\nTherefore, a pendulum with a length of 4 meters would have a period of 4 seconds.\n\nConfidence level: 95\n\nI'm quite confident in this answer because it's a straightforward application of the given relationship between a pendulum's length and its period. The math involved is simple and there's little room for error in the calculation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: A pendulum's period is proportional to the square root of its length. If a pendulum with a length of 1 meter has a period of 2 seconds, what would be the period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "The period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters would be 4 seconds.\n\nConfidence level: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Generate Aspect Prompts)": "Given the question: A pendulum's period is proportional to the square root of its length. If a pendulum with a length of 1 meter has a period of 2 seconds, what would be the period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters? List 5 aspects that could introduce uncertainty in answering this question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Generate Aspect Prompts)": "1. The effect of air resistance on the pendulum's motion\n2. The assumption of small angle approximation in the pendulum equation\n3. The impact of the pendulum's mass on its period\n4. The potential influence of the Earth's rotation (Foucault effect)\n5. The precision of the measurement tools used for length and time",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Resonant Prompt)": "A pendulum's period is proportional to the square root of its length. If a pendulum with a length of 1 meter has a period of 2 seconds, what would be the period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters? Considering the effect of air resistance on the pendulum's motion, how might this affect your answer? Rate your confidence in your original answer now.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Resonant Prompt)": "Considering the effect of air resistance on the pendulum's motion, I realize that this could introduce some uncertainty into my original answer. Air resistance would slightly dampen the pendulum's motion, potentially increasing its period. However, for pendulums of typical size and speed, this effect is usually very small and often negligible in practical calculations.\n\nIn the ideal case without air resistance, my original answer of 4 seconds for a 4-meter pendulum is correct based on the proportional relationship T \u221d \u221aL. With air resistance, the actual period might be slightly longer, but the difference would likely be minimal and possibly not even measurable without very precise instruments.\n\nGiven this consideration, I would slightly lower my confidence in the exact value of 4 seconds, but I'm still quite confident that it's very close to the correct answer for most practical purposes.\n\nRevised confidence level: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Calibrated Answer)": "Based on the original question and the uncertainty analysis performed through resonant prompts, provide a final answer with a calibrated confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Calibrated Answer)": "Final Answer: The period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters would be approximately 4 seconds, assuming ideal conditions.\n\nCalibrated Confidence Score: 88\n\nExplanation: After considering various aspects that could introduce uncertainty, such as air resistance, small angle approximation, the pendulum's mass, Earth's rotation, and measurement precision, we've slightly reduced our confidence from the initial 95. While the mathematical relationship T \u221d \u221aL gives us a strong basis for the 4-second answer, real-world factors could cause slight deviations. The largest potential impact comes from air resistance and the assumption of small angle oscillations, but these effects are typically small for standard pendulum setups. The calibrated confidence of 88 reflects our high confidence in the approximate answer while acknowledging the presence of these minor sources of uncertainty.",
            "explanation": "The URP method demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of the problem's complexity. By considering various aspects that could introduce uncertainty, it provides a more calibrated confidence score. The final answer acknowledges potential real-world deviations from the ideal case, offering a more realistic assessment of the solution's accuracy."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed URP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated aspect prompts to understand which types of prompts are most effective at uncovering model uncertainty. This could lead to insights on how models represent and process uncertainty internally. 2) Investigate whether the effectiveness of URP varies across different types of reasoning tasks or question difficulties. This could help identify specific areas where the method is most beneficial. 3) Explore combining URP with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or Monte Carlo Dropout, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 4) Analyze cases where URP performs poorly to identify potential limitations of the method and propose improvements. 5) If the method consistently underperforms, we could pivot to a comparative study of different uncertainty estimation techniques across various reasoning tasks, providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach."
