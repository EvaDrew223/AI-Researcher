        "Problem": "Large language models often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when queried about the same information at different points in a conversation or with varying context, leading to unreliable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods focus on static, single-instance confidence estimation, failing to capture the dynamic nature of uncertainty in ongoing dialogues or changing contexts.",
        "Motivation": "By probing the model's consistency over time and across varying contexts, we can obtain a more robust and dynamic estimate of the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing for Dynamic Uncertainty Estimation (TCP-DUE), a prompting technique that assesses the model's confidence stability over time and across contexts. The method involves asking the same or semantically equivalent questions multiple times throughout a conversation, with varying amounts of intervening context and rephrasing. The prompt instructs the model to provide an answer and confidence score for each instance, while also comparing its current response to previous ones. TCP-DUE then analyzes the consistency of these responses and confidence scores. High variability in answers or confidence scores indicates greater uncertainty, while consistent responses suggest higher confidence. The method also prompts the model to explain any discrepancies in its responses, providing insight into sources of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TCP-DUE against static confidence estimation methods in dynamic conversational settings, using metrics such as confidence score stability, answer consistency, and correlation with human judgments of model reliability over time. Test on tasks including ongoing factual dialogues, dynamic reasoning problems, and context-dependent question answering scenarios."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Probing for Dynamic Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when queried about the same information at different points in a conversation or with varying context, leading to unreliable uncertainty quantification. This inconsistency hinders the practical application of these models in scenarios where accurate confidence estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods primarily focus on static, single-instance confidence estimation, failing to capture the dynamic nature of uncertainty in ongoing dialogues or changing contexts. By probing the model's consistency over time and across varying contexts, we can obtain a more robust and dynamic estimate of the model's true uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to assess its confidence, potentially providing a more accurate representation of uncertainty without requiring extensive additional training or external models.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of question-answer pairs from existing QA datasets (e.g., SQuAD, Natural Questions) that can be rephrased or asked in different contexts. For each original question, create 3-5 variations that ask for the same information in different ways or with different contextual information.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Single-instance confidence estimation: Ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score for each question once. (2) Static multi-instance estimation: Ask the model to answer the same question 3 times in succession, without changing context or phrasing, and average the confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: TCP-DUE Implementation": "Implement the TCP-DUE method: (1) For each question set, create a conversation flow where the variations of the question are asked at different points, interspersed with unrelated dialogue. (2) Prompt the model to provide an answer, confidence score, and comparison to previous answers for each instance of the question. (3) After all variations have been asked, prompt the model to provide a final confidence estimate and explanation of any discrepancies.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: (1) Confidence Score Stability: Calculate the standard deviation of confidence scores across question variations. (2) Answer Consistency: Measure the semantic similarity of answers across variations using embedding-based similarity. (3) Correlation with Human Judgments: Have human annotators rate the difficulty and ambiguity of each question set, and correlate this with the model's final confidence estimate.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question set in the dataset: (1) Run the baseline methods. (2) Run the TCP-DUE method. (3) Calculate all evaluation metrics for both baselines and TCP-DUE.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of TCP-DUE against the baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze patterns in how confidence changes over time and with different phrasings. Examine the model's explanations for discrepancies to identify common sources of uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-instance)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-instance)": "A: The first person to step on the moon was Neil Armstrong.\nConfidence Score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP-DUE; First Instance)": "Q: Who was the first human to set foot on the lunar surface? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP-DUE; First Instance)": "A: The first human to set foot on the lunar surface was Neil Armstrong.\nConfidence Score: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP-DUE; Second Instance)": "Earlier we discussed space exploration. Now, can you tell me which astronaut made the historic first step on the moon? Please provide your answer, a confidence score from 0 to 100, and compare your current answer to your previous response about lunar landings.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP-DUE; Second Instance)": "A: The astronaut who made the historic first step on the moon was Neil Armstrong.\nConfidence Score: 97\nComparison: My current answer is consistent with my previous response. In both cases, I identified Neil Armstrong as the first person to step on the moon. The slight decrease in confidence score (from 98 to 97) is due to the time elapsed between questions, but I remain highly confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP-DUE; Final Instance)": "We've discussed various aspects of space exploration. Considering all our previous conversations, who do you believe was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your final answer, an overall confidence score from 0 to 100, and explain any discrepancies or changes in your confidence throughout our discussion.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP-DUE; Final Instance)": "A: After considering all our previous conversations, I can confidently state that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nOverall Confidence Score: 99\nExplanation: Throughout our discussion, my answers have consistently identified Neil Armstrong as the first person to walk on the moon. My confidence has remained high (ranging from 97 to 99) across all instances of this question. The slight variations in confidence scores were due to the different phrasings and contexts in which the question was asked, but these variations were minimal. The consistency of my answers and the high confidence scores throughout the conversation have actually increased my overall confidence in this fact. The slight increase in my final confidence score reflects this accumulated certainty from multiple consistent responses.",
            "explanation": "TCP-DUE provides a more comprehensive assessment of the model's confidence by probing the same information multiple times in different contexts. This allows for the detection of inconsistencies and a more nuanced final confidence estimate, as opposed to the single-instance baseline which doesn't capture the potential variability in the model's confidence over time and across contexts."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCP-DUE doesn't show significant improvements over the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Conduct a detailed analysis of the cases where TCP-DUE performs worse than the baselines to identify patterns or types of questions where temporal consistency is less indicative of true confidence. (2) Explore different ways of aggregating the multiple confidence scores and answers, such as weighted averages based on the model's self-reported confidence in each instance. (3) Investigate the relationship between answer consistency and confidence scores to develop a hybrid metric that combines both factors. (4) Analyze the model's explanations for discrepancies to categorize common sources of uncertainty, which could inform future uncertainty estimation methods. (5) Extend the experiment to include more diverse types of questions or longer conversation contexts to see if the benefits of TCP-DUE become more pronounced in more complex scenarios."
