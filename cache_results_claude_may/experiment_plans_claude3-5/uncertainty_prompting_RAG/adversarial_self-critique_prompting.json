    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to identify potential flaws or weaknesses in their own reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current self-evaluation techniques typically involve simple reflection or confidence scoring.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to actively search for flaws in its own reasoning, we can potentially uncover hidden sources of uncertainty and improve calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting process. In the first stage, the model generates an initial response and confidence estimate. In the second stage, the model is prompted to act as an adversarial critic, actively searching for flaws, inconsistencies, or alternative interpretations in its initial response. The model then generates a critique, highlighting potential weaknesses. Finally, the model synthesizes the initial response and critique to produce a revised confidence estimate and uncertainty breakdown.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test this method on a range of tasks, including open-ended question answering and analytical reasoning problems. Compare against baseline self-evaluation techniques and assess improvements in calibration using metrics like Brier score and calibration curves. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated critiques to gain insights into the model's self-evaluation capabilities."

        "Title": "Two-Stage Self-Critique Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to accurately identify potential flaws or weaknesses in their own reasoning. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable or misleading information being presented as factual, which is particularly problematic in high-stakes decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current self-evaluation techniques for LLMs typically involve simple reflection or confidence scoring, which may not adequately capture the nuances of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. By prompting the model to actively search for flaws in its own reasoning through a structured two-stage process, we aim to uncover hidden sources of uncertainty and improve calibration. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to critique its reasoning, potentially leading to more robust and reliable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting process for improved uncertainty quantification:\n1. Initial Response and Confidence: The model generates an initial response to a given query, along with a confidence estimate.\n2. Self-Critique and Revision: The model is then prompted to act as an adversarial critic, actively searching for flaws, inconsistencies, or alternative interpretations in its initial response. It generates a critique highlighting potential weaknesses. Finally, the model synthesizes the initial response and critique to produce a revised confidence estimate and uncertainty breakdown.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse range of tasks from existing datasets, including:\n- Open-ended question answering: Use a subset of the TriviaQA dataset\n- Analytical reasoning: Use a subset of the LSAT Logical Reasoning dataset\n- Factual knowledge: Use a subset of the Natural Questions dataset",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score\n2. Simple reflection: Ask the model to answer, then reflect on its answer and provide a confidence score",
            "Step 3: Two-Stage Self-Critique Implementation": "Implement the proposed method:\n1. Initial response: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide an initial confidence score\n2. Self-critique: Prompt the model to critically analyze its initial response, identifying potential flaws or weaknesses\n3. Synthesis: Prompt the model to revise its confidence estimate and provide an uncertainty breakdown based on the critique",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from the OpenAI API for all experiments",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task and method:\n1. Generate responses and confidence estimates for all questions in the dataset\n2. Record the model's outputs, including initial responses, critiques, and final confidence estimates",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess the performance of each method using the following metrics:\n1. Accuracy: Compare model outputs to ground truth answers\n2. Calibration: Use Brier score and calibration curves to evaluate the reliability of confidence estimates\n3. Uncertainty quality: Manually assess a subset of responses to evaluate the quality and relevance of identified sources of uncertainty",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines across different task types\n2. Analyze the types of flaws and weaknesses identified in the self-critique stage\n3. Evaluate the impact of the self-critique on final confidence estimates and uncertainty breakdowns"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1: Baseline Method Failure": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Direct Prompting Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95%",
                "Simple Reflection Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. After reflecting on my answer, I remain highly confident in its accuracy. Confidence: 98%",
                "Explanation": "Both baseline methods demonstrate high confidence without identifying potential sources of uncertainty or considering alternative interpretations."
            },
            "Example 2: Proposed Method Success": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Stage 1 Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Initial confidence: 95%",
                "Stage 2 Output": "Critique: While I'm highly confident in this answer, there are a few potential sources of uncertainty to consider:\n1. Memory reliability: My knowledge comes from training data, which could potentially contain errors or outdated information.\n2. Alternative claims: There have been conspiracy theories suggesting the moon landing was faked, although these are not supported by scientific evidence.\n3. Definition of 'first': Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the moon shortly after Armstrong, so the distinction of 'first' depends on precise timing and definition.\n4. Potential unknown factors: There might be classified information or historical details I'm not aware of that could affect the accuracy of this statement.",
                "Final Output": "Revised answer: Based on the available evidence and historical records, Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. However, there are some sources of uncertainty to consider:\n1. Potential errors in historical records or training data (low probability)\n2. Alternative interpretations or conspiracy theories (very low probability)\n3. Precise definition of 'first' in relation to Buzz Aldrin's moon walk (negligible impact on the answer)\n4. Possibility of unknown classified information (very low probability)\n\nRevised confidence: 92%\nUncertainty breakdown:\n- Data reliability: 5%\n- Alternative interpretations: 2%\n- Definition precision: 1%\n- Unknown factors: 2%",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method identifies specific sources of uncertainty and provides a more nuanced confidence estimate, demonstrating improved calibration and uncertainty quantification."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed two-stage self-critique method does not significantly improve calibration or uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of the self-critiques generated by the model to gain insights into its reasoning processes and limitations. This could involve categorizing the types of critiques produced and examining their relevance and accuracy. Second, we could experiment with variations of the prompting strategy, such as providing more structured guidelines for self-critique or incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the prompts. Additionally, we could explore combining our method with other techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration post-processing, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, if the results suggest that the model's ability to self-critique is limited, we could shift focus to analyzing why this is the case and what it reveals about the current limitations of LLMs in meta-cognitive tasks."
