        "Problem": "LLMs often display overconfidence in their outputs, particularly when faced with subtle variations in input that could significantly alter the correct response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing calibration methods typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring counterfactual scenarios that are minimally different from the original query, we can probe the model's understanding of decision boundaries and potential alternative outcomes, leading to more nuanced confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Counterfactual Confidence Calibration (C4). Given an initial query and the model's response, C4 prompts the LLM to generate a set of minimally different counterfactual scenarios that would change the answer. The model is then asked to compare the original scenario with each counterfactual, explaining the key differences and their impact on the answer. Based on this analysis, the model generates a calibrated confidence score. This process encourages the model to consider edge cases and potential misunderstandings, leading to more robust uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate C4 on a range of tasks including factual QA, ethical reasoning, and scientific problem-solving. We'll compare it to standard confidence elicitation and calibration methods, focusing on metrics like expected calibration error and performance on adversarial examples designed to test the limits of the model's understanding."

        "Title": "Contrastive Counterfactual Confidence Calibration (C4): Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence in their outputs, particularly when faced with subtle variations in input that could significantly alter the correct response. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications and hinder the safe deployment of LLMs in real-world scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration of model outputs, which may not fully capture the nuanced understanding required for robust uncertainty quantification. By exploring counterfactual scenarios that are minimally different from the original query, we can probe the model's understanding of decision boundaries and potential alternative outcomes, leading to more nuanced confidence estimates. This approach leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to generate and analyze counterfactuals, potentially offering a more comprehensive and context-aware method of uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Counterfactual Confidence Calibration (C4), a novel prompting method for improving uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The C4 method consists of the following steps: 1) Given an initial query and the model's response, prompt the LLM to generate a set of minimally different counterfactual scenarios that would change the answer. 2) Ask the model to compare the original scenario with each counterfactual, explaining the key differences and their impact on the answer. 3) Based on this analysis, prompt the model to generate a calibrated confidence score. This process encourages the model to consider edge cases and potential misunderstandings, leading to more robust uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate C4: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MoralQA for ethical reasoning, and 3) ScienceQA for scientific problem-solving. These datasets cover a range of domains and reasoning types.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each query. b) Temperature scaling: Apply post-hoc calibration using temperature scaling on the model's logits. c) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use multiple forward passes with different random seeds and calculate the variance of the outputs.",
            "Step 3: C4 Method Implementation": "Implement the C4 method with the following prompts: a) Counterfactual generation: 'Generate 3 minimally different scenarios where the answer to the original question would change.' b) Comparative analysis: 'For each counterfactual scenario, explain the key differences from the original and how they impact the answer.' c) Confidence calibration: 'Based on your analysis of the original scenario and the counterfactuals, provide a calibrated confidence score (0-100%) for your original answer.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of C4 and the baselines: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between confidence and accuracy. b) Brier Score: Assesses the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): Evaluates the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect their confidence scores and predictions. b) Apply the C4 method and collect the generated counterfactuals, comparative analyses, and calibrated confidence scores. c) Calculate the evaluation metrics for both the baselines and C4.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of C4 against the baselines across all datasets and models. b) Analyze the generated counterfactuals and comparative analyses to gain insights into the model's reasoning process. c) Investigate cases where C4 significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines. d) Examine the relationship between the number and quality of generated counterfactuals and the final calibrated confidence scores."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1: Baseline Method Failure": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. I am 100% confident in my answer.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method of direct confidence elicitation shows overconfidence, as the model expresses 100% certainty without considering potential uncertainties or alternative interpretations."
            },
            "Example 2: C4 Method Success": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Step 1 - Counterfactual Generation": "1. What if Buzz Aldrin had exited the lunar module first instead of Neil Armstrong?\n2. What if the Soviet Union had succeeded in landing a cosmonaut on the moon before the Apollo 11 mission?\n3. What if there were conflicting historical accounts about who actually stepped onto the lunar surface first?",
                "Step 2 - Comparative Analysis": "1. If Buzz Aldrin had exited first, he would have been the first person on the moon. This highlights the importance of the specific sequence of events during the Apollo 11 mission.\n2. If the Soviet Union had landed a cosmonaut first, they would have claimed the title of first person on the moon. This emphasizes the competitive nature of the space race and how historical outcomes could have been different.\n3. Conflicting accounts would introduce uncertainty about who was actually first. This scenario reminds us that historical records can sometimes be subject to interpretation or dispute.",
                "Step 3 - Calibrated Confidence": "Based on the analysis of the original scenario and the counterfactuals, I would provide a calibrated confidence score of 95% for my original answer that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. While the historical record strongly supports this claim, the counterfactuals highlight that there could be some small degree of uncertainty or potential for alternative interpretations.",
                "Explanation": "The C4 method demonstrates a more nuanced approach to confidence calibration. By considering counterfactuals and analyzing their implications, the model provides a high but not absolute confidence score, acknowledging the potential for uncertainty in historical records or alternative scenarios."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the C4 method does not show significant improvements over the baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand the limitations of our approach. This analysis will focus on: 1) The quality and relevance of generated counterfactuals, 2) The model's ability to perform meaningful comparative analyses, and 3) The effectiveness of translating these analyses into calibrated confidence scores. Based on these insights, we may explore modifications to our method, such as: a) Refining the prompts to generate more diverse or relevant counterfactuals, b) Incorporating a meta-learning step where the model learns to improve its calibration based on feedback from a held-out validation set, or c) Combining C4 with other calibration techniques in an ensemble approach. Additionally, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of how different types of counterfactuals impact model confidence across various tasks and domains, potentially uncovering valuable insights about LLM reasoning and uncertainty."
