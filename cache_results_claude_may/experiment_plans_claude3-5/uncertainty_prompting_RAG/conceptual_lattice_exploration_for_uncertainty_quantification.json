        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to capture the nuanced relationships between concepts, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or statistical sampling methods, which may not fully leverage the model's conceptual understanding.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring the relationships between concepts in a structured manner, we can better assess the model's true understanding and uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Conceptual Lattice Exploration (CLE), a novel prompting method that constructs and traverses a lattice of related concepts to quantify uncertainty. Given a query, CLE first prompts the model to generate a set of related concepts, forming the nodes of the lattice. The model then establishes relationships between these concepts (e.g., 'is-a', 'part-of'), creating the edges of the lattice. CLE traverses this lattice, prompting the model to answer questions at each node and edge. The consistency and coherence of answers across the lattice are used to compute a robust uncertainty estimate. The final prompt integrates the original query, the conceptual lattice, and the derived uncertainty measure to elicit a well-calibrated response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CLE against baseline methods on both factual QA tasks (e.g., TriviaQA) and more abstract reasoning tasks (e.g., philosophical questions from PhilPapers). Evaluate using standard calibration metrics and introduce new metrics to assess conceptual consistency. Conduct user studies to evaluate the interpretability of the uncertainty estimates derived from the conceptual lattice."

        "Title": "Conceptual Lattice Exploration: A Novel Prompting Method for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the nuanced relationships between concepts, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty assessment is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or statistical sampling methods, which may not fully leverage the model's conceptual understanding. By exploring the relationships between concepts in a structured manner, we can better assess the model's true understanding and uncertainty. The Conceptual Lattice Exploration (CLE) method is inspired by cognitive science theories of conceptual networks and aims to leverage the LLM's ability to reason about relationships between ideas to produce more robust uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Conceptual Lattice Exploration (CLE), a novel prompting method that constructs and traverses a lattice of related concepts to quantify uncertainty. Given a query, CLE first prompts the model to generate a set of related concepts, forming the nodes of the lattice. The model then establishes relationships between these concepts (e.g., 'is-a', 'part-of'), creating the edges of the lattice.

The consistency and coherence of answers across the lattice are used to compute a robust uncertainty estimate. The final prompt integrates the original query, the conceptual lattice, and the derived uncertainty measure to elicit a well-calibrated response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: TriviaQA for factual QA tasks and a subset of philosophical questions from PhilPapers for abstract reasoning tasks. Preprocess these datasets to ensure compatibility with our prompting format.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. (2) Monte Carlo Dropout: perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CLE Implementation": "Implement the CLE method with the following sub-steps: (a) Concept Generation: Prompt the model to generate related concepts for the given query. (b) Relationship Establishment: Prompt the model to establish relationships between the generated concepts. (c) Lattice Traversal: Generate questions for each node and edge in the lattice. (d) Answer Generation: Obtain answers for each question in the lattice. (e) Uncertainty Estimation: Compute uncertainty based on the consistency and coherence of answers across the lattice.",
            "Step 4: Prompts Design": "Design prompts for each step of the CLE method. For example: (a) Concept Generation: 'Given the question \"{question}\", generate a list of 5 related concepts.' (b) Relationship Establishment: 'For the concepts {concept1} and {concept2}, describe their relationship (e.g., 'is-a', 'part-of', etc.).' (c) Lattice Traversal: 'Generate a question that relates {concept} to the original question: \"{question}\".' (d) Answer Generation: 'Answer the following question: {lattice_question}' (e) Final Response: 'Given the original question \"{question}\" and the conceptual lattice exploration results {lattice_results}, provide a final answer with a calibrated uncertainty estimate.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments, as it represents the current state-of-the-art in large language models.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. (2) Brier score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds. (4) Conceptual Consistency Score: a new metric to assess the coherence of answers across the conceptual lattice.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on both TriviaQA and PhilPapers datasets using the baseline methods and CLE. Collect results including model outputs, confidence scores, and lattice structures for CLE.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CLE against baseline methods using the defined evaluation metrics. Analyze the impact of lattice size and structure on uncertainty estimates. Investigate cases where CLE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 9: User Study": "Conduct a small-scale user study with 20 participants to evaluate the interpretability of uncertainty estimates derived from the conceptual lattice. Present participants with example outputs from both baseline methods and CLE, and ask them to rate the clarity and usefulness of the uncertainty information."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a direct answer with a confidence score, but doesn't offer insight into the reasoning process or potential sources of uncertainty."
            },
            "CLE Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "Conceptual Lattice:\n1. France (Country)\n2. Capital cities (Concept)\n3. European geography (Topic)\n4. French history (Topic)\n5. Government structures (Concept)\n\nRelationships:\n- France is-a Country\n- Capital cities part-of Countries\n- France part-of European geography\n- French history relates-to France\n- Government structures include Capital cities\n\nLattice Questions and Answers:\n1. What is the largest city in France? A: Paris\n2. Which city houses the French government? A: Paris\n3. What was the capital of France during the French Revolution? A: Paris\n4. Name a famous landmark in France's capital. A: Eiffel Tower\n5. How long has the current capital been the seat of French government? A: Since the Middle Ages\n\nFinal Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98%\n\nUncertainty Estimate: Very Low (0.02)\nReasoning: The conceptual lattice exploration consistently points to Paris as the capital of France across multiple related concepts and historical periods. The high consistency in the answers and the presence of specific details (e.g., Eiffel Tower, historical context) contribute to a very low uncertainty estimate.",
                "Explanation": "CLE provides a more comprehensive exploration of the concept, offering insights into related ideas and cross-validating the answer through multiple perspectives. This approach allows for a more nuanced and justified uncertainty estimate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CLE method doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed analysis to understand the limitations. This analysis will focus on: (1) The quality and relevance of generated concepts in the lattice. (2) The accuracy of established relationships between concepts. (3) The consistency of answers across the lattice. Based on these findings, we may refine the CLE method by implementing a hierarchical concept generation process, where we first generate high-level concepts and then drill down into more specific ones. Additionally, we could explore incorporating external knowledge bases to validate the generated concepts and relationships. If these refinements don't yield significant improvements, we will pivot the project towards an analysis paper. This paper would focus on the challenges of using conceptual structures for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, providing insights into the model's reasoning processes and the limitations of current prompting techniques for complex tasks."
