    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex, multi-faceted questions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-step confidence estimation or basic ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems to better assess their overall uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Fractal Uncertainty Elicitation, a novel prompting technique that recursively decomposes a given question into increasingly granular sub-questions. The LLM is prompted to estimate its confidence for each sub-question, and these estimates are then aggregated using a bottom-up approach. The prompts are designed to guide the model through this fractal-like decomposition, ensuring that each level of granularity is explored. For example, given a complex question about climate change, the model might first break it down into sub-questions about greenhouse gases, ocean currents, and atmospheric patterns, then further decompose each of these into more specific queries. This fractal approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive uncertainty assessment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare Fractal Uncertainty Elicitation against standard confidence estimation techniques on a range of complex, multi-domain questions. Evaluate using calibration metrics and expert human judgments of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Fractal Uncertainty Elicitation: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models through Recursive Decomposition",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex, multi-faceted questions. This leads to overconfidence in incorrect answers and underconfidence in correct ones, potentially misleading users and reducing the reliability of these models in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-step confidence estimation or basic ensemble methods, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of complex queries. Human experts often break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems to better assess their overall uncertainty. By mimicking this approach, we can potentially improve the calibration of LLMs' confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Fractal Uncertainty Elicitation (FUE), a novel prompting technique that recursively decomposes a given question into increasingly granular sub-questions. The LLM is prompted to estimate its confidence for each sub-question, and these estimates are then aggregated using a bottom-up approach. The prompts are designed to guide the model through this fractal-like decomposition, ensuring that each level of granularity is explored. For example, given a complex question about climate change, the model might first break it down into sub-questions about greenhouse gases, ocean currents, and atmospheric patterns, then further decompose each of these into more specific queries. This fractal approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive uncertainty assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of complex, multi-domain questions from datasets such as TruthfulQA, ARC-Challenge, and MultiArith. We will also create a custom dataset of 100 multi-faceted questions spanning various domains (e.g., science, history, current events) to specifically test the effectiveness of our method on highly complex queries.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques: (a) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. (b) Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to generate an ensemble of answers and derive confidence from agreement.",
            "Step 3: FUE Implementation": "Develop the Fractal Uncertainty Elicitation method: (a) Create a prompt template for question decomposition. (b) Implement the recursive decomposition algorithm. (c) Design the confidence aggregation method.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in our datasets: (a) Apply baseline methods to get confidence estimates. (b) Apply FUE method to get decomposed confidence estimates. (c) Record the model's answers, confidence scores, and the actual correctness of the answers.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: (a) Calibration plots: Plot predicted confidence vs. actual accuracy. (b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. (c) Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (d) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): Evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis: (a) Compare FUE performance against baselines across different question types and domains. (b) Analyze the structure of decompositions generated by FUE. (c) Investigate how decomposition depth affects confidence calibration. (d) Examine cases where FUE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What are the potential long-term effects of rising sea levels on coastal ecosystems and human settlements? Provide an answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Rising sea levels can have several long-term effects on coastal ecosystems and human settlements:\n\n1. Coastal erosion: Increased water levels can accelerate erosion of shorelines, leading to loss of land and habitat.\n2. Saltwater intrusion: As sea levels rise, saltwater can infiltrate freshwater aquifers, affecting drinking water supplies and agriculture.\n3. Flooding: More frequent and severe flooding events can damage infrastructure and displace communities.\n4. Habitat loss: Many coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands and mangroves, may be submerged, leading to loss of biodiversity.\n5. Economic impacts: Tourism, fishing, and other coastal industries may be negatively affected.\n6. Forced migration: Some coastal communities may need to relocate entirely, leading to social and economic challenges.\n\nConfidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FUE Step 1: Initial Decomposition)": "Q: What are the potential long-term effects of rising sea levels on coastal ecosystems and human settlements? To answer this complex question, let's break it down into smaller, more manageable sub-questions. Please provide 3-5 sub-questions that, when answered, would help address the main question comprehensively.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FUE Step 1: Initial Decomposition)": "1. How do rising sea levels impact coastal erosion and shoreline changes?\n2. What are the effects of saltwater intrusion on coastal freshwater systems and agriculture?\n3. How do rising sea levels affect the frequency and severity of coastal flooding?\n4. What are the consequences of sea level rise for coastal ecosystems, including wetlands and marine habitats?\n5. How do rising sea levels impact human settlements, infrastructure, and economic activities in coastal areas?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FUE Step 2: Sub-question Confidence Estimation)": "For each sub-question, provide a brief answer and your confidence level (0-100%) in that answer:\n\n1. How do rising sea levels impact coastal erosion and shoreline changes?\n2. What are the effects of saltwater intrusion on coastal freshwater systems and agriculture?\n3. How do rising sea levels affect the frequency and severity of coastal flooding?\n4. What are the consequences of sea level rise for coastal ecosystems, including wetlands and marine habitats?\n5. How do rising sea levels impact human settlements, infrastructure, and economic activities in coastal areas?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FUE Step 2: Sub-question Confidence Estimation)": "1. Rising sea levels accelerate coastal erosion by increasing wave energy and water depth, leading to more frequent and severe shoreline retreat. Confidence: 90%\n\n2. Saltwater intrusion contaminates freshwater aquifers, making water unsuitable for drinking and irrigation, and can lead to soil salinization, reducing agricultural productivity. Confidence: 85%\n\n3. Rising sea levels increase the baseline for storm surges and high tides, leading to more frequent and extensive coastal flooding events. Confidence: 95%\n\n4. Sea level rise can submerge coastal wetlands and alter marine habitats, leading to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Some ecosystems may migrate inland, while others may disappear. Confidence: 80%\n\n5. Rising seas threaten coastal infrastructure, homes, and businesses, potentially forcing relocation of communities and causing significant economic losses in tourism, fishing, and other coastal industries. Confidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FUE Step 3: Confidence Aggregation)": "Based on the confidence levels provided for each sub-question, calculate an overall confidence level for the main question: 'What are the potential long-term effects of rising sea levels on coastal ecosystems and human settlements?' Explain your reasoning for the aggregation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FUE Step 3: Confidence Aggregation)": "Overall Confidence: 87%\n\nReasoning for aggregation:\n1. I calculated the average of the individual confidence scores: (90 + 85 + 95 + 80 + 85) / 5 = 87%\n2. The confidence levels for the sub-questions are relatively consistent, ranging from 80% to 95%, which suggests a good overall understanding of the topic.\n3. The highest confidence (95%) is in the fundamental mechanism of increased flooding, which is a key driver of many other effects.\n4. The lowest confidence (80%) is in the specific consequences for ecosystems, which are indeed more complex and variable.\n5. The other aspects (erosion, saltwater intrusion, and human impacts) have similar confidence levels around 85-90%, indicating a solid grasp of these issues.\n\nGiven the comprehensive coverage of the sub-questions and the relatively high confidence in each, an overall confidence of 87% seems appropriate. This reflects a strong understanding of the major effects of sea level rise, while acknowledging some uncertainty in the complex interactions and long-term consequences.",
            "explanation": "The FUE method provides a more nuanced and justified confidence estimation compared to the baseline. By breaking down the complex question into sub-components, it allows for a more detailed assessment of the model's knowledge and uncertainties in different aspects of the problem. The final aggregation step provides a well-reasoned overall confidence level, taking into account the varying confidences in different sub-aspects of the question."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the Fractal Uncertainty Elicitation method does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot our research in several directions: 1) Analyze the decomposition patterns to understand how LLMs break down complex questions and whether this process itself provides insights into model reasoning. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from FUE, which could lead to a hybrid approach combining FUE with other methods. 3) Explore how the depth of decomposition affects performance, potentially revealing an optimal decomposition strategy. 4) Examine cases where FUE performs poorly to identify potential improvements or limitations of the method. 5) Consider using the decomposition process as a form of explanation generation, shifting the focus from confidence calibration to interpretability of model outputs. These alternative directions could still yield valuable insights into LLM behavior and uncertainty quantification, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
