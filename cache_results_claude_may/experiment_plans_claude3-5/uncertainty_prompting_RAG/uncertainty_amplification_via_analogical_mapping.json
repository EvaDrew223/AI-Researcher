        "Title": "Uncertainty Amplification via Analogical Mapping (UAAM): Improving LLM Confidence Calibration through Cognitive-Inspired Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their uncertainty when dealing with novel or out-of-distribution problems, leading to overconfident predictions on unfamiliar tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically rely on direct prompting or fine-tuning on uncertainty estimation tasks. However, these methods may not effectively capture the nuanced ways humans assess their own uncertainty, particularly in novel situations. Humans often gauge their uncertainty by drawing analogies to familiar situations, allowing them to decompose unfamiliar problems into more relatable components. By leveraging this cognitive strategy, we aim to improve LLMs' uncertainty quantification, especially for out-of-distribution tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Amplification via Analogical Mapping (UAAM), a prompting procedure that guides LLMs to assess their uncertainty through analogical reasoning. The method consists of five key steps: 1) Present the target problem. 2) Instruct the model to generate analogous problems with varying levels of difficulty and familiarity. 3) For each analogy, prompt the model to solve it and provide a confidence score. 4) Guide the model to map uncertainties from the analogous problems back to the original problem. 5) Synthesize these mapped uncertainties to produce a final confidence estimate for the target problem.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use out-of-distribution tasks derived from established benchmarks like BIG-bench and MMLU. Specifically, we'll select a subset of tasks from these datasets that are likely to be challenging for LLMs, such as interdisciplinary questions or those requiring specialized knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation techniques as baselines: a) Direct prompting: Ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score directly. b) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to generate multiple outputs and estimate uncertainty. c) Ensemble methods: Use multiple model instances or different prompts to generate an ensemble of predictions.",
            "Step 3: UAAM Implementation": "Implement the UAAM method with the following prompts: a) Initial prompt: 'Given the following question, generate three analogous problems with varying levels of difficulty: [QUESTION]' b) Analogy solving prompt: 'Solve the following analogous problem and provide a confidence score (0-100): [ANALOGOUS_PROBLEM]' c) Uncertainty mapping prompt: 'Based on your solutions and confidence scores for the analogous problems, map the uncertainties back to the original problem: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION]' d) Final synthesis prompt: 'Synthesize the mapped uncertainties to produce a final confidence estimate (0-100) for the original problem: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of UAAM against the baseline methods using the following metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Assesses the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) AUC-ROC for detecting correct vs. incorrect predictions: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: a) Compare UAAM performance against baselines across different task types. b) Analyze the quality and relevance of generated analogies. c) Investigate how the number and diversity of analogies affect performance. d) Examine cases where UAAM significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: In quantum mechanics, what is the relationship between the wavelength of a particle and its momentum? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: In quantum mechanics, the relationship between the wavelength (\u03bb) of a particle and its momentum (p) is given by the de Broglie equation: \u03bb = h / p, where h is Planck's constant. This equation states that the wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its momentum. Confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAAM; Step 1: Generate Analogies)": "Q: In quantum mechanics, what is the relationship between the wavelength of a particle and its momentum? Generate three analogous problems with varying levels of difficulty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAAM; Step 1: Generate Analogies)": "1. Easy: What is the relationship between the frequency and wavelength of a wave in classical physics?\n2. Medium: How does the energy of a photon relate to its frequency in quantum mechanics?\n3. Difficult: In special relativity, what is the relationship between a particle's rest mass and its momentum?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAAM; Step 2: Solve Analogies)": "Solve the following analogous problem and provide a confidence score (0-100): What is the relationship between the frequency and wavelength of a wave in classical physics?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAAM; Step 2: Solve Analogies)": "A: In classical physics, the relationship between the frequency (f) and wavelength (\u03bb) of a wave is given by the equation: c = f * \u03bb, where c is the speed of the wave. This means that the frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to each other. As the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases, and vice versa. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAAM; Step 3: Map Uncertainties)": "Based on your solutions and confidence scores for the analogous problems, map the uncertainties back to the original problem: In quantum mechanics, what is the relationship between the wavelength of a particle and its momentum?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAAM; Step 3: Map Uncertainties)": "The original question about the relationship between wavelength and momentum in quantum mechanics is most similar to the easy analogy about frequency and wavelength in classical physics. Both involve inverse relationships between two properties of waves or particles. However, the quantum mechanics context adds complexity and uncertainty. The medium difficulty analogy about photon energy and frequency is also relevant, as it involves quantum mechanics concepts. The difficult analogy about rest mass and momentum in special relativity is less directly applicable but highlights the complexity of particle behavior at high energies. Based on these mappings, I estimate my uncertainty for the original question to be slightly higher than for the classical physics analogy, but lower than for the special relativity analogy.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAAM; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Synthesize the mapped uncertainties to produce a final confidence estimate (0-100) for the original problem: In quantum mechanics, what is the relationship between the wavelength of a particle and its momentum?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAAM; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final confidence estimate: 88. This confidence score is based on the strong similarity to the classical wave equation (which I'm very confident about), tempered by the added complexity of quantum mechanics. The relevance of the photon energy-frequency relationship in quantum mechanics adds support to this confidence level. While the special relativity analogy introduces some uncertainty, its lower relevance to this specific question doesn't significantly impact the overall confidence.",
            "Explanation": "UAAM allows the model to decompose the complex quantum mechanics question into more familiar analogies, enabling a more nuanced assessment of uncertainty. By considering multiple related concepts and their associated confidence levels, the model can provide a more calibrated final confidence estimate compared to direct prompting, which may be prone to overconfidence on specialized topics."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UAAM does not significantly improve uncertainty estimation compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated analogies to understand why they may not be effectively capturing uncertainty. This could involve categorizing the types of analogies generated and their relevance to the original problems. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from UAAM than others, potentially leading to insights about when analogical reasoning is most effective for uncertainty estimation. 3) Explore variations of the UAAM method, such as adjusting the number of analogies generated or incorporating a meta-learning step where the model learns to weight different analogies based on their relevance. 4) Combine UAAM with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. 5) Shift focus to analyzing how LLMs reason about uncertainty across different domains, using the analogies generated by UAAM as a window into the model's internal representations and reasoning processes."
