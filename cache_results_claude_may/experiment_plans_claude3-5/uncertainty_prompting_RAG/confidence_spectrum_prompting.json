    "idea_name": "Confidence Spectrum Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty across a wide range of confidence levels, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in different scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use binary confidence estimation or coarse-grained confidence buckets.",
        "Motivation": "Humans naturally express confidence along a continuous spectrum. By prompting LLMs to generate responses across the full confidence spectrum, we can better calibrate their uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Prompting, which involves a two-stage process: 1) Spectrum Generation: For a given query, prompt the LLM to generate multiple responses spanning the full confidence spectrum (e.g., 'Generate 10 responses to this query, ranging from 0% confidence to 100% confidence in 10% increments'). 2) Calibration: Use these spectrum responses to calibrate the model's final confidence estimate by comparing the original response to the spectrum responses and interpolating its position.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on diverse question-answering datasets, comparing against standard confidence estimation methods. Measure calibration using metrics like Expected Calibration Error and analyze the model's ability to express fine-grained uncertainty levels."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Prompting: Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty across a wide range of confidence levels, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in different scenarios. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and poor decision-making when these models are used in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically use binary confidence estimation or coarse-grained confidence buckets, which fail to capture the nuanced spectrum of uncertainty that humans naturally express. By prompting LLMs to generate responses across the full confidence spectrum, we can better calibrate their uncertainty estimates and improve their overall reliability. This method leverages the model's own capabilities to generate a range of responses, potentially offering a more accurate representation of its true confidence levels without requiring additional training or external calibration techniques.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Prompting (CSP), a two-stage process: 1) Spectrum Generation: For a given query, prompt the LLM to generate multiple responses spanning the full confidence spectrum (e.g., 'Generate 10 responses to this query, ranging from 0% confidence to 100% confidence in 10% increments'). 2) Calibration: Use these spectrum responses to calibrate the model's final confidence estimate by comparing the original response to the spectrum responses and interpolating its position.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of topics and difficulty levels. We will use: a) TriviaQA for general knowledge, b) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension with unanswerable questions, and c) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting with confidence request, b) Temperature scaling, c) Monte Carlo Dropout (if applicable to the chosen model).",
            "Step 3: Confidence Spectrum Prompting Implementation": "Develop prompts for generating the confidence spectrum. Example prompt: 'Please provide 10 different answers to the following question, each with a different level of confidence ranging from 0% to 100% in 10% increments. Start with 0% confidence and end with 100% confidence. Question: [INSERT QUESTION HERE]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Choose large language models for evaluation. We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods, b) Apply Confidence Spectrum Prompting, c) For CSP, implement the calibration step by comparing the original model response to the spectrum responses and interpolating its position.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Measure calibration using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. Also, analyze the model's ability to express fine-grained uncertainty levels by examining the distribution of confidence estimates across the spectrum.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CSP against baseline methods. Analyze how well the model distinguishes between different confidence levels and whether it improves overall calibration. Examine cases where CSP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level from 0% to 100%.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%"
            },
            "CSP Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide 10 different answers, each with a different level of confidence ranging from 0% to 100% in 10% increments. Start with 0% confidence and end with 100% confidence.",
                "Output": "0% confidence: I have no idea what the capital of France is.\n10% confidence: Maybe it's London, but I'm extremely unsure.\n20% confidence: It could be Berlin, but that's probably wrong.\n30% confidence: I think it might be Rome, but I'm quite uncertain.\n40% confidence: There's a chance it's Madrid, but I'm not very confident.\n50% confidence: It's either Paris or Lyon, I'm not sure which.\n60% confidence: I believe it's Paris, but I'm not entirely certain.\n70% confidence: I'm fairly sure the capital of France is Paris.\n80% confidence: Paris is most likely the capital of France.\n90% confidence: I'm very confident that Paris is the capital of France.\n100% confidence: The capital of France is definitely Paris.",
                "Explanation": "The CSP method allows the model to express a range of confidence levels, providing a more nuanced view of its uncertainty. This can help in better calibrating the model's confidence estimates compared to the baseline method, which only provides a single point estimate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Confidence Spectrum Prompting method doesn't significantly improve calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the generated spectrum responses to understand why they don't lead to better calibration. This might involve examining the linguistic patterns or content differences across confidence levels. Second, we could explore combining CSP with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Third, we could investigate whether CSP performs differently across various types of questions or domains, potentially uncovering insights about when and why LLMs express uncertainty more or less accurately. Finally, we could shift focus to use CSP as a tool for analyzing and visualizing LLM uncertainty, even if it doesn't directly improve calibration, which could provide valuable insights into model behavior and limitations."
