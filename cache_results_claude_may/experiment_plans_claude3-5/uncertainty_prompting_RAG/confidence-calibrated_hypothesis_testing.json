        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when faced with ambiguous or incomplete information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling or ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Scientific hypothesis testing provides a structured framework for evaluating evidence and quantifying uncertainty. Adapting this approach for LLMs could lead to more calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting strategy that guides the LLM through a hypothesis testing process: 1) Formulate multiple hypotheses for the given query. 2) For each hypothesis, generate potential evidence that would support or refute it. 3) Evaluate the strength of available evidence for each hypothesis. 4) Assign confidence levels to each hypothesis based on evidence strength. 5) Synthesize a final answer with a calibrated confidence score. This method encourages the model to consider alternative explanations and weigh evidence systematically before committing to an answer.",

        "Title": "Hypothesis Testing Prompting for Calibrated Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when faced with ambiguous or incomplete information. This leads to overconfident predictions on uncertain inputs and poor calibration of confidence estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like temperature scaling or ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks. Scientific hypothesis testing provides a structured framework for evaluating evidence and quantifying uncertainty. Adapting this approach for LLMs could lead to more calibrated confidence estimates by encouraging systematic consideration of alternative explanations and evidence evaluation before committing to an answer.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting strategy that guides the LLM through a hypothesis testing process: 1) Formulate multiple hypotheses for the given query. 2) For each hypothesis, generate potential evidence that would support or refute it. 3) Evaluate the strength of available evidence for each hypothesis. 4) Assign confidence levels to each hypothesis based on evidence strength. 5) Synthesize a final answer with a calibrated confidence score. This method encourages the model to consider alternative explanations and weigh evidence systematically before committing to an answer.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset for factual question answering and the SciQ dataset for scientific reasoning. These datasets contain questions with varying levels of difficulty and ambiguity, making them suitable for evaluating uncertainty quantification.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement the following baselines: a) Standard few-shot prompting b) Temperature scaling c) Ensemble method (using different few-shot exemplars)",
            "Step 3: Hypothesis Testing Prompting": "Implement our proposed method with the following steps: a) Hypothesis generation: Prompt the model to generate 2-3 plausible hypotheses for each question. b) Evidence generation: For each hypothesis, prompt the model to list potential supporting and refuting evidence. c) Evidence evaluation: Prompt the model to rate the strength of each piece of evidence on a scale of 1-5. d) Confidence assignment: Based on the evidence evaluation, prompt the model to assign a confidence score (0-100%) to each hypothesis. e) Final answer synthesis: Prompt the model to provide a final answer and overall confidence score based on the hypothesis testing process.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance: a) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between confidence and accuracy c) Brier score: Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions d) Confidence-accuracy plots: Visualize the relationship between model confidence and accuracy",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect predictions with confidence scores b) Run our hypothesis testing prompting method and collect predictions with confidence scores c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and proposed methods d) Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-test) to compare the performance of our method against baselines",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of our method against baselines across different question types and difficulty levels b) Analyze the generated hypotheses and evidence to understand how they contribute to improved calibration c) Investigate cases where our method significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines d) Examine the relationship between the number of hypotheses considered and calibration performance"

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Final Answer Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nOverall Confidence: 95%\n\nExplanation: The hypothesis testing process strongly supports Neil Armstrong as the first person to walk on the moon. This is backed by extensive historical records, NASA official statements, and Armstrong's famous quote. While alternative hypotheses were considered, the evidence supporting them is much weaker, and there is strong refuting evidence for both Buzz Aldrin and Yuri Gagarin being the first. The high confidence score reflects the overwhelming evidence in favor of Neil Armstrong, with only a small margin of uncertainty due to the existence of some (albeit weak) contrary claims.",
            "Explanation": "The hypothesis testing prompting method encourages the model to consider multiple possibilities, systematically evaluate evidence, and assign calibrated confidence scores. This process leads to a more nuanced and well-supported final answer compared to the baseline method, which might produce overconfident responses without considering alternative explanations or weighing evidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed hypothesis testing prompting method does not significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can explore several alternative directions: 1) Analyze the generated hypotheses and evidence to understand if the model is struggling with generating diverse hypotheses or accurately evaluating evidence. This could lead to refinements in our prompting strategy or the development of a multi-step prompting approach that breaks down these tasks further. 2) Investigate whether the performance varies across different types of questions or domains, which could inform a more targeted application of the method. 3) Experiment with varying the number of hypotheses generated or the granularity of the evidence evaluation scale to find an optimal balance between thoroughness and efficiency. 4) Combine our method with existing calibration techniques like temperature scaling or ensemble methods to see if there are complementary benefits. 5) If the method shows promise in certain areas but not others, we could pivot to a more focused study on understanding when and why hypothesis testing prompting is most effective for uncertainty quantification in LLMs."
