        "Problem": "Language models often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when answering questions about events or facts that span different time scales, leading to unreliable uncertainty quantification for temporal reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in language models typically do not explicitly account for temporal consistency across different time scales.",
        "Motivation": "By probing the model's confidence across multiple time scales and checking for consistency, we can obtain a more robust estimate of the model's true uncertainty, especially for questions involving temporal reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Consistency Probing (MSTCP), a prompting technique that evaluates the model's confidence across various time granularities. The process involves: 1) For a given question, generate a set of temporally related questions at different scales (e.g., days, months, years, decades), 2) Prompt the model to answer each question and provide a confidence score, 3) Analyze the consistency of answers and confidence scores across time scales, 4) Calculate a 'temporal consistency score' based on the agreement between different scales, 5) Adjust the final confidence estimate based on both the original score and the temporal consistency score. We also introduce a 'temporal robustness index' that quantifies how stable the model's confidence is across different time scales.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MSTCP on temporal reasoning datasets such as TimeQA and TempQuestions. We'll compare its performance against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods, using metrics like ECE and AURC. Additionally, we'll analyze how the temporal consistency scores correlate with actual model performance to validate the effectiveness of this approach."

        "Problem Statement": "Language models often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when answering questions about events or facts that span different time scales, leading to unreliable uncertainty quantification for temporal reasoning tasks. This inconsistency hinders the models' ability to accurately assess their own knowledge and limitations across various temporal contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty estimation in language models typically do not explicitly account for temporal consistency across different time scales. By probing the model's confidence across multiple time scales and checking for consistency, we can obtain a more robust estimate of the model's true uncertainty, especially for questions involving temporal reasoning. This method leverages the model's inherent capabilities to reason about time, potentially leading to more reliable uncertainty estimates without requiring additional training or external knowledge sources.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Consistency Probing (MSTCP), a prompting technique that evaluates the model's confidence across various time granularities.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use temporal reasoning datasets such as TimeQA and TempQuestions. Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets if not already done.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods as baselines. For standard prompting, we'll use a template like 'Q: {question} A: Let's approach this step-by-step: [Answer] How confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0 to 100?'",
            "Step 3: MSTCP Implementation": "Implement the MSTCP method: a) Create a function to generate temporally related questions at different scales. For example, if the original question is 'When did World War II end?', generate questions like 'In which month of 1945 did World War II end?', 'In which year of the 1940s did World War II end?', 'In which decade of the 20th century did World War II end?'. b) Implement a function to prompt the model with these questions and collect answers and confidence scores. c) Develop an algorithm to calculate the temporal consistency score based on the agreement of answers across scales. d) Implement the temporal robustness index calculation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Apply standard prompting and collect the answer and confidence score. b) Apply MSTCP and collect answers and confidence scores for all temporal scales. c) Calculate the temporal consistency score and temporal robustness index. d) Adjust the final confidence estimate using MSTCP results.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC). Compare the results of standard prompting and MSTCP.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze how the temporal consistency scores correlate with actual model performance. Investigate cases where MSTCP significantly improves or degrades performance compared to standard prompting."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: When did the construction of the Eiffel Tower begin? A: Let's approach this step-by-step: [Answer] How confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0 to 100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The construction of the Eiffel Tower began on January 28, 1887. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris.\n2. Construction typically begins well before such events to ensure completion.\n3. Historical records show that ground was broken for the tower on January 28, 1887.\n4. The construction took 2 years, 2 months, and 5 days to complete.\n5. The tower was inaugurated on March 31, 1889, in time for the World's Fair.\n\nConfidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MSTCP Step 1)": "Generate temporally related questions at different scales for the original question: 'When did the construction of the Eiffel Tower begin?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MSTCP Step 1)": "1. In which month of 1887 did the construction of the Eiffel Tower begin?\n2. In which year of the 1880s did the construction of the Eiffel Tower begin?\n3. In which decade of the 19th century did the construction of the Eiffel Tower begin?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MSTCP Step 2)": "Q: In which month of 1887 did the construction of the Eiffel Tower begin? A: Let's approach this step-by-step: [Answer] How confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0 to 100?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MSTCP Step 2)": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris.\n2. Construction typically begins well in advance of such events.\n3. Historical records indicate that the construction of the Eiffel Tower began in January 1887.\n4. Specifically, ground was broken for the tower on January 28, 1887.\n5. Therefore, the construction of the Eiffel Tower began in the month of January 1887.\n\nConfidence: 98",
            "Explanation": "The MSTCP method generates multiple temporally related questions at different scales, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of the model's knowledge and confidence across various time granularities. This approach helps identify potential inconsistencies in the model's temporal reasoning and provides a more robust uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MSTCP doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can analyze the patterns of temporal inconsistencies to gain insights into the model's reasoning process. We might discover that certain time scales or types of questions are particularly challenging for the model. This could lead to a focused analysis paper on the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models. Additionally, we could explore variations of MSTCP, such as incorporating domain-specific temporal knowledge or using different methods to aggregate confidence scores across time scales. Another direction could be to investigate how MSTCP performance varies across different types of temporal questions (e.g., point-in-time vs. duration questions) or different historical periods, which could provide valuable insights into the model's knowledge distribution and potential biases in temporal reasoning."
