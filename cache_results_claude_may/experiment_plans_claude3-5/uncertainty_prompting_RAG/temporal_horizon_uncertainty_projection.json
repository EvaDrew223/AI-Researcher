    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLM uncertainty quantification methods often fail to account for how confidence might change over time or with the acquisition of new information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide static uncertainty estimates without considering potential future knowledge states.",
        "Motivation": "Incorporating a temporal dimension into uncertainty estimation could provide more robust and forward-looking confidence measures, especially for time-sensitive or evolving scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Horizon Uncertainty Projection (THUP), a prompting technique that asks the LLM to project its uncertainty across multiple future time points or knowledge states. For a given query, the LLM is prompted to: 1) Estimate current confidence, 2) Identify key factors that could change over time, 3) Project confidence levels at several future time points, considering potential new information or changes, 4) Estimate the stability of its projections, and 5) Aggregate these projections into a dynamic uncertainty profile. This method produces not just a single uncertainty estimate, but a temporal curve of projected uncertainties.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate THUP against static uncertainty estimation methods on datasets involving time-sensitive information or evolving scenarios, such as financial forecasting tasks or scientific hypothesis testing. Measure performance using time-aware calibration metrics, and assess the method's ability to adapt uncertainty estimates as new information becomes available in a simulated online learning setting."

        "Title": "Temporal Horizon Uncertainty Projection: Calibrating LLM Confidence Across Time",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide static confidence estimates that fail to account for potential changes in knowledge or confidence over time. This limitation can lead to unreliable uncertainty estimates, especially in dynamic or evolving scenarios where new information may become available.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically offer point-in-time uncertainty estimates without considering how confidence might evolve with the acquisition of new information. By incorporating a temporal dimension into uncertainty estimation, we can provide more robust and forward-looking confidence measures. This is particularly crucial for time-sensitive applications or scenarios where the knowledge landscape is rapidly changing. Our proposed method, Temporal Horizon Uncertainty Projection (THUP), is inspired by human decision-making processes where we often consider how our confidence might change over time or with new information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Horizon Uncertainty Projection (THUP), a prompting technique that asks the LLM to project its uncertainty across multiple future time points or knowledge states. For a given query, THUP prompts the LLM to: 1) Estimate current confidence, 2) Identify key factors that could change over time, 3) Project confidence levels at several future time points, considering potential new information or changes, 4) Estimate the stability of its projections, and 5) Aggregate these projections into a dynamic uncertainty profile. This method produces not just a single uncertainty estimate, but a temporal curve of projected uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) Financial forecasting dataset (e.g., S&P 500 predictions), 2) Scientific hypothesis testing dataset (e.g., emerging scientific claims), and 3) News event prediction dataset (e.g., geopolitical events). For each dataset, we'll create a test set with ground truth outcomes at different time points (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Temperature scaling, 2) Ensemble disagreement, and 3) Monte Carlo Dropout. These will be applied to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models via the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 3: THUP Implementation": "Implement the THUP method using the following prompt structure for each query:\n'Given the following question: [QUESTION]\n1. Estimate your current confidence in answering this question (0-100%).\n2. Identify 3-5 key factors that could change your confidence over time.\n3. Project your confidence levels at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year from now, considering potential new information or changes.\n4. Estimate the stability of your projections (0-100%).\n5. Provide an overall uncertainty profile based on your projections.'",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and each method (baselines and THUP):\n1. Generate uncertainty estimates for all queries at each time point.\n2. For THUP, store the full uncertainty profiles.\n3. Record model outputs, uncertainty estimates, and computation time.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "1. Calculate calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, Brier Score) for each method at each time point.\n2. Compute a time-aware calibration metric that weighs the accuracy of predictions across different time horizons.\n3. Analyze the stability and consistency of uncertainty estimates over time.\n4. Compare the computational efficiency of THUP against baseline methods.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1. Compare THUP's performance against baselines across different time horizons.\n2. Analyze how THUP's uncertainty profiles evolve over time and correlate with actual outcomes.\n3. Investigate cases where THUP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\n4. Examine the key factors identified by THUP and their relevance to actual outcome changes."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What will be the price of Bitcoin in 6 months?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on current market trends and historical data, I estimate that the price of Bitcoin in 6 months could be around $50,000. However, please note that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and subject to many unpredictable factors, so this is just an educated guess with a confidence level of about 60%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "What will be the price of Bitcoin in 6 months? Please provide your answer using the Temporal Horizon Uncertainty Projection method.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Current confidence: 60%\n2. Key factors that could change confidence:\n   - Regulatory changes in major economies\n   - Technological advancements or setbacks in the crypto space\n   - Global economic conditions\n   - Adoption rates by institutions and countries\n   - Major security incidents or breaches\n3. Projected confidence levels:\n   - 1 week: 60%\n   - 1 month: 55%\n   - 3 months: 45%\n   - 6 months: 35%\n   - 1 year: 25%\n4. Stability of projections: 70%\n5. Overall uncertainty profile: My confidence in predicting Bitcoin's price decreases significantly over time, with a sharp drop after the 1-month mark. This reflects the increasing uncertainty due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets and the potential for unforeseen events to dramatically impact prices. The moderate stability score indicates that while the trend of decreasing confidence is likely to hold, the exact values may fluctuate.\n\nBased on this uncertainty profile, I estimate that the price of Bitcoin in 6 months could be around $50,000, but with a significantly lower confidence (35%) compared to my initial estimate. This projection accounts for the increasing uncertainty over time and the potential for major market-shifting events.",
            "Explanation": "The THUP method provides a more nuanced and time-aware uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline. It explicitly considers how confidence might change over time and identifies specific factors that could influence the prediction. This allows for a more informed interpretation of the forecast and highlights the increasing uncertainty as the time horizon extends."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If THUP does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of the key factors identified by THUP, 2) Analyzing how well THUP's projected confidence levels align with actual outcome probabilities, 3) Investigating whether certain types of queries or time horizons are particularly challenging for THUP. Based on these insights, we could explore modifications to the THUP prompt structure, such as incorporating domain-specific knowledge or adjusting the time horizons considered. Additionally, we could investigate combining THUP with other uncertainty estimation methods, creating an ensemble approach that leverages the strengths of multiple techniques. If these attempts still don't yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper, focusing on why temporal aspects of uncertainty are challenging for LLMs and what this reveals about their reasoning capabilities and limitations."
