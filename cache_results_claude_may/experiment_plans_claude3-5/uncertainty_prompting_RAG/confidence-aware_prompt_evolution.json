    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current prompting methods often struggle to accurately capture the nuanced uncertainty of language models across diverse tasks and domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on static prompts or simple confidence elicitation techniques that may not adapt well to different contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by evolutionary algorithms, we propose an adaptive prompting method that evolves and refines prompts to better calibrate confidence estimates across varying tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting pipeline: 1) Generate an initial population of diverse prompts for confidence elicitation. 2) Evaluate each prompt's effectiveness using a small calibration set. 3) Select top-performing prompts and create new ones through recombination and mutation operations. 4) Iterate steps 2-3 for multiple generations. 5) Use the final evolved prompt ensemble for confidence estimation on new inputs. The evolution process optimizes for prompts that yield well-calibrated confidence scores across different question types and difficulty levels.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare our method against static prompting baselines on diverse question-answering datasets. Evaluate using calibration metrics like ECE and MCE, as well as selective prediction performance."

        "Title": "Evolutionary Prompting for Calibrated Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current prompting methods often struggle to accurately capture the nuanced uncertainty of language models across diverse tasks and domains. This leads to poorly calibrated confidence estimates, which can be problematic in real-world applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on static prompts or simple confidence elicitation techniques that may not adapt well to different contexts. Inspired by evolutionary algorithms, we propose an adaptive prompting method that evolves and refines prompts to better calibrate confidence estimates across varying tasks. This approach leverages the power of iterative improvement and selection, potentially leading to more robust and adaptable confidence estimation techniques.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting pipeline: 1) Generate an initial population of diverse prompts for confidence elicitation. 2) Evaluate each prompt's effectiveness using a small calibration set. 3) Select top-performing prompts and create new ones through recombination and mutation operations. 4) Iterate steps 2-3 for multiple generations. 5) Use the final evolved prompt ensemble for confidence estimation on new inputs. The evolution process optimizes for prompts that yield well-calibrated confidence scores across different question types and difficulty levels.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use diverse question-answering datasets such as TriviaQA, Natural Questions, and SQuAD. Split each dataset into training, calibration, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement static prompting baselines: (a) Direct prompting: 'Answer the question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100.' (b) Detailed prompting: 'Answer the question, then explain your reasoning. Finally, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 based on your explanation.'",
            "Step 3: Initial Prompt Population": "Generate 20 diverse prompts for confidence elicitation. Examples: 'How certain are you about this answer?', 'On a scale of 0-100, how confident are you?', 'What's the probability that this answer is correct?'",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Function": "Implement an evaluation function using Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) on the calibration set.",
            "Step 5: Evolution Process": "Implement the evolutionary algorithm: a) Select top 5 prompts based on evaluation. b) Create 10 new prompts through crossover (combining parts of two prompts). c) Create 5 new prompts through mutation (small random changes to existing prompts). d) Evaluate new population and repeat for 10 generations.",
            "Step 6: Final Evaluation": "Use the best-performing prompt ensemble on the test set. Compare against baselines using ECE, MCE, and selective prediction performance (accuracy vs. coverage trade-off).",
            "Step 7: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the evolution of prompts across generations. Investigate which prompt features contribute most to improved calibration."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Answer the question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Answer the question. Then, consider potential alternative answers and any uncertainties. Finally, provide a calibrated confidence score from 0 to 100, where 0 means completely unsure and 100 means absolutely certain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Alternative answers could potentially include other major French cities like Lyon or Marseille, but these are not correct. There is very little uncertainty about this fact as it is widely known and hasn't changed in centuries. Calibrated confidence score: 99",
            "Explanation": "The evolved prompt encourages the model to consider alternatives and sources of uncertainty, leading to a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the evolutionary approach doesn't yield significant improvements, we can pivot to an analysis paper. We would investigate why certain prompts perform better than others, potentially uncovering insights about how language models reason about their own uncertainty. We could also explore combining our method with other techniques like calibration via temperature scaling or ensemble methods. Additionally, we could analyze how prompt effectiveness varies across different types of questions or domains, which could inform more targeted prompt engineering strategies."
