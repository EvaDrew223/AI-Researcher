        "Title": "Semantic Orthogonality Exploration: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often overlook important dimensions of uncertainty due to limited exploration of the semantic space, leading to overconfident or miscalibrated predictions.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on variations of a single line of reasoning or limited sampling strategies, which may not capture the full spectrum of uncertainty. By systematically exploring semantically orthogonal dimensions of a problem, we can uncover hidden sources of uncertainty and provide more comprehensive confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where experts consider multiple facets of a problem to assess their confidence in a solution.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Orthogonality Exploration (SOE), a multi-step process to enhance uncertainty quantification in LLMs: 1) Decompose the input query into core semantic dimensions (e.g., temporal, causal, ethical aspects). 2) For each dimension, generate a set of orthogonal sub-queries that explore different facets of the problem. 3) Obtain answers and confidence estimates for each sub-query. 4) Prompt the model to analyze how uncertainty in each semantic dimension contributes to overall uncertainty. 5) Aggregate the dimensional uncertainties using a learned combination function. 6) Generate a final answer and calibrated confidence score that accounts for the multi-dimensional uncertainty exploration.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex, multi-faceted reasoning tasks from datasets such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU (specifically sections on ethics, causality, and temporal reasoning), and TruthfulQA. These datasets cover a wide range of domains and require multi-dimensional reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: a) Direct prompting with confidence score request, b) Monte Carlo Dropout, c) Ensemble of few-shot prompts.",
            "Step 3: SOE Implementation": "Implement the SOE method: a) Develop prompts for semantic dimension decomposition, b) Generate orthogonal sub-queries for each dimension, c) Implement confidence estimation for sub-queries, d) Design prompts for uncertainty analysis across dimensions, e) Develop an aggregation function for dimensional uncertainties.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Assess performance using: a) Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), b) Correlation with expert-rated uncertainty, c) Ability to identify novel sources of uncertainty (measured by human evaluation), d) Task performance improvement when using SOE-based uncertainty to filter low-confidence answers.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component: a) Vary the number of semantic dimensions, b) Compare different aggregation functions, c) Analyze the impact of the number of orthogonal sub-queries per dimension.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform qualitative analysis on: a) The types of semantic dimensions identified, b) The nature of orthogonal sub-queries generated, c) How different dimensions contribute to overall uncertainty across various task types."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What would be the potential long-term economic impacts of implementing a universal basic income (UBI) system? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Implementing a universal basic income (UBI) system could have several potential long-term economic impacts:\n\n1. Reduced poverty and income inequality\n2. Increased consumer spending and economic stimulation\n3. Potential reduction in workforce participation\n4. Increased entrepreneurship and risk-taking\n5. Potential inflationary pressures\n6. Changes in labor market dynamics and wage negotiations\n7. Shifts in government spending priorities\n\nHowever, the exact impacts would depend on the specific implementation, funding mechanisms, and societal context.\n\nConfidence score: 75",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Dimension Decomposition)": "Q: What would be the potential long-term economic impacts of implementing a universal basic income (UBI) system? Please identify the core semantic dimensions we should consider when analyzing this question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Dimension Decomposition)": "Core semantic dimensions for analyzing the long-term economic impacts of UBI:\n1. Economic: Effects on GDP, inflation, and overall economic growth\n2. Social: Changes in poverty rates, income inequality, and social mobility\n3. Labor market: Impacts on employment rates, wage dynamics, and job seeking behavior\n4. Fiscal: Budgetary implications, taxation changes, and government spending\n5. Behavioral: Changes in consumer spending patterns and saving habits\n6. Entrepreneurial: Effects on business creation and innovation\n7. Temporal: Short-term vs. long-term economic consequences\n8. Geographical: Variations in impact across different regions or countries",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Generate Orthogonal Sub-queries)": "For the economic dimension of the UBI question, generate three orthogonal sub-queries that explore different aspects of the economic impact.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Generate Orthogonal Sub-queries)": "1. How might UBI affect inflation rates and monetary policy in the long term?\n2. What could be the impact of UBI on economic productivity and GDP growth?\n3. How might UBI influence income distribution and wealth inequality over time?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Sub-query Confidence Estimation)": "Q: How might UBI affect inflation rates and monetary policy in the long term? Provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Sub-query Confidence Estimation)": "A: UBI could potentially lead to increased inflation in the long term due to increased money supply and consumer spending. However, the exact impact would depend on how the UBI is funded and implemented. Central banks might need to adjust monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, possibly through higher interest rates. The relationship between UBI and inflation is complex and would likely vary based on the specific economic conditions and policy design.\n\nConfidence score: 65",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Dimensional Uncertainty Analysis)": "Based on the answers and confidence scores for the sub-queries related to the economic dimension of UBI implementation, analyze how uncertainty in this dimension contributes to the overall uncertainty in predicting the long-term economic impacts of UBI.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Dimensional Uncertainty Analysis)": "The economic dimension contributes significantly to the overall uncertainty in predicting the long-term impacts of UBI. Key factors include:\n1. Inflation uncertainty: The complex relationship between UBI, consumer spending, and inflation makes long-term predictions challenging.\n2. Productivity impact uncertainty: The effect of UBI on work incentives and overall economic productivity is debated and hard to predict accurately.\n3. Income distribution uncertainty: While UBI aims to reduce inequality, its long-term effects on wealth distribution are not fully understood.\n\nThese uncertainties compound each other, making the overall economic impact of UBI highly uncertain. The confidence scores in the 60-70 range for economic sub-queries reflect this high level of uncertainty, suggesting that the economic dimension is a major contributor to the overall uncertainty in UBI impact predictions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5 & 6: Final Answer and Confidence Score)": "Based on the analysis of all semantic dimensions and their associated uncertainties, provide a final answer to the question 'What would be the potential long-term economic impacts of implementing a universal basic income (UBI) system?' Also, provide a calibrated confidence score from 0 to 100 that accounts for the multi-dimensional uncertainty exploration.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5 & 6: Final Answer and Confidence Score)": "A: The potential long-term economic impacts of implementing a universal basic income (UBI) system are complex and multifaceted:\n\n1. Economic growth: UBI could stimulate consumer spending, potentially boosting economic growth. However, the extent of this effect is uncertain due to potential changes in work incentives and productivity.\n\n2. Inflation: There's a possibility of increased inflation, especially if UBI is funded through monetary expansion. The exact impact would depend on implementation and monetary policy responses.\n\n3. Income inequality: UBI aims to reduce income inequality, but the long-term effects on wealth distribution are uncertain and may vary based on the specific implementation and accompanying policies.\n\n4. Labor market dynamics: UBI could lead to shifts in employment patterns, potentially increasing part-time work and entrepreneurship while possibly reducing labor force participation in some sectors.\n\n5. Fiscal impacts: The funding mechanism for UBI would have significant implications for government budgets, taxation systems, and potentially national debt levels.\n\n6. Social and behavioral changes: UBI could lead to changes in education patterns, health outcomes, and social mobility, which would have indirect long-term economic effects.\n\n7. Regional and global economic shifts: The implementation of UBI in one country or region could have spillover effects on international trade, migration patterns, and global economic dynamics.\n\nIt's important to note that these impacts are interdependent and their magnitudes would vary based on the specific UBI model implemented, the existing economic and social structures, and concurrent policy changes.\n\nCalibrated Confidence Score: 58\n\nThis relatively low confidence score reflects the high level of uncertainty across multiple dimensions, including economic, social, and behavioral factors, as well as the long-term nature of the prediction which inherently increases uncertainty.",
            "explanation": "The SOE method provides a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the potential impacts of UBI by exploring multiple semantic dimensions. It explicitly acknowledges areas of uncertainty and provides a more calibrated confidence score compared to the baseline approach. The final answer incorporates insights from various dimensions, offering a richer and more balanced perspective on the complex issue of UBI implementation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SOE method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of which semantic dimensions contribute most to uncertainty across different types of questions. This could provide valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty in language models. 2) Investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the technique. 3) Explore alternative methods of combining uncertainties from different semantic dimensions, such as using the model itself to learn an optimal aggregation strategy. 4) Analyze cases where SOE performs worse than baselines to understand potential limitations or biases introduced by the method. 5) Investigate whether the generated sub-queries and their answers could be used to improve the overall quality of responses, even if they don't directly improve uncertainty quantification. This could turn the project into a study on using semantic decomposition for general improvement of LLM outputs."
