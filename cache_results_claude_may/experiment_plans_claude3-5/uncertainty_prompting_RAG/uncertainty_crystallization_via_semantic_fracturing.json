        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simplistic confidence scores or repetitive sampling, failing to capture the nuanced, multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like softmax probabilities, ensemble methods, or direct confidence elicitation through prompting.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down a complex query into its fundamental semantic components and assessing uncertainty at each level, we can build a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the model's overall uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Crystallization via Semantic Fracturing (UCSF). Given a complex query, UCSF first prompts the LLM to decompose it into a hierarchy of simpler sub-queries, forming a semantic tree. For each node in this tree, we then prompt the LLM to provide an answer and an associated confidence score. We aggregate these scores bottom-up, using a novel uncertainty propagation algorithm that considers the logical relationships between nodes. Finally, we prompt the LLM to synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate, informed by this detailed uncertainty map.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UCSF against baseline methods on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like HotpotQA and FEVER, using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic curve (AUCE). We will also conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of the UCSF pipeline."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Crystallization via Semantic Fracturing: A Novel Approach to Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic confidence scores or repetitive sampling, failing to capture the nuanced, multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders the reliable deployment of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like softmax probabilities, ensemble methods, or direct confidence elicitation through prompting. These methods often fall short in capturing the hierarchical and compositional nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. By breaking down a complex query into its fundamental semantic components and assessing uncertainty at each level, we can build a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the model's overall uncertainty. This approach is inspired by how humans approach complex problems, decomposing them into simpler sub-problems and assessing confidence at each step.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Crystallization via Semantic Fracturing (UCSF). Given a complex query, UCSF first prompts the LLM to decompose it into a hierarchy of simpler sub-queries, forming a semantic tree. For each node in this tree, we then prompt the LLM to provide an answer and an associated confidence score. We aggregate these scores bottom-up, using a novel uncertainty propagation algorithm that considers the logical relationships between nodes. Finally, we prompt the LLM to synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate, informed by this detailed uncertainty map.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from datasets like HotpotQA and FEVER. These datasets involve multi-hop reasoning and fact verification, which are ideal for testing our method. Preprocess the datasets to ensure they are in a suitable format for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement baseline methods for uncertainty quantification: (a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. (b) Monte Carlo Dropout: Perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled, using the variance of the outputs as an uncertainty measure. (c) Ensemble method: Use multiple model instances or checkpoints and measure disagreement.",
            "Step 3: UCSF Implementation": "Implement the UCSF method with the following sub-steps: (a) Semantic Fracturing: Prompt the LLM to decompose the main query into a hierarchy of sub-queries. Example prompt: 'Decompose the following question into a tree of simpler sub-questions, where each node represents a step in the reasoning process: [QUESTION]' (b) Node-level Uncertainty: For each node in the semantic tree, prompt the LLM to answer the sub-query and provide a confidence score. Example prompt: 'Answer the following sub-question and provide your confidence on a scale of 0-100: [SUB-QUESTION]' (c) Uncertainty Propagation: Implement an algorithm to aggregate node-level uncertainties, considering the logical structure of the semantic tree. (d) Final Synthesis: Prompt the LLM to provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate based on the semantic tree and propagated uncertainties. Example prompt: 'Given the following semantic tree with sub-questions, answers, and confidence scores, provide a final answer to the main question and an overall confidence estimate: [SEMANTIC_TREE]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models have demonstrated strong performance on complex reasoning tasks and provide a good testbed for our method.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of UCSF against the baseline methods using the following metrics: (a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the alignment between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. (b) Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic curve (AUCE): Assess the trade-off between confidence and error rate. (c) Brier Score: Evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (d) Answer Accuracy: Compare the accuracy of final answers between UCSF and baselines.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of the UCSF pipeline: (a) Vary the depth of the semantic tree to understand its impact on uncertainty estimation. (b) Compare different uncertainty propagation algorithms. (c) Evaluate the effect of using different prompts for semantic fracturing and confidence elicitation.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform a detailed analysis of the results: (a) Visualize the semantic trees and uncertainty propagation for a subset of examples. (b) Analyze cases where UCSF significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. (c) Investigate the relationship between task complexity (e.g., number of reasoning steps) and the effectiveness of UCSF.",
            "Step 8: Generalization Tests": "Test the generalization of UCSF on other datasets or tasks not seen during development, such as mathematical reasoning tasks from MATH dataset or commonsense reasoning tasks from COPA."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: The Nile River flows through two countries. One is Egypt. What is the other country? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The other country that the Nile River flows through is Sudan. Confidence: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCSF Step 1: Semantic Fracturing)": "Decompose the following question into a tree of simpler sub-questions, where each node represents a step in the reasoning process: The Nile River flows through two countries. One is Egypt. What is the other country?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCSF Step 1: Semantic Fracturing)": "1. What are the major countries that the Nile River flows through?\n   1.1 What is the source of the Nile River?\n   1.2 What is the course of the Nile River?\n2. Which of these countries is not Egypt?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCSF Step 2: Node-level Uncertainty)": "Answer the following sub-question and provide your confidence on a scale of 0-100: What are the major countries that the Nile River flows through?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCSF Step 2: Node-level Uncertainty)": "A: The major countries that the Nile River flows through are Egypt and Sudan. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCSF Step 3: Final Synthesis)": "Given the following semantic tree with sub-questions, answers, and confidence scores, provide a final answer to the main question and an overall confidence estimate: [SEMANTIC_TREE]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCSF Step 3: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The other country that the Nile River flows through, besides Egypt, is Sudan. Overall Confidence: 92",
            "Explanation": "UCSF provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by breaking down the question into sub-components and assessing confidence at each step. This allows for a more robust final confidence score compared to the baseline method, which might overlook potential sources of uncertainty in the reasoning process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UCSF method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why UCSF fails. This could involve categorizing different types of reasoning errors and uncertainty misestimations, potentially leading to insights about LLM reasoning processes. Second, we could explore hybrid approaches that combine UCSF with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using ensemble methods on the sub-queries generated by semantic fracturing. Third, we could investigate how the semantic trees generated by UCSF correlate with human-annotated reasoning steps, turning the project into an analysis of LLM reasoning patterns. Finally, we could explore using the semantic trees generated by UCSF as a form of interpretable intermediate representation, potentially useful for other tasks beyond uncertainty estimation, such as fact-checking or answer explanation generation."
