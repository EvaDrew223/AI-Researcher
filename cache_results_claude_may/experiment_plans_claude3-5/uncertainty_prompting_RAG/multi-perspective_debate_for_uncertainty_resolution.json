        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overconfident answers without considering alternative viewpoints or potential sources of uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on single-perspective responses or simple ensemble techniques to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a multi-perspective debate, we can uncover potential sources of uncertainty and obtain a more nuanced and well-calibrated confidence estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Perspective Debate for Uncertainty Resolution (MPDUR), which involves: 1) Generate multiple distinct perspectives on the given query. Prompt: 'Provide 3 different expert perspectives on this question: [QUERY]'. 2) Simulate a debate between these perspectives, highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. Prompt: 'Simulate a debate between the following perspectives, focusing on areas of agreement and disagreement: [PERSPECTIVES]'. 3) Synthesize the debate into a final answer, uncertainty estimate, and rationale. Prompt: 'Based on the preceding debate, provide a final answer, confidence level (0-100%), and explanation for your uncertainty estimate: [DEBATE_SUMMARY]'. 4) Calibrate the final uncertainty estimate based on the level of disagreement in the debate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MPDUR on complex, multi-faceted questions from datasets like ARC-Challenge or adversarially-created datasets designed to probe uncertainty. Compare against single-perspective and ensemble methods using metrics like ECE, Brier score, and a novel metric quantifying the correlation between debate disagreement and actual error rates."

        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Debate for Uncertainty Resolution: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overconfident answers without considering alternative viewpoints or potential sources of uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates. This issue can result in misleading or unreliable outputs, especially in complex or ambiguous scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically rely on single-perspective responses or simple ensemble techniques, which may not capture the full range of potential uncertainties. By simulating a multi-perspective debate, we can uncover potential sources of uncertainty and obtain a more nuanced and well-calibrated confidence estimate. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to generate diverse viewpoints and engage in self-dialogue, potentially leading to more robust and reliable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Perspective Debate for Uncertainty Resolution (MPDUR), which involves four main steps: 1) Generate multiple distinct perspectives on the given query. 2) Simulate a debate between these perspectives, highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. 3) Synthesize the debate into a final answer, uncertainty estimate, and rationale. 4) Calibrate the final uncertainty estimate based on the level of disagreement in the debate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare datasets for evaluation, including ARC-Challenge for complex science questions and an adversarially-created dataset designed to probe uncertainty. For the adversarial dataset, create a set of 100-200 questions with known ambiguities or multiple valid interpretations.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Single-perspective response: directly query the LLM for an answer and confidence estimate. 2) Simple ensemble: generate multiple independent responses and aggregate them for a final answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 3: MPDUR Implementation": "Implement the MPDUR method with the following steps: a) Perspective generation: Prompt: 'Provide 3 different expert perspectives on this question: [QUERY]'. b) Debate simulation: Prompt: 'Simulate a debate between the following perspectives, focusing on areas of agreement and disagreement: [PERSPECTIVES]'. c) Synthesis: Prompt: 'Based on the preceding debate, provide a final answer, confidence level (0-100%), and explanation for your uncertainty estimate: [DEBATE_SUMMARY]'. d) Calibration: Develop a function to adjust the final confidence based on the level of disagreement in the debate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess performance across different model sizes.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate all methods on both datasets using the following metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure overall calibration. b) Brier score to assess probabilistic predictions. c) A novel metric quantifying the correlation between debate disagreement and actual error rates. d) Accuracy of final answers to ensure the method doesn't sacrifice correctness for better calibration.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of MPDUR against baselines across all metrics. b) Examination of cases where MPDUR significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines. c) Analysis of the relationship between debate intensity and uncertainty estimates. d) Investigation of how different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. open-ended) affect the performance of MPDUR."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 on ocean acidity?",
                "Single-Perspective Output": "Increasing atmospheric CO2 leads to increased ocean acidity. As more CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, lowering the pH of the ocean water. This process is known as ocean acidification. Confidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "The single-perspective approach provides a correct but simplistic answer with high confidence, potentially overlooking nuances or uncertainties in the complex relationship between atmospheric CO2 and ocean chemistry."
            },
            "MPDUR Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 on ocean acidity?",
                "Step 1 - Generate Perspectives": "Perspective 1: Increasing atmospheric CO2 directly leads to ocean acidification through the formation of carbonic acid.\nPerspective 2: While CO2 does increase ocean acidity, the relationship is complex and can be influenced by other factors such as temperature and biological processes.\nPerspective 3: The effect of increasing CO2 on ocean acidity varies significantly across different ocean regions and depths.",
                "Step 2 - Simulate Debate": "The debate highlights agreement on the general trend of increasing CO2 leading to higher ocean acidity. However, disagreements arise on the uniformity and simplicity of this relationship. Perspective 2 emphasizes the complexity of the process, while Perspective 3 points out spatial variations. The debate also touches on potential feedback loops and the role of marine ecosystems in modulating this effect.",
                "Step 3 - Synthesize": "Final Answer: Increasing atmospheric CO2 generally leads to increased ocean acidity, but the relationship is complex and can vary across different ocean regions and depths. As CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, it forms carbonic acid, lowering the pH of the water. However, this process is influenced by factors such as temperature, biological activity, and local ocean chemistry. Confidence: 80%\nExplanation for uncertainty: The lower confidence reflects the complexity of the process and the spatial variations highlighted in the debate. While the general trend is well-established, the exact effects can vary and may not be uniform across all ocean areas.",
                "Explanation": "MPDUR provides a more nuanced answer that acknowledges the general trend while also recognizing the complexities and variations in the process. The lower confidence (80% vs. 95%) better reflects the uncertainties involved in this complex system."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MPDUR doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why MPDUR fails to capture uncertainties effectively. This could involve categorizing the types of questions or scenarios where MPDUR underperforms. 2) Explore variations of the MPDUR method, such as increasing the number of perspectives or modifying the debate structure. We could experiment with different prompting strategies for generating perspectives or guiding the debate. 3) Investigate the relationship between debate characteristics (e.g., length, diversity of arguments) and prediction accuracy. This could lead to insights on how to better leverage multi-perspective debates for uncertainty estimation. 4) Combine MPDUR with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. 5) If MPDUR consistently fails to improve calibration, we could refocus the project on analyzing why simulating debates doesn't lead to better uncertainty estimates in LLMs, potentially uncovering interesting insights about how these models process and synthesize conflicting information."
