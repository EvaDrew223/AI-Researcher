    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often produce inconsistent responses and confidence estimates when queried multiple times or over extended conversations, undermining trust in their outputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically focus on single-turn interactions and do not explicitly address temporal consistency in confidence estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to consider its past responses and confidence estimates, we can encourage more consistent and reliable confidence calibration over time.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Consistency Prompting (TCP): 1) Context Maintenance: Maintain a running log of past queries, responses, and confidence estimates. 2) Consistency Check: Before generating a new response, prompt the model to review past interactions and identify any potential inconsistencies. 3) Confidence Adjustment: If inconsistencies are found, prompt the model to explain the discrepancy and adjust its confidence accordingly. 4) Response Generation: Generate the new response with an updated confidence score, taking into account the temporal context. 5) Meta-Learning: Periodically prompt the model to reflect on its consistency over time and generate strategies for improving future consistency.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TCP on multi-turn conversation datasets and long-form question-answering tasks. Compare with standard prompting and other confidence estimation techniques, measuring both response quality and confidence calibration consistency over time using metrics like temporal calibration error."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models over Extended Interactions",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent responses and confidence estimates when queried multiple times or over extended conversations, undermining trust in their outputs. This inconsistency is particularly problematic in applications requiring reliable and consistent confidence calibration over time.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods typically focus on single-turn interactions and do not explicitly address temporal consistency in confidence estimation. By prompting the model to consider its past responses and confidence estimates, we can encourage more consistent and reliable confidence calibration over time. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to improve its performance without requiring additional training or external components.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Consistency Prompting (TCP), a multi-step prompting method that encourages LLMs to maintain consistent confidence estimates over time. The steps are: 1) Context Maintenance: Maintain a running log of past queries, responses, and confidence estimates. 2) Consistency Check: Before generating a new response, prompt the model to review past interactions and identify potential inconsistencies. 3) Confidence Adjustment: If inconsistencies are found, prompt the model to explain the discrepancy and adjust its confidence accordingly. 4) Response Generation: Generate the new response with an updated confidence score, taking into account the temporal context. 5) Meta-Learning: Periodically prompt the model to reflect on its consistency over time and generate strategies for improving future consistency.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare multi-turn conversation datasets and long-form question-answering tasks. We will use the MultiWOZ dataset for task-oriented dialogues and the CoQA dataset for conversational question answering. Additionally, create a custom dataset of extended interactions on specific topics to test long-term consistency.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and other confidence estimation techniques as baselines. These will include: a) Direct prompting without confidence estimation, b) Single-turn confidence estimation using calibrated softmax probabilities, c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation.",
            "Step 3: TCP Implementation": "Implement the Temporal Consistency Prompting method. For each step, create specific prompts:\n1) Context Maintenance: 'Here is the conversation history: [Insert past queries, responses, and confidence estimates]'\n2) Consistency Check: 'Review the conversation history. Are there any inconsistencies in the responses or confidence estimates? If yes, list them.'\n3) Confidence Adjustment: 'Given the identified inconsistencies, how should the confidence estimate be adjusted? Explain your reasoning.'\n4) Response Generation: 'Considering the conversation history and any adjustments, provide a response to the current query with an updated confidence estimate.'\n5) Meta-Learning: 'Reflect on your consistency in this conversation. What strategies can you employ to improve consistency in future interactions?'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for the experiments. Also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics:\n1) Temporal Calibration Error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy over time.\n2) Consistency Score: Calculate the variance in confidence estimates for similar questions across the conversation.\n3) Response Quality: Use automated metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, as well as manual evaluation for a subset of responses.\n4) Meta-Learning Effectiveness: Qualitatively assess the strategies generated in the meta-learning step.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\n1) Run the baseline methods and collect results.\n2) Run the TCP method and collect results.\n3) For TCP, vary the frequency of consistency checks and meta-learning prompts to find optimal settings.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare TCP against baselines:\n1) Plot temporal calibration error over conversation length.\n2) Compare consistency scores across methods.\n3) Analyze response quality to ensure improved consistency doesn't come at the cost of quality.\n4) Examine meta-learning outputs to identify emerging patterns in self-improvement strategies.\n5) Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each TCP component."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q1: What is the capital of France?\nQ2: How many people live in Paris?\nQ3: What is the population of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A1: The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 95%)\nA2: The population of Paris is approximately 2.2 million people. (Confidence: 80%)\nA3: The population of France is about 67 million people. (Confidence: 85%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP)": "Conversation history:\nQ1: What is the capital of France?\nA1: The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 95%)\nQ2: How many people live in Paris?\nA2: The population of Paris is approximately 2.2 million people. (Confidence: 80%)\n\nCurrent query:\nQ3: What is the population of France?\n\nPlease review the conversation history. Are there any inconsistencies in the responses or confidence estimates? If yes, list them.\n\nGiven any identified inconsistencies, how should the confidence estimate be adjusted for the current query? Explain your reasoning.\n\nConsidering the conversation history and any adjustments, provide a response to the current query with an updated confidence estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP)": "Review: There are no significant inconsistencies in the previous responses or confidence estimates. The confidence levels seem appropriate given the nature of the questions.\n\nConfidence Adjustment: For the current query about the population of France, we should maintain a similar confidence level to the previous population-related question (about Paris). However, since this is a national statistic which tends to be more precisely tracked, we might slightly increase our confidence.\n\nResponse: The population of France is approximately 67 million people. (Confidence: 88%)\n\nExplanation: The slightly higher confidence (88% vs 80% for the Paris population) reflects that national population figures are generally more accurate and frequently updated than city populations. However, we maintain some uncertainty due to the dynamic nature of population statistics and potential for slight variations in recent estimates.",
            "Explanation": "The TCP method demonstrates improved consistency in confidence estimation by considering the previous responses and their confidence levels. It provides a reasoned adjustment to the confidence estimate based on the nature of the question and its relation to previous queries, resulting in a more calibrated and consistent confidence score over the course of the conversation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCP method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration consistency, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why inconsistencies occur. This might involve categorizing types of inconsistencies (e.g., factual, confidence-related, or reasoning-based) and analyzing their frequency and impact. Second, we could explore variations of the TCP method, such as incorporating external knowledge sources for fact-checking or implementing a sliding window approach for long conversations to manage computational complexity. Third, we might investigate the relationship between consistency and other aspects of model performance, such as factual accuracy or reasoning ability. This could lead to insights about trade-offs between different aspects of model performance and potential areas for improvement in LLM training and prompting strategies. Finally, we could turn the project into an analysis paper, offering insights into the challenges of maintaining consistency in extended LLM interactions and proposing a roadmap for future research in this area."
