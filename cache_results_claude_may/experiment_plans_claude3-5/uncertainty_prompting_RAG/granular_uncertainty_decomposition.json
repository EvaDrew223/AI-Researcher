        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overly broad or imprecise uncertainty estimates, failing to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods produce a single, holistic uncertainty score, which can obscure important details about the sources and nature of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down complex queries into atomic components and assessing uncertainty at a granular level, we can achieve more precise and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Granular Uncertainty Decomposition (GUD), a prompting technique that systematically decomposes complex queries and assesses uncertainty at multiple levels. The process involves: 1) Prompting the model to break down the query into atomic subcomponents or steps. 2) For each subcomponent, generating a response and a localized uncertainty estimate. 3) Identifying dependencies between subcomponents and how uncertainties propagate. 4) Synthesizing the granular uncertainties into a structured uncertainty profile for the overall query. 5) Providing both an aggregate uncertainty score and a detailed breakdown of uncertainty sources. This approach allows for more precise uncertainty quantification and better understanding of where and why the model is uncertain.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare GUD with holistic uncertainty estimation methods on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or integrating multiple knowledge domains, such as complex word problems, multi-hop question answering, or interdisciplinary analysis. Evaluate using metrics that assess both overall calibration and the accuracy of uncertainty attribution to specific subcomponents."

        "Title": "Granular Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overly broad or imprecise uncertainty estimates, failing to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex queries. This limitation hinders the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding the specific areas of model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically produce a single, holistic uncertainty score, which can obscure important details about the sources and nature of the model's uncertainty. By breaking down complex queries into atomic components and assessing uncertainty at a granular level, we can achieve more precise and interpretable uncertainty quantification. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of where and why the model is uncertain, potentially leading to more informed decision-making and targeted improvements in model performance.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Granular Uncertainty Decomposition (GUD), a prompting technique that systematically decomposes complex queries and assesses uncertainty at multiple levels. The process involves five key steps: 1) Prompting the model to break down the query into atomic subcomponents or steps. 2) For each subcomponent, generating a response and a localized uncertainty estimate. 3) Identifying dependencies between subcomponents and how uncertainties propagate. 4) Synthesizing the granular uncertainties into a structured uncertainty profile for the overall query. 5) Providing both an aggregate uncertainty score and a detailed breakdown of uncertainty sources.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require multi-step reasoning or integration of multiple knowledge domains: 1) GSM8K for complex math word problems, 2) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, and 3) ScienceQA for interdisciplinary scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with a request for confidence score, and 2) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: GUD Implementation": "Implement the GUD method with the following sub-steps: a) Query decomposition prompt, b) Subcomponent response and uncertainty estimation prompt, c) Dependency identification prompt, d) Uncertainty synthesis prompt.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model, with GPT-3.5-turbo as a secondary model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error to assess overall uncertainty estimation quality, 2) Spearman correlation between subcomponent uncertainties and actual errors, 3) Human evaluation of uncertainty attribution accuracy.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and GUD), we will: a) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates for all test samples, b) Calculate evaluation metrics, c) Perform statistical significance tests to compare methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of results, including: a) Comparison of GUD vs baselines across different task types, b) Examination of uncertainty propagation in multi-step reasoning, c) Identification of common patterns in uncertainty attribution."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then increases its speed to 80 mph for the next 1.5 hours, how far has it traveled in total? Please provide your answer along with a confidence score from 0 to 1, where 0 is completely uncertain and 1 is completely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Answer: The train has traveled 240 miles in total. Here's the calculation:\n1. For the first 2 hours at 60 mph: 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n2. For the next 1.5 hours at 80 mph: 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles\n3. Total distance: 120 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles\n\nConfidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GUD; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "Break down the following question into atomic subcomponents or steps: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then increases its speed to 80 mph for the next 1.5 hours, how far has it traveled in total?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GUD; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "1. Calculate distance traveled in the first 2 hours at 60 mph\n2. Calculate distance traveled in the next 1.5 hours at 80 mph\n3. Sum the distances from steps 1 and 2",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GUD; Step 2: Subcomponent Response and Uncertainty)": "For each subcomponent, provide a response and a localized uncertainty estimate (0-1 scale):\n1. Calculate distance traveled in the first 2 hours at 60 mph\n2. Calculate distance traveled in the next 1.5 hours at 80 mph\n3. Sum the distances from steps 1 and 2",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GUD; Step 2: Subcomponent Response and Uncertainty)": "1. Response: 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n   Uncertainty: 0.1 (Very certain about this calculation)\n2. Response: 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles\n   Uncertainty: 0.2 (Fairly certain, but slightly less so due to the fractional hour)\n3. Response: 120 miles + 120 miles = 240 miles\n   Uncertainty: 0.05 (Very certain about this addition)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GUD; Step 3: Dependency Identification)": "Identify dependencies between the subcomponents and describe how uncertainties might propagate:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GUD; Step 3: Dependency Identification)": "Dependencies:\n1. Step 3 depends on the results of both Step 1 and Step 2.\n2. Steps 1 and 2 are independent of each other.\n\nUncertainty propagation:\n1. The uncertainty in Step 3 is influenced by the uncertainties in both Step 1 and Step 2.\n2. As Step 3 involves addition, the absolute uncertainties from Steps 1 and 2 would typically be added (not multiplied) when propagating to the final result.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GUD; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the subcomponent responses, uncertainties, and dependencies, provide an aggregate uncertainty score and a detailed breakdown of uncertainty sources for the overall query.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GUD; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Aggregate uncertainty score: 0.25\n\nDetailed breakdown of uncertainty sources:\n1. Distance calculation for first leg (60 mph for 2 hours): Low uncertainty (0.1) due to simple integer multiplication.\n2. Distance calculation for second leg (80 mph for 1.5 hours): Slightly higher uncertainty (0.2) due to fractional hour, which might introduce minor rounding errors.\n3. Final summation: Very low uncertainty (0.05) as it's a simple addition of two values.\n4. Overall uncertainty is primarily driven by the calculation involving the fractional hour in the second leg of the journey.\n5. The aggregate score (0.25) is higher than individual components to account for potential compound effects and any unforeseen sources of error in the problem interpretation.",
            "explanation": "The GUD method provides a more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification compared to the baseline. It breaks down the problem into steps, assesses uncertainty for each step, considers dependencies, and synthesizes a final uncertainty profile. This approach allows for pinpointing specific sources of uncertainty, such as the calculation involving a fractional hour, which might be overlooked in a holistic uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed GUD method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why GUD fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLM uncertainty estimation techniques. 2) Explore variations of the GUD method, such as iterative refinement of uncertainty estimates or incorporating external knowledge sources for verification. 3) Investigate the relationship between task complexity and the effectiveness of granular uncertainty decomposition, which could lead to a more nuanced understanding of when such techniques are most beneficial. 4) Analyze the linguistic patterns in high-uncertainty vs. low-uncertainty components, potentially uncovering new heuristics for identifying uncertain model outputs. 5) Develop a hybrid approach that combines GUD with other uncertainty estimation techniques, leveraging the strengths of multiple methods."
