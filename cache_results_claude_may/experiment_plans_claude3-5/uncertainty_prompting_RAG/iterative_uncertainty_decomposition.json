    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often provide a single, aggregate uncertainty estimate that fails to capture the nuanced sources of their uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most uncertainty quantification methods focus on producing a scalar confidence score without explicating the underlying factors.",
        "Motivation": "By iteratively decomposing uncertainty into its constituent components, we can obtain more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Uncertainty Decomposition (IUD), a multi-step prompting approach that progressively breaks down a model's uncertainty into interpretable factors. IUD starts with a high-level uncertainty estimate, then uses targeted follow-up prompts to identify specific sources (e.g., 'Is the uncertainty due to ambiguous language?', 'Is it because of missing context?'). Each identified factor triggers further decomposition, creating a tree-like structure of uncertainty sources. The process continues until reaching atomic factors or a confidence threshold. The final output is a structured representation of the model's uncertainty, detailing contributing factors and their relative importance.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IUD against baseline uncertainty estimation methods on tasks requiring fine-grained uncertainty assessment, such as open-ended question answering and complex reasoning tasks. Measure improvements in uncertainty decomposition quality, interpretability, and the ability to guide targeted information gathering."

        "Title": "Iterative Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide a single, aggregate uncertainty estimate that fails to capture the nuanced sources of their uncertainty. This lack of granularity in uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and actionability of model outputs, especially in high-stakes decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods typically focus on producing scalar confidence scores without explicating the underlying factors contributing to uncertainty. By iteratively decomposing uncertainty into its constituent components, we can obtain more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human decision-making processes, where we often break down complex uncertainties into more manageable and interpretable components.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Uncertainty Decomposition (IUD), a multi-step prompting approach that progressively breaks down a model's uncertainty into interpretable factors. IUD starts with a high-level uncertainty estimate, then uses targeted follow-up prompts to identify specific sources (e.g., 'Is the uncertainty due to ambiguous language?', 'Is it because of missing context?'). Each identified factor triggers further decomposition, creating a tree-like structure of uncertainty sources. The process continues until reaching atomic factors or a confidence threshold. The final output is a structured representation of the model's uncertainty, detailing contributing factors and their relative importance.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require fine-grained uncertainty assessment: (1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, (2) MMLU for multi-task reasoning, and (3) AmbigQA for ambiguous questions. These datasets cover a range of scenarios where detailed uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence estimation: prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for its answer. (2) Monte Carlo Dropout: use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: IUD Implementation": "Implement the Iterative Uncertainty Decomposition method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response and confidence estimation. b) First-level decomposition into broad categories (e.g., data uncertainty, model uncertainty, linguistic uncertainty). c) Second-level decomposition for each category. d) Continue decomposition until reaching atomic factors or a confidence threshold.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Prompting Strategy": "Design prompts for each step of IUD. For example: Initial prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence level: [QUESTION]' First-level decomposition: 'What are the main sources of your uncertainty in this answer? List them and explain briefly.' Second-level decomposition: 'For the uncertainty source [SOURCE], what are the specific factors contributing to this uncertainty?'",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: (1) Calibration error: measure how well the decomposed uncertainty aligns with actual error rates. (2) Decomposition quality: human evaluation of the relevance and granularity of identified uncertainty factors. (3) Decision support: measure how well the decomposed uncertainty guides targeted information gathering (e.g., by prompting for specific missing information).",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and IUD. For each dataset, process at least 1000 examples to ensure statistical significance.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform quantitative analysis comparing IUD against baselines. Conduct qualitative analysis on a subset of examples to understand the nature of decomposed uncertainties. Investigate how decomposition depth affects performance and interpretability."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and confidence level.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and initial confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence level: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2)": "What are the main sources of your uncertainty in this answer? List them and explain briefly.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2)": "1. Temporal uncertainty (5%): While Paris is currently the capital, capitals can change over time.\n2. Definition uncertainty (3%): There might be different definitions of 'capital' (e.g., administrative, cultural).\n3. Knowledge recall uncertainty (2%): While I'm very confident, there's a small chance of misremembering.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3)": "For the uncertainty source 'Temporal uncertainty', what are the specific factors contributing to this uncertainty?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3)": "Factors contributing to temporal uncertainty:\n1. Historical changes (3%): France has had different capitals in its history (e.g., Versailles).\n2. Future potential changes (2%): While unlikely, there's a possibility of the capital changing in the future due to political decisions or environmental factors.",
            "Explanation": "The IUD method provides a more detailed and actionable uncertainty decomposition compared to the baseline. It identifies specific sources of uncertainty and allows for further decomposition, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IUD method doesn't significantly improve over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the patterns in uncertainty decomposition across different types of questions and tasks, potentially uncovering insights about model behavior and limitations. Second, we could investigate how different prompting strategies affect the quality and consistency of uncertainty decomposition, which could inform better prompt engineering practices. Third, we could explore combining IUD with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies. Finally, if the decomposition itself proves challenging, we could focus on developing a taxonomy of uncertainty types in language models, which would be valuable for future research in this area."
