    "idea_name": "Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Uncertainty",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often fail to account for the model's robustness to slight variations in input, which can be crucial for assessing true confidence, especially in tasks requiring nuanced understanding.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on estimating uncertainty for a single input, without considering how that uncertainty might change with small semantic perturbations.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of semantic neighborhoods in natural language processing and the idea that truly confident answers should be robust to small variations in question phrasing, we propose a method to probe an LLM's uncertainty through exploration of the semantic neighborhood of a given input.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Uncertainty (SNEU), a prompting strategy that assesses the LLM's uncertainty by testing its robustness to semantically similar inputs. For a given query, SNEU first prompts the LLM to generate a set of semantically similar queries. For example, given the question 'What is the capital of France?', it might generate variations like 'Which city serves as the capital of France?', 'What's the name of France's capital city?', etc. The LLM is then prompted to answer each of these variations and provide confidence estimates. The prompt might look like: 'Answer each of the following related questions and provide a confidence score for each answer. Then, explain any differences in your answers or confidence levels.' The variance in answers and confidence scores across this semantic neighborhood is used to modulate the final uncertainty estimate for the original query. High variance indicates higher uncertainty, while low variance suggests more robust confidence. This method aims to capture not just point-estimate uncertainty, but uncertainty that arises from the model's sensitivity to slight variations in input phrasing.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SNEU on a range of tasks including factual QA, reasoning problems, and open-ended generation. We'll compare its performance to standard confidence estimation techniques and other advanced prompting methods, using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score. We'll also assess the method's ability to identify instances where the model's confidence is fragile to small semantic perturbations."

        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for the model's robustness to slight variations in input, which can be crucial for assessing true confidence, especially in tasks requiring nuanced understanding. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions on inputs that are sensitive to small semantic perturbations, potentially resulting in unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on estimating uncertainty for a single input, without considering how that uncertainty might change with small semantic perturbations. Inspired by the concept of semantic neighborhoods in natural language processing and the idea that truly confident answers should be robust to small variations in question phrasing, we propose a method to probe an LLM's uncertainty through exploration of the semantic neighborhood of a given input. This approach aims to capture not just point-estimate uncertainty, but uncertainty that arises from the model's sensitivity to slight variations in input phrasing, providing a more comprehensive and robust measure of model confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Uncertainty (SNEU), a prompting strategy that assesses the LLM's uncertainty by testing its robustness to semantically similar inputs. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Semantic Neighborhood Generation: For a given query, we prompt the LLM to generate a set of semantically similar queries. 2) Multi-Query Evaluation: We then prompt the LLM to answer each of these variations and provide confidence estimates. 3) Uncertainty Aggregation: The variance in answers and confidence scores across this semantic neighborhood is used to modulate the final uncertainty estimate for the original query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate SNEU: 1) TriviaQA for factual question answering, 2) SWAG for commonsense reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of task types and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include Claude from Anthropic as an additional model for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Softmax probability as a confidence score, and 2) Monte Carlo Dropout (if possible with the API, otherwise we'll use an alternative like temperature scaling).",
            "Step 4: SNEU Implementation": "Implement the SNEU method with the following sub-steps: a) Semantic Neighborhood Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 5 semantically similar queries for each input question. b) Multi-Query Evaluation: For each generated query (including the original), prompt the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score (1-100). c) Uncertainty Aggregation: Calculate the variance in answers and confidence scores across the semantic neighborhood.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of SNEU against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Brier Score, and 3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform additional analyses: 1) Correlation between semantic neighborhood size and uncertainty estimation quality. 2) Impact of task difficulty on SNEU performance. 3) Qualitative analysis of cases where SNEU significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SNEU doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why semantic neighborhood exploration doesn't improve uncertainty estimation as expected. We'll conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of SNEU, such as neighborhood size, query generation quality, and aggregation methods. We can also investigate how SNEU performs across different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning) and analyze patterns in cases where it fails. Additionally, we could explore combining SNEU with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling semantic variations and inform future research directions in robust uncertainty estimation."
