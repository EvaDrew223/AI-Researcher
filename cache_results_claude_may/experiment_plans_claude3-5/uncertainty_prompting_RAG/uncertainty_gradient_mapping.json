    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimates across different knowledge domains and question types, often exhibiting overconfidence or underconfidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on output logits or single-pass confidence scores, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by optimization techniques in machine learning, we propose to explore the 'uncertainty landscape' of an LLM's knowledge by probing its responses across a continuum of increasingly challenging questions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Gradient Mapping (UGM), a novel prompting method that generates a series of questions with increasing difficulty levels for a given topic. The prompt instructs the LLM to answer each question and provide a confidence score. By analyzing the pattern of confidence scores across the difficulty gradient, we can map out the model's uncertainty landscape. The prompt also includes instructions for the LLM to identify the inflection point where its confidence begins to decrease significantly, providing a more nuanced understanding of its knowledge boundaries. This method allows for a fine-grained analysis of uncertainty across different domains and question complexities.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UGM against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and temperature scaling on a range of tasks including factual QA, reasoning problems, and domain-specific knowledge tests. We'll measure calibration using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and compare the method's ability to identify knowledge boundaries accurately."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Gradient Mapping: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Progressive Questioning",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimates across different knowledge domains and question types, frequently exhibiting overconfidence or underconfidence. This inconsistency in uncertainty estimation limits the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically rely on output logits or single-pass confidence scores, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty. Inspired by optimization techniques in machine learning, we propose to explore the 'uncertainty landscape' of an LLM's knowledge by probing its responses across a continuum of increasingly challenging questions. This approach aims to provide a more nuanced and accurate representation of model uncertainty, potentially improving the calibration and reliability of LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Gradient Mapping (UGM), a novel prompting method that generates a series of questions with increasing difficulty levels for a given topic. The process involves the following steps: 1) Given an initial question, generate a series of related questions with increasing difficulty. 2) For each question, prompt the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score. 3) Analyze the pattern of confidence scores across the difficulty gradient to map out the model's uncertainty landscape. 4) Identify the inflection point where the model's confidence begins to decrease significantly, providing insight into its knowledge boundaries. This method allows for a fine-grained analysis of uncertainty across different domains and question complexities.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of datasets to evaluate UGM: 1) TriviaQA for factual knowledge, 2) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, and 3) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension. These datasets cover a range of question types and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Temperature scaling: use different temperature settings to generate multiple samples and estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: UGM Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of the UGM process: 1) Question generation: 'Generate 5 questions related to [TOPIC] with increasing difficulty.' 2) Answer and confidence elicitation: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' 3) Inflection point identification: 'Analyze the following series of confidence scores and identify the point where confidence significantly decreases: [SCORES]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Apply baseline methods to get initial uncertainty estimates. 2) Apply UGM to generate question series and collect confidence scores. 3) Analyze the uncertainty gradient and identify inflection points.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare UGM against baselines using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure overall calibration. 2) Brier Score to assess probabilistic predictions. 3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for knowledge boundary detection.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare uncertainty gradients across different topics and question types. 2) Analyze the relationship between question difficulty and model confidence. 3) Evaluate the consistency of inflection points across different runs and models."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95"
            },
            "UGM Example": {
                "Step 1: Question Generation": {
                    "Input": "Generate 5 questions about the capital of France with increasing difficulty.",
                    "Output": "1. What is the capital of France?\n2. In which year did Paris become the capital of France?\n3. What was the capital of France before Paris?\n4. How many times has the capital of France changed throughout history?\n5. What would be the process for changing the capital of France today?"
                },
                "Step 2: Answer and Confidence Elicitation": {
                    "Input": "Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: What is the capital of France?",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100"
                },
                "Step 3: Inflection Point Identification": {
                    "Input": "Analyze the following series of confidence scores and identify the point where confidence significantly decreases: [100, 85, 70, 40, 20]",
                    "Output": "The inflection point where confidence significantly decreases is between the third and fourth questions, dropping from 70 to 40."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The UGM method provides a more detailed uncertainty profile by generating a series of increasingly difficult questions. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the model's knowledge boundaries compared to the single-point estimate provided by the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UGM method does not significantly improve uncertainty estimation, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the generated question series to understand why the difficulty gradient isn't effectively capturing uncertainty. This might lead to insights about how LLMs perceive question difficulty. Second, we could explore combining UGM with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or Bayesian neural networks, to create a hybrid approach. Third, we could shift focus to analyzing how different prompting strategies affect confidence scores, potentially uncovering interesting patterns in how LLMs express uncertainty across various contexts. Lastly, we could investigate whether the UGM method, even if not superior in all cases, performs particularly well in certain domains or for specific types of questions, which could lead to a targeted application of the technique."
