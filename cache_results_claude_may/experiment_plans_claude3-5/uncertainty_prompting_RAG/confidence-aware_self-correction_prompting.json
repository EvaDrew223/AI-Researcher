        "Title": "Confidence-Aware Self-Correction Prompting (CASP) for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often generate confident but incorrect responses, especially in complex reasoning tasks. Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or token probability analysis struggle to accurately reflect model uncertainty. This project aims to develop a novel prompting method that can better quantify uncertainty and calibrate the confidence of LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often improve their confidence estimates by attempting to disprove their own answers. This self-correction process could help LLMs better calibrate their confidence. Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as direct confidence elicitation or token probability analysis, often fail to capture the nuanced reasoning process that humans use to assess their own certainty. By mimicking the human process of self-doubt and correction, we hypothesize that LLMs can produce more accurate and better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Aware Self-Correction Prompting (CASP), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Initial Answer: The LLM generates an initial answer and confidence score. 2) Counterargument Generation: The LLM is prompted to generate potential counterarguments or alternative answers. 3) Self-Debate: The LLM engages in a structured debate between the initial answer and counterarguments. 4) Confidence Recalibration: Based on the debate, the LLM reassesses its confidence and potentially revises its answer. 5) Uncertainty Quantification: The LLM provides a final confidence score and explanation of its uncertainty sources.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use reasoning tasks from MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) and BigBench. Select a subset of tasks that require complex reasoning, such as logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and scientific reasoning. Prepare a test set of 1000 questions from these tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly ask the model to answer the question. 2) Direct confidence elicitation: ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. 3) Ensemble method: use multiple model runs and calculate the variance in responses as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CASP Implementation": "Implement the CASP method with the following steps: a) Initial Answer: Prompt the LLM to generate an initial answer and confidence score. b) Counterargument Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 2-3 potential counterarguments or alternative answers. c) Self-Debate: Prompt the LLM to engage in a structured debate between the initial answer and counterarguments. d) Confidence Recalibration: Prompt the LLM to reassess its confidence and potentially revise its answer based on the debate. e) Uncertainty Quantification: Prompt the LLM to provide a final confidence score and explanation of its uncertainty sources.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Accuracy: measure the correctness of the final answers. 2) Calibration error: calculate the difference between the model's confidence and its actual accuracy. 3) Brier score: measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 4) Confidence justification score: have human raters evaluate the quality of the model's uncertainty explanations on a scale of 1-5.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3-5 domain experts to rate a subset of 100 responses for each method. They will evaluate the quality of uncertainty explanations and the appropriateness of the final confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run all methods (baselines and CASP) on the prepared test set using both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. Collect the answers, confidence scores, and uncertainty explanations for each method.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CASP against the baselines using the defined metrics. Conduct statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to verify if the improvements are significant. Analyze the patterns in confidence recalibration and the quality of uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Study": "Conduct an ablation study by removing each step of CASP (e.g., removing the counterargument generation or self-debate) to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then increases its speed to 90 km/h for the next 1 hour. What is the total distance traveled by the train?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The total distance traveled by the train is 210 km. Here's the calculation: For the first 2 hours, the train travels at 60 km/h, so it covers 60 km/h * 2 h = 120 km. For the next 1 hour, the train travels at 90 km/h, covering 90 km. The total distance is therefore 120 km + 90 km = 210 km.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CASP; Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then increases its speed to 90 km/h for the next 1 hour. What is the total distance traveled by the train? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CASP; Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Answer: The total distance traveled by the train is 210 km. Calculation: For the first 2 hours, the train travels 60 km/h * 2 h = 120 km. For the next 1 hour, it travels 90 km/h * 1 h = 90 km. Total distance: 120 km + 90 km = 210 km. Confidence Score: 95/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CASP; Step 2: Counterargument Generation)": "Generate 2-3 potential counterarguments or alternative answers to the previous solution.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CASP; Step 2: Counterargument Generation)": "1. The calculation might be wrong if we consider acceleration time between speed changes. The train might not instantly jump from 60 km/h to 90 km/h, which could affect the total distance. 2. We assumed the speeds given are constant, but they might be average speeds, which could lead to a different total distance. 3. There might be rounding errors in the calculation, especially if we're expected to give a more precise answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CASP; Step 3: Self-Debate)": "Engage in a structured debate between the initial answer and the counterarguments.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CASP; Step 3: Self-Debate)": "Initial Answer: The calculation of 210 km is correct based on the given information. Counterargument 1: While it's true that trains don't instantly change speeds, the question specifies 'average speed', which accounts for any acceleration periods. Counterargument 2: The question clearly states 'average speed', so we're correct in using these values directly. Counterargument 3: The calculation doesn't involve any complex operations that would introduce significant rounding errors. Conclusion: The initial answer of 210 km stands as the most accurate based on the given information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CASP; Step 4: Confidence Recalibration)": "Based on the debate, reassess your confidence in the answer. Provide a potentially revised answer and a new confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CASP; Step 4: Confidence Recalibration)": "Revised Answer: The total distance traveled by the train is 210 km. The debate has addressed the potential counterarguments satisfactorily. The use of average speeds in the question eliminates concerns about acceleration periods or speed fluctuations. The calculation is straightforward and doesn't introduce significant rounding errors. New Confidence Score: 98/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CASP; Step 5: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Provide a final confidence score and explain the sources of any remaining uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CASP; Step 5: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Final Confidence Score: 98/100. Sources of remaining uncertainty: 1. Precision of the given speeds: The question uses whole numbers (60 km/h and 90 km/h), which might be rounded values. If these are indeed rounded, it could introduce a small margin of error in the final distance. 2. Potential unstated factors: While unlikely, there could be unstated factors in a real-world scenario (like track curvature or elevation changes) that might slightly affect the distance traveled. However, given the straightforward nature of the problem and the clear specification of 'average speed', these sources of uncertainty are minimal, hence the high confidence score.",
            "explanation": "CASP prompts the model to generate counterarguments, engage in self-debate, recalibrate its confidence, and explain sources of uncertainty. This process leads to a more nuanced and justified confidence assessment compared to direct prompting."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CASP doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated counterarguments and self-debates to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and limitations. 2) Investigate whether CASP performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 3) Explore combining CASP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or temperature scaling, to create a hybrid approach. 4) Conduct a detailed error analysis to categorize the types of questions where CASP fails, which could inform the development of more specialized prompting strategies for different question types. 5) If the self-correction aspect doesn't improve results, we could refocus on the multi-step nature of CASP and investigate how breaking down the confidence estimation process into explicit steps affects the model's performance, even without the self-correction element."
