        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence when reasoning by analogy, leading to either overconfidence in faulty analogies or underconfidence in valid ones. This issue hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in tasks that benefit from analogical reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on general uncertainty estimation without specifically addressing the unique challenges of analogical reasoning. Analogical reasoning is a powerful tool for human problem-solving and explanation. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty in each step of analogical reasoning, we can potentially achieve more accurate and interpretable confidence calibration. This method leverages the LLM's own capabilities to generate, evaluate, and refine analogies, potentially leading to better performance on tasks that benefit from analogical thinking.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Analogical Reasoning (CCAR), a multi-step prompting approach: 1) Analogy Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple potential analogies for the given query. 2) Structural Mapping: For each analogy, guide the model to explicitly map the structural relationships between the source and target domains. 3) Confidence Scoring: Prompt the model to assign confidence scores to each mapped relationship, considering factors like similarity, relevance, and potential disanalogies. 4) Analogy Evaluation: Based on the structural mapping and confidence scores, prompt the model to evaluate the overall strength and applicability of each analogy. 5) Uncertainty Synthesis: Synthesize an overall uncertainty estimate for the query, taking into account the strength of the best analogies, the diversity of generated analogies, and the model's confidence in its analogical reasoning process. 6) Meta-Analogical Reflection: Finally, prompt the model to reflect on its use of analogy for this query, potentially adjusting its uncertainty estimate based on past performance with similar types of analogical reasoning.",

            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the query. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use the 'Let's think step by step' prompt. 3) Standard uncertainty estimation: Use the approach from Calibrate Before Use: Improving Few-Shot Performance of Language Models.",
            "Step 3: CCAR Implementation": "Implement the CCAR method with the following prompts for each step: 1) Analogy Generation: 'Generate three distinct analogies that could help answer the following question: [QUERY]' 2) Structural Mapping: 'For each analogy, identify the key elements and relationships in both the source and target domains. Map these elements explicitly.' 3) Confidence Scoring: 'Assign a confidence score (0-100) to each mapped relationship. Consider similarity, relevance, and potential disanalogies.' 4) Analogy Evaluation: 'Evaluate the overall strength and applicability of each analogy based on the structural mapping and confidence scores.' 5) Uncertainty Synthesis: 'Provide an overall uncertainty estimate for the answer to the original query. Consider the strength of the best analogies, the diversity of generated analogies, and your confidence in the analogical reasoning process.' 6) Meta-Analogical Reflection: 'Reflect on your use of analogy for this query. How might this affect your uncertainty estimate?'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Answer Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration Error: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure the difference between confidence and accuracy. 3) Analogy Quality: Human evaluation of a subset of generated analogies (relevance, creativity, insightfulness on a 1-5 scale). 4) Uncertainty Resolution: Spearman correlation between model uncertainty and human-judged difficulty of questions.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: 1) Run baseline methods and collect results. 2) Run CCAR method and collect results. 3) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and CCAR.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare CCAR performance against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze the quality and diversity of generated analogies. 3) Examine how uncertainty estimates correlate with answer correctness and human-judged question difficulty. 4) Investigate cases where CCAR significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: How does the structure of a cell membrane relate to its function?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The cell membrane's structure relates to its function through its phospholipid bilayer and embedded proteins. The phospholipid bilayer allows selective permeability, controlling what enters and exits the cell. Embedded proteins act as channels, receptors, and enzymes, facilitating specific functions like transport and cell signaling.",

This analogy is highly applicable as it captures the key aspects of selective permeability and the role of membrane proteins. The high confidence scores across all mappings indicate a strong structural similarity.\n\n2. Coffee Filter: Overall strength 83/100. This analogy is quite applicable, especially in illustrating the concept of selective permeability. However, it's slightly weaker in representing the complexity of membrane proteins and their functions.\n\n3. Gated Community: Overall strength 80/100. This analogy is moderately strong, with good representations of selective permeability and different protein functions. However, it's slightly less intuitive than the airport analogy and has lower confidence scores for some mappings.",

Confidence in analogical reasoning: The structural mappings and confidence scores show a consistent and logical approach to analyzing the analogies.\n4. Consistency across analogies: All three analogies emphasize the key concept of selective permeability, reinforcing its importance.\n5.

            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCAR; Step 6: Meta-Analogical Reflection)": "Reflect on your use of analogy for this query. How might this affect your uncertainty estimate?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCAR; Step 6: Meta-Analogical Reflection)": "Reflection on the use of analogy for this query:\n\n1. Strengths:\n   - The analogies effectively illustrate the key concept of selective permeability.\n   - They provide concrete, relatable examples that make the abstract concept more understandable.\n   - The diversity of analogies helps cover different aspects of the cell membrane's structure and function.\n\n2. Limitations:\n   - The analogies may oversimplify some of the complex molecular interactions in the cell membrane.\n   - They don't fully capture the dynamic, fluid nature of the phospholipid bilayer.\n   - The analogies focus more on function than on the detailed molecular structure.\n\n3. Impact on uncertainty estimate:\n   - The strong consistency across analogies in representing selective permeability increases confidence in this key aspect.\n   - The limitations in representing molecular-level details slightly increase uncertainty.\n   - The use of multiple, diverse analogies helps reduce overall uncertainty by providing a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would maintain the uncertainty estimate at 15%. While the analogies are strong and consistent in representing key concepts, the acknowledged limitations prevent further reduction in uncertainty without delving into more technical, molecular-level explanations.",
            "explanation": "The CCAR method provides a more nuanced and well-reasoned response compared to direct prompting. It generates multiple analogies, evaluates their strengths and weaknesses, and provides a calibrated uncertainty estimate. This process allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the concept and a more accurate assessment of the model's confidence in its answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCAR method doesn't significantly improve performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated analogies, their structural mappings, and confidence scores to understand where the method falls short. This could provide insights into the model's analogical reasoning capabilities and limitations. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from CCAR than others, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the method. 3) Explore variations of the CCAR method, such as iterative refinement of analogies based on the meta-analogical reflection, or incorporating external knowledge to guide analogy generation. 4) Analyze the relationship between the diversity of generated analogies and the accuracy of the final answer, which could lead to insights about the role of diverse perspectives in problem-solving. 5) Compare the uncertainty estimates from CCAR with those from other uncertainty estimation methods to understand the unique contributions of analogical reasoning to confidence calibration. These alternative directions could transform the project into an insightful analysis of analogical reasoning in LLMs, even if the original performance improvements are not achieved."
