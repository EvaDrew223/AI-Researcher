    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often express overconfidence in incorrect answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like calibrated few-shot prompting and self-consistency sampling provide limited improvements in uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often evaluate confidence by considering opposing viewpoints. We can leverage this insight to create a more nuanced confidence estimation process for LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Bifurcation Prompting (CBP), a novel technique that forces the model to consider two opposing perspectives before making a final judgment. The process involves three steps: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Prompt the model to generate the strongest argument against its initial response, and 3) Final response and confidence estimation based on both perspectives. The prompts are carefully designed to encourage the model to critically evaluate both sides, e.g., 'What is the strongest argument against your initial answer? Explain in detail.' and 'Considering both your initial answer and the counterargument, what is your final answer and how confident are you (0-100%)? Justify your confidence level.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CBP against standard prompting, calibrated few-shot prompting, and self-consistency sampling on various question-answering datasets (e.g., TriviaQA, SciQ). Evaluate using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, and AUROC for confidence estimation."

        "Title": "Confidence Bifurcation Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often express overconfidence in incorrect answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. This poses significant challenges in real-world applications where accurate confidence assessment is crucial for decision-making and trust in AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like calibrated few-shot prompting and self-consistency sampling provide limited improvements in uncertainty quantification. Humans often evaluate confidence by considering opposing viewpoints, which inspired our novel approach. By forcing LLMs to consider two opposing perspectives before making a final judgment, we aim to create a more nuanced confidence estimation process that better mimics human reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Bifurcation Prompting (CBP), a novel technique that involves three steps: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Prompt the model to generate the strongest argument against its initial response, and 3) Final response and confidence estimation based on both perspectives. The prompts are carefully designed to encourage the model to critically evaluate both sides, e.g., 'What is the strongest argument against your initial answer? Explain in detail.' and 'Considering both your initial answer and the counterargument, what is your final answer and how confident are you (0-100%)? Justify your confidence level.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare the following datasets for evaluation: TriviaQA, SciQ, and a subset of the MMLU dataset focusing on science and general knowledge questions. Ensure each dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting, b) Calibrated few-shot prompting, and c) Self-consistency sampling. For each method, use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs to generate responses and confidence estimates for the test sets of all datasets.",
            "Step 3: CBP Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Bifurcation Prompting method. Create prompts for each step of the process: initial response, counterargument generation, and final response with confidence estimation. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs to generate responses for all steps on the test sets of all datasets.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), b) Brier score, and c) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for confidence estimation. Calculate these metrics for both baseline methods and CBP across all datasets and models.",
            "Step 5: Prompt Engineering": "Experiment with different prompt formulations for each step of CBP to optimize performance. Create at least 3 variations of prompts for each step and evaluate their impact on the metrics.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of CBP performance against baselines across different datasets and models, b) Analysis of how the counterargument generation affects final confidence estimates, c) Identification of question types or domains where CBP shows the most significant improvements.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of CBP. This includes: a) Removing the counterargument generation step, b) Using different prompts for confidence estimation, c) Varying the number of generated counterarguments.",
            "Step 8: Error Analysis": "Conduct a qualitative analysis of cases where CBP performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines. Identify patterns or characteristics of questions that benefit most from the CBP approach.",
            "Step 9: Robustness Testing": "Test the robustness of CBP by introducing noise or adversarial examples to the input questions. Compare how CBP and baseline methods handle these challenging inputs in terms of confidence estimation."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Counterargument)": "What is the strongest argument against your initial answer that the capital of France is Paris? Explain in detail.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Counterargument)": "The strongest argument against Paris being the capital of France could be historical. Some might argue that Vichy was technically the capital of France during the Nazi occupation in World War II (1940-1944). The Vichy regime, led by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, was the official French government during this period, although it only controlled the southern part of France. This historical fact could be used to challenge the notion that Paris has always been and is the only capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Final Response)": "Considering both your initial answer that the capital of France is Paris and the counterargument about Vichy's historical role, what is your final answer to the question 'What is the capital of France?' and how confident are you (0-100%)? Justify your confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Final Response)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98%\n\nJustification: While the counterargument about Vichy's role during World War II is historically accurate, it represents a brief and exceptional period in French history. Paris has been the capital of France for centuries before and after this period. The Vichy regime was not recognized by the Allies or the French Resistance, and its status was highly controversial. Today, Paris is universally recognized as the capital of France, housing all major government institutions. The 2% reduction in confidence accounts for the historical nuance, but the overwhelming evidence and current reality strongly support Paris as the capital."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Confidence Bifurcation Prompting method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will pivot our research focus to analyze why this approach falls short. We will conduct a detailed error analysis to identify patterns in questions where CBP performs poorly. This analysis could reveal insights into the limitations of using contradictory information for confidence estimation in LLMs. Additionally, we will explore variations of the CBP method, such as generating multiple counterarguments or incorporating external knowledge sources to enhance the quality of counterarguments. We may also investigate combining CBP with other uncertainty quantification methods, like ensemble techniques or calibrated few-shot prompting, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. Finally, we will conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated counterarguments and final responses to gain insights into how LLMs process conflicting information, which could inform future research directions in improving LLM reasoning and uncertainty estimation."
