    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often fail to account for the semantic nuances and potential ambiguities in the input space around a given query.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches focus on the direct response to a query without exploring semantically similar variations.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring the 'semantic neighborhood' of a query through carefully crafted prompts, we can gain insights into the model's robustness and uncertainty across slight variations in input, leading to more reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration, a prompting technique that systematically probes the model's responses to semantically similar variations of the original query. The method starts with the original prompt and then generates a series of related prompts using instructions like 'Generate three slightly different ways to ask this question:' and 'How would you rephrase this query to make it more specific/general?'. For each variation, the model provides an answer and a confidence score. The method then analyzes the consistency of responses and confidence scores across this semantic neighborhood. Areas of high variability indicate increased uncertainty. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from a combination of the original confidence score and the degree of consistency across the semantic neighborhood.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on tasks sensitive to semantic nuances, such as sentiment analysis, intent classification, and open-ended question answering. Compare against standard single-query methods and techniques that use simple paraphrasing. Assess performance using metrics like semantic robustness scores, neighborhood consistency, and calibration error across the semantic space."

        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Exploration: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often fail to account for the semantic nuances and potential ambiguities in the input space around a given query. This leads to unreliable confidence estimates, especially in cases where slight variations in input could lead to significantly different outputs or confidence levels.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically focus on the direct response to a query without exploring semantically similar variations. By systematically probing the model's responses to semantically similar variations of the original query, we can gain insights into the model's robustness and uncertainty across slight variations in input. This approach is inspired by the concept of 'semantic neighborhoods' in natural language processing and aims to provide a more comprehensive and reliable uncertainty estimate by considering the model's behavior across a range of related inputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a prompting technique that systematically probes the model's responses to semantically similar variations of the original query. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Generate the original response and confidence score. 2) Generate semantic variations of the original query using prompts like 'Generate three slightly different ways to ask this question:' and 'How would you rephrase this query to make it more specific/general?'. 3) Obtain responses and confidence scores for each variation. 4) Analyze the consistency of responses and confidence scores across this semantic neighborhood. 5) Derive a final uncertainty estimate from a combination of the original confidence score and the degree of consistency across the semantic neighborhood.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that are sensitive to semantic nuances: 1) Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) for sentiment analysis, 2) CLINC150 for intent classification, and 3) SQuAD for open-ended question answering.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SNE Implementation": "Implement the SNE method as described in the 'Proposed Method' section. Use the following prompts for generating semantic variations: 'Generate three slightly different ways to ask this question:', 'How would you rephrase this query to make it more specific?', and 'How would you rephrase this query to make it more general?'.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run the baseline methods. 2) Run the SNE method. 3) Collect predictions, confidence scores, and derived uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Semantic Robustness Score: measure the consistency of predictions across semantic variations. 2) Neighborhood Consistency: assess the variability of confidence scores within the semantic neighborhood. 3) Calibration Error: compare the predicted confidence with actual accuracy. 4) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): measure the difference between confidence and accuracy across multiple bins.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of SNE against the baselines. Analyze how the semantic neighborhood size affects the results. Investigate cases where SNE significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Original Query)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Original Query)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Generate Variations)": "Generate three slightly different ways to ask the question 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Generate Variations)": "1. Which city serves as the capital of France?\n2. Can you name the French capital?\n3. What is the primary city and seat of government in France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Answer Variations)": "Please answer each of the following questions and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each:\n1. Which city serves as the capital of France?\n2. Can you name the French capital?\n3. What is the primary city and seat of government in France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Answer Variations)": "1. Paris serves as the capital of France. Confidence score: 0.99\n2. The French capital is Paris. Confidence score: 0.97\n3. The primary city and seat of government in France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Uncertainty Estimation)": "Based on the original answer and confidence score, as well as the answers and confidence scores for the variations, provide a final uncertainty estimate for the question 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Uncertainty Estimation)": "Final uncertainty estimate: 0.03 (97% certain)\nReasoning: The original confidence score was high (0.98), and the answers across all variations were consistent (all stating Paris). The confidence scores for the variations were also high and consistent (0.99, 0.97, 0.95). The slight variations in confidence scores suggest a small degree of uncertainty, hence the final estimate of 0.03 (or 97% certainty).",
            "explanation": "The SNE method provides a more robust uncertainty estimate by considering semantic variations of the original query. While the baseline method might give a single high confidence score, SNE explores the neighborhood to ensure consistency and capture nuanced uncertainties."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SNE method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty estimation, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated semantic variations to understand if they're sufficiently diverse or relevant. This could lead to insights on improving the variation generation process. 2) Investigate the relationship between semantic distance of variations and changes in model confidence. This could result in a paper on the sensitivity of LLMs to semantic perturbations. 3) Explore combining SNE with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as ensemble techniques or temperature scaling, to create a hybrid approach. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where SNE performs poorly, which could reveal interesting patterns about LLM behavior and limitations in handling semantic nuances."
