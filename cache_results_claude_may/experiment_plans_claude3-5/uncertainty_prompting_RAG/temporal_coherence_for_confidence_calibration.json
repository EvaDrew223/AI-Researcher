        "Problem": "LLMs often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when answering related questions over time, failing to maintain coherent uncertainty across a conversation or reasoning chain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches treat each query independently, ignoring the temporal aspect of confidence in extended interactions.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence exhibits temporal coherence, with uncertainty evolving logically as new information is presented or reasoning progresses. Enforcing similar coherence in LLMs could lead to more reliable and interpretable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence for Confidence Calibration (TC3): 1) Conversation History Tracking: Maintain a structured representation of the conversation, including previous questions, answers, and confidence scores. 2) Confidence Trajectory Modeling: Prompt the LLM to explicitly model how its confidence should evolve based on the conversation history and new information. 3) Coherence Constraints: Introduce soft constraints that encourage smooth and justifiable changes in confidence over time. 4) Retroactive Calibration: Periodically prompt the LLM to revisit and potentially adjust earlier confidence estimates in light of subsequent information. 5) Meta-Commentary Generation: Require the LLM to provide ongoing commentary on how and why its confidence is changing throughout the conversation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TC3 on extended reasoning tasks and multi-turn question-answering scenarios. Compare against independent query methods and simple history-aware baselines. Introduce novel metrics for temporal confidence coherence and justification quality. Conduct user studies to assess the interpretability and perceived reliability of the evolving confidence estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence for Confidence Calibration (TC3): Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when answering related questions over time, failing to maintain coherent uncertainty across a conversation or reasoning chain. This inconsistency can lead to unreliable and potentially misleading outputs, especially in extended interactions or multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence calibration in LLMs typically treat each query independently, ignoring the temporal aspect of confidence in extended interactions. However, human confidence exhibits temporal coherence, with uncertainty evolving logically as new information is presented or reasoning progresses. By enforcing similar coherence in LLMs, we can potentially achieve more reliable and interpretable confidence estimates, leading to improved decision-making in AI-assisted tasks and better alignment with human-like reasoning patterns.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence for Confidence Calibration (TC3), a novel prompting method that aims to improve the consistency and reliability of LLM confidence estimates over time. TC3 consists of five key components: 1) Conversation History Tracking: Maintain a structured representation of the conversation, including previous questions, answers, and confidence scores. 2) Confidence Trajectory Modeling: Prompt the LLM to explicitly model how its confidence should evolve based on the conversation history and new information. 3) Coherence Constraints: Introduce soft constraints that encourage smooth and justifiable changes in confidence over time. 4) Retroactive Calibration: Periodically prompt the LLM to revisit and potentially adjust earlier confidence estimates in light of subsequent information. 5) Meta-Commentary Generation: Require the LLM to provide ongoing commentary on how and why its confidence is changing throughout the conversation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate TC3: 1) MultiWOZ: A multi-domain dialogue dataset for task-oriented conversations. 2) QuAC: A dataset for question answering in context, simulating information-seeking dialogues. 3) MATH: A dataset of mathematics problems, which we'll adapt into multi-turn conversations by breaking down complex problems into steps.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Independent Query: Treat each question independently and ask the LLM to provide an answer and confidence score for each. 2) Simple History: Provide the full conversation history but don't explicitly prompt for confidence coherence. 3) Static CoT: Use chain-of-thought prompting with a static confidence estimation step at the end.",
            "Step 3: TC3 Implementation": "Implement the TC3 method with the following steps: 1) Conversation History Tracking: Create a prompt template that includes a structured representation of the conversation history. 2) Confidence Trajectory Modeling: Develop a prompt that asks the LLM to predict how its confidence might change given new information. 3) Coherence Constraints: Design soft constraints in natural language, prompting the LLM to justify significant changes in confidence. 4) Retroactive Calibration: Implement a periodic review prompt that asks the LLM to reconsider earlier confidence estimates. 5) Meta-Commentary Generation: Create a prompt that asks the LLM to explain its confidence changes throughout the conversation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Confidence Calibration Error (CCE): Measure the discrepancy between confidence estimates and actual performance. 2) Temporal Consistency Score (TCS): A new metric that quantifies the smoothness and justifiability of confidence changes over time. 3) Answer Accuracy: Evaluate the correctness of the model's answers. 4) Human Evaluation: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the perceived reliability and interpretability of the confidence estimates.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run the baseline methods and collect results. 2) Run the TC3 method and collect results. 3) Calculate all evaluation metrics for both baselines and TC3. 4) Conduct statistical significance tests to compare TC3 with baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare TC3 performance against baselines across all metrics and datasets. 2) Analyze the generated meta-commentary to understand how the model justifies its confidence changes. 3) Investigate cases where TC3 significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. 4) Examine the impact of conversation length on the effectiveness of TC3."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Independent Query)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: Paris\nConfidence: 95%\n\nQ: What is the population of Paris?\nA: The population of Paris is approximately 2.2 million people.\nConfidence: 80%\n\nQ: How many arrondissements are there in Paris?\n\nProvide an answer and a confidence score for the last question.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Independent Query)": "A: There are 20 arrondissements in Paris.\nConfidence: 90%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TC3)": "Conversation History:\nQ1: What is the capital of France?\nA1: Paris\nConfidence: 95%\nExplanation: This is a well-known fact that I'm very confident about.\n\nQ2: What is the population of Paris?\nA2: The population of Paris is approximately 2.2 million people.\nConfidence: 80%\nExplanation: I'm fairly confident about this figure, but populations can change and there might be some variation depending on how the city limits are defined.\n\nQ3: How many arrondissements are there in Paris?\n\nPlease provide an answer, a confidence score, and an explanation for your confidence level. Consider how your confidence in this answer relates to your previous answers and explain any changes in your confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TC3)": "A3: There are 20 arrondissements in Paris.\nConfidence: 98%\nExplanation: I'm extremely confident about this answer. My confidence has increased compared to the previous questions because this is a fixed, well-established fact about Paris's administrative structure. It's directly related to the city's organization, which I'm very familiar with given my high confidence in identifying Paris as the capital of France. The number of arrondissements doesn't change over time like population figures might, so I can be even more certain about this than the population estimate.",
            "Explanation": "The TC3 method prompts the model to consider its previous confidence levels and explicitly reason about how and why its confidence might change. This results in a more coherent and justifiable confidence trajectory across related questions. The model not only provides a confidence score but also explains the reasoning behind it, taking into account the relationship between the current question and previous ones in the conversation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TC3 does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate whether the model is struggling with the meta-cognitive task of reasoning about its own confidence, or if the prompts are too complex and leading to confusion. We might then simplify the TC3 method, perhaps focusing on just one or two components (e.g., Confidence Trajectory Modeling and Meta-Commentary Generation) to isolate their effects. Additionally, we could analyze the generated explanations to gain insights into how the model perceives its own confidence, which could lead to a paper on the limitations of current LLMs in meta-cognitive tasks. Another direction could be to explore how different types of questions or domains affect the model's ability to maintain coherent confidence estimates, potentially uncovering interesting patterns in the model's behavior across various tasks."
