        "Problem": "Current chain-of-thought prompting methods don't explicitly capture uncertainty in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to overconfident final conclusions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Standard chain-of-thought prompting focuses on generating a sequence of reasoning steps without quantifying uncertainty at each step.",

The prompt structure is: 1) 'Reason step-by-step, assigning a probability to each conclusion. Format: Step N: [Reasoning] => [Conclusion] (Probability: X%)'. 2) After completing the chain, prompt: 'Based on the probabilities in your reasoning chain, what is your final confidence in the answer?'. This method encourages the model to explicitly consider uncertainty at each step and how it compounds through the reasoning process.",

        "Title": "Probabilistic Chain-of-Thought (PCoT): Quantifying Uncertainty in Multi-Step Reasoning",
        "Problem Statement": "Current chain-of-thought prompting methods don't explicitly capture uncertainty in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to overconfident final conclusions. This project aims to develop a novel prompting method that can better quantify uncertainty and calibrate the confidence of large language models in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting focuses on generating a sequence of reasoning steps without quantifying uncertainty at each step. By incorporating probabilistic reasoning into the CoT process, we can better track and propagate uncertainty through complex reasoning tasks. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often assign degrees of confidence to intermediate conclusions. PCoT could lead to more reliable and interpretable outputs from language models, especially in high-stakes domains where understanding model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Probabilistic Chain-of-Thought (PCoT), which extends standard CoT by prompting the model to assign probabilities to each intermediate conclusion. The method consists of two main steps: 1) Reasoning with probabilities: We prompt the model to reason step-by-step, assigning a probability to each conclusion. The prompt structure is: 'Reason step-by-step, assigning a probability to each conclusion. Format: Step N: [Reasoning] => [Conclusion] (Probability: X%)'. 2) Final confidence estimation: After completing the chain, we prompt: 'Based on the probabilities in your reasoning chain, what is your final confidence in the answer?'. This method encourages the model to explicitly consider uncertainty at each step and how it compounds through the reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K (for math word problems) and MATH (for more advanced mathematical reasoning). For each dataset, randomly select 1000 examples for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baselines: 1) Direct prompting (just asking the question), 2) Standard Chain-of-Thought prompting, and 3) Self-consistency method (which generates multiple CoT samples and takes a majority vote).",
            "Step 4: PCoT Implementation": "Implement the PCoT method as described in the 'Proposed Method' section. Use few-shot prompting with 2-3 examples to demonstrate the desired format.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each method (baselines and PCoT), generate answers for all examples in the evaluation sets. Measure: 1) Accuracy: percentage of correct final answers, 2) Calibration: compare the model's reported confidence with its empirical accuracy, 3) Uncertainty correlation: analyze how intermediate probabilities correlate with final confidence and accuracy.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform qualitative analysis on a subset of examples to understand how PCoT affects the reasoning process. Compare the reasoning chains and confidence estimates between standard CoT and PCoT.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of PCoT. For example, test a version without explicit final confidence estimation, or vary the number of reasoning steps."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard CoT)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Let's approach this step-by-step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard CoT)": "1) First, let's identify the key information:\n   - Distance traveled = 120 miles\n   - Time taken = 2 hours\n\n2) The formula for average speed is:\n   Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\n3) Let's plug in our values:\n   Average Speed = 120 miles / 2 hours\n\n4) Now we can calculate:\n   Average Speed = 60 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the train's average speed is 60 miles per hour.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PCoT)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Reason step-by-step, assigning a probability to each conclusion. Format: Step N: [Reasoning] => [Conclusion] (Probability: X%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PCoT)": "Step 1: [The question provides the distance traveled (120 miles) and the time taken (2 hours). These are straightforward facts from the problem statement.] => The train traveled 120 miles in 2 hours. (Probability: 100%)\n\nStep 2: [The formula for average speed is Distance / Time. This is a fundamental physics equation.] => We need to divide 120 miles by 2 hours to find the average speed. (Probability: 99%)\n\nStep 3: [Performing the division: 120 / 2 = 60. This is a simple arithmetic operation.] => The average speed is 60 miles per hour. (Probability: 98%)\n\nStep 4: [The question asks for the speed in miles per hour, which is exactly what we calculated.] => The final answer is 60 miles per hour. (Probability: 97%)\n\nBased on the probabilities in the reasoning chain, my final confidence in the answer is 97%.",
            "Explanation": "PCoT provides explicit probability estimates for each step, allowing us to track the model's confidence throughout the reasoning process. The final confidence (97%) reflects the compounded uncertainty from each step. This approach gives us more insight into the model's reasoning and allows us to identify steps where the model is less certain."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PCoT doesn't significantly improve performance or calibration compared to baselines, we can explore several directions: 1) Analyze the assigned probabilities to understand if the model is struggling with probability estimation. We might need to refine our prompting strategy or provide more guidance on probability assignment. 2) Investigate whether the model is propagating uncertainty correctly. We could design specific test cases to check this and potentially modify our method to improve uncertainty propagation. 3) Explore combining PCoT with other techniques, such as self-consistency or calibration methods, to see if we can achieve better results. 4) If the results are interesting but not clearly superior, we could pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on how different types of reasoning tasks affect the model's ability to estimate and propagate uncertainty. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current language models in probabilistic reasoning."
