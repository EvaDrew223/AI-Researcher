    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that require multiple steps of reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like chain-of-thought prompting or self-consistency sampling do not explicitly model uncertainty propagation through multi-step reasoning processes.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically branching the reasoning process based on uncertainty at each step, we can better capture and propagate uncertainty through complex reasoning chains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Branching (UPB), a novel prompting method that dynamically constructs a tree of reasoning paths. At each step, the model is prompted to 1) provide an intermediate reasoning step, 2) estimate its confidence in that step, and 3) generate multiple alternative paths if confidence is low. This process continues recursively, creating a tree structure. The final answer is derived by aggregating across paths, weighted by confidence scores. Prompts are carefully designed to elicit honest uncertainty estimates and encourage exploration of diverse reasoning paths.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UPB against standard prompting, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency methods on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH. We'll measure not only task performance, but also calibration metrics like expected calibration error (ECE) and Brier score."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Branching: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that require multiple steps of reasoning. This leads to overconfident predictions on incorrect answers and poor calibration, which can be problematic in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like chain-of-thought prompting or self-consistency sampling do not explicitly model uncertainty propagation through multi-step reasoning processes. By dynamically branching the reasoning process based on uncertainty at each step, we can better capture and propagate uncertainty through complex reasoning chains. This approach is inspired by how humans often consider multiple possibilities when uncertain, exploring different lines of reasoning before arriving at a final answer.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Branching (UPB), a novel prompting method that dynamically constructs a tree of reasoning paths. At each step, the model is prompted to: 1) provide an intermediate reasoning step, 2) estimate its confidence in that step, and 3) generate multiple alternative paths if confidence is low. This process continues recursively, creating a tree structure. The final answer is derived by aggregating across paths, weighted by confidence scores. Prompts are carefully designed to elicit honest uncertainty estimates and encourage exploration of diverse reasoning paths.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. Both datasets contain multi-step reasoning problems that are suitable for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement and evaluate three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting, 2) Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and 3) Self-consistency sampling. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for all experiments.",
            "Step 3: UPB Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Branching method. This involves designing prompts for each step of the process:\na) Intermediate reasoning step generation\nb) Confidence estimation\nc) Alternative path generation\nd) Aggregation of multiple paths\nUse few-shot examples to demonstrate the desired format for each step.",
            "Step 4: Hyperparameter Tuning": "Tune key hyperparameters of UPB, including:\na) Confidence threshold for branching (e.g., branch if confidence < 0.7)\nb) Maximum branching factor (e.g., generate up to 3 alternative paths)\nc) Maximum tree depth (e.g., limit to 5 levels of reasoning)\nUse a subset of the validation data for tuning.",
            "Step 5: Main Experiments": "Run experiments comparing UPB against the baselines on both GSM8K and MATH datasets. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for all methods. Evaluate using the following metrics:\na) Task performance (accuracy)\nb) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score\nc) Average tree depth and branching factor for UPB",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components:\na) Remove confidence estimation and branch randomly\nb) Use a fixed branching factor instead of dynamic branching\nc) Vary the aggregation method (e.g., simple averaging vs. confidence-weighted)",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results:\na) Visualize reasoning trees for representative examples\nb) Analyze correlation between model confidence and correctness\nc) Compare uncertainty estimates at different depths of the reasoning tree\nd) Identify common patterns in problems where UPB outperforms baselines"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more apples and then gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does John have now?",
                "Output (Standard Prompting)": "John has 6 apples now.",
                "Output (Chain-of-Thought)": "Let's solve this step by step:\n1. John starts with 5 apples\n2. He buys 3 more apples, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 apples\n3. He gives 2 apples to his friend, so he's left with 8 - 2 = 6 apples\nTherefore, John has 6 apples now.",
                "Output (Self-Consistency)": "[Sample 1] John has 6 apples now.\n[Sample 2] John has 6 apples now.\n[Sample 3] John has 6 apples now.\nFinal answer: John has 6 apples now."
            },
            "UPB Example": {
                "Input": "Q: A store sells shirts for $25 each. If you buy 3 shirts, you get a 20% discount on the total price. How much would you save if you bought 3 shirts?",
                "Output": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the regular price for 3 shirts:\n   3 * $25 = $75\n   Confidence: 0.95\n\n2. Calculate 20% of $75:\n   20% of $75 = 0.2 * $75 = $15\n   Confidence: 0.9\n\n3. Therefore, you would save $15 by buying 3 shirts.\n   Confidence: 0.85\n\nAlternative path (due to lower confidence):\n2a. Calculate the discounted price:\n    80% of $75 = 0.8 * $75 = $60\n    Confidence: 0.92\n\n3a. Calculate the savings:\n    $75 - $60 = $15\n    Confidence: 0.95\n\nFinal answer (aggregating both paths): You would save $15 if you bought 3 shirts.\nOverall confidence: 0.93",
                "Explanation": "UPB generates a tree of reasoning paths, branching when confidence is low. It then aggregates results from multiple paths, leading to a more robust final answer with better-calibrated confidence."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UPB doesn't significantly improve performance or calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why UPB fails and in what types of problems. This could lead to insights about the limitations of current LLMs in uncertainty estimation. Second, we could explore combining UPB with other techniques like retrieval-augmented generation or tool use, to see if external knowledge helps in better uncertainty estimation. Third, we could focus on analyzing the structure of the generated reasoning trees, which might provide insights into how LLMs approach multi-step reasoning tasks. Finally, we could turn this into a more exploratory study on how different prompting techniques affect the calibration of LLMs, comparing UPB with other recent prompting methods beyond our initial baselines."
