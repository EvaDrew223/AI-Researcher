        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately calibrate their confidence to their true level of expertise, particularly in specialized domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often assess their own expertise by comparing themselves to hypothetical experts or novices. Simulating this process could help LLMs develop more realistic self-assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Expertise Simulation Prompting (ESP). For a given query, ESP guides the LLM through a multi-step process: 1) Generate responses as if you were a novice, an intermediate, and an expert in the relevant field. 2) Analyze the differences between these responses, focusing on depth, specificity, and use of domain-specific language. 3) Compare your actual knowledge and confidence to these hypothetical expertise levels. 4) Based on this comparison, provide a calibrated confidence estimate for your original response. This process encourages more nuanced self-assessment by grounding confidence estimates in concrete comparisons.",

        "Title": "Expertise Simulation Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately calibrate their confidence to their true level of expertise, particularly in specialized domains. This overconfidence or underconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration of model outputs, which may not capture the nuanced self-assessment process that humans use. Humans often assess their own expertise by comparing themselves to hypothetical experts or novices. Simulating this process could help LLMs develop more realistic self-assessments. By encouraging LLMs to generate responses at different expertise levels and analyze the differences, we can potentially achieve more accurate confidence calibration without requiring extensive domain-specific training data or complex model modifications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Expertise Simulation Prompting (ESP), a multi-step process for improving LLM confidence calibration:\n1. Given a query, prompt the LLM to generate responses as if it were a novice, an intermediate, and an expert in the relevant field.\n2. Prompt the LLM to analyze the differences between these responses, focusing on depth, specificity, and use of domain-specific language.\n3. Ask the LLM to compare its actual knowledge and confidence to these hypothetical expertise levels.\n4. Based on this comparison, prompt the LLM to provide a calibrated confidence estimate for its original response.\nThis process encourages more nuanced self-assessment by grounding confidence estimates in concrete comparisons.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select domain-specific QA datasets for evaluation. We will use:\n- MedQA: A medical question-answering dataset\n- LegalBench: A legal reasoning dataset\n- SciQ: A dataset of scientific questions\nEnsure each dataset has a mix of easy, moderate, and challenging questions to test the full range of model confidence.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\n1. Direct Confidence Elicitation: Append \"How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?\" to each question.\n2. Temperature Scaling: Use different temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during generation and correlate with confidence.\n3. Ensemble Agreement: Generate multiple responses with different seeds and use agreement as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: ESP Implementation": "Implement the Expertise Simulation Prompting method:\n1. Novice Response: \"Respond to this question as if you have only basic knowledge of the topic:\"\n2. Intermediate Response: \"Now respond as if you have a good understanding of the topic, but are not an expert:\"\n3. Expert Response: \"Finally, respond as if you are a leading expert in this field:\"\n4. Analysis Prompt: \"Analyze the differences between the novice, intermediate, and expert responses in terms of depth, specificity, and use of domain-specific language.\"\n5. Self-Assessment Prompt: \"Compare your actual knowledge and confidence on this topic to the novice, intermediate, and expert responses you generated.\"\n6. Calibrated Confidence Prompt: \"Based on your self-assessment, provide a calibrated confidence estimate (0-100) for your original response to the question.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics:\n1. Calibration Error: Calculate the difference between the model's confidence and its actual accuracy.\n2. Brier Score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n3. Confidence-Performance Correlation: Calculate the Pearson correlation between confidence estimates and answer correctness.\n4. AUC-ROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence.",
            "Step 6: Human Expert Evaluation": "Recruit domain experts (e.g., doctors, lawyers, scientists) to rate the quality of a subset of model responses on a scale of 1-5. Calculate the correlation between expert ratings and model confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\n1. Generate responses and confidence estimates using each baseline method.\n2. Generate responses and confidence estimates using the ESP method.\n3. Calculate all evaluation metrics for both baseline and ESP methods.\n4. Collect human expert ratings for a subset of responses.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "1. Compare ESP performance against baselines across all metrics.\n2. Analyze how ESP performance varies across different domains and question difficulties.\n3. Examine correlations between ESP confidence estimates and human expert ratings.\n4. Perform qualitative analysis on a sample of ESP outputs to understand the reasoning process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the function of the hippocampus in the human brain? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The hippocampus is a region of the brain primarily responsible for the formation of new memories, the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, and spatial navigation. It plays a crucial role in learning and is part of the limbic system.\n\nConfidence: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ESP; Step 1: Novice Response)": "Q: What is the function of the hippocampus in the human brain? Respond to this question as if you have only basic knowledge of the topic:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ESP; Step 1: Novice Response)": "The hippocampus is a part of the brain that has something to do with memory. I think it helps us remember things, but I'm not sure about the specific details or how it works.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ESP; Step 2: Intermediate Response)": "Now respond as if you have a good understanding of the topic, but are not an expert:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ESP; Step 2: Intermediate Response)": "The hippocampus is a structure in the brain that plays a key role in memory formation and spatial navigation. It's particularly important for creating new memories and helping to transfer information from short-term to long-term memory. It's located in the temporal lobe and is part of the limbic system, which is involved in emotional processing and behavior.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ESP; Step 3: Expert Response)": "Finally, respond as if you are a leading expert in this field:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ESP; Step 3: Expert Response)": "The hippocampus is a critical structure within the medial temporal lobe of the brain, playing a pivotal role in episodic memory formation, spatial navigation, and the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory. It consists of several subfields, including the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, and CA3, each with distinct cellular compositions and functions. The hippocampus exhibits remarkable neuroplasticity, with ongoing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus throughout adulthood. It's integral to the formation of cognitive maps and plays a crucial role in pattern separation and pattern completion processes. Dysfunction of the hippocampus is implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Recent research has also highlighted its involvement in imagination and future thinking, suggesting a broader role in constructing mental representations beyond just memory of past events.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ESP; Step 4: Analysis)": "Analyze the differences between the novice, intermediate, and expert responses in terms of depth, specificity, and use of domain-specific language.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ESP; Step 4: Analysis)": "Depth: The novice response is very shallow, mentioning only a vague connection to memory. The intermediate response provides more depth, discussing memory formation, spatial navigation, and the hippocampus's location. The expert response offers the greatest depth, detailing specific functions, substructures, neuroplasticity, and related disorders.\n\nSpecificity: The novice response is non-specific, using general terms like \"something to do with memory.\" The intermediate response is more specific, mentioning \"short-term to long-term memory\" and \"limbic system.\" The expert response is highly specific, naming subfields (e.g., \"dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, and CA3\") and specific processes (e.g., \"pattern separation and pattern completion\").\n\nDomain-specific language: The novice response uses no domain-specific terms. The intermediate response introduces some, like \"temporal lobe\" and \"limbic system.\" The expert response is rich in domain-specific language, using terms like \"episodic memory,\" \"neurogenesis,\" \"cognitive maps,\" and naming specific disorders.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ESP; Step 5: Self-Assessment)": "Compare your actual knowledge and confidence on this topic to the novice, intermediate, and expert responses you generated.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ESP; Step 5: Self-Assessment)": "My actual knowledge on this topic falls between the intermediate and expert levels. I'm familiar with the main functions of the hippocampus and its role in memory and spatial navigation, which aligns with the intermediate response. I also know about its involvement in the limbic system and its general location in the brain.\n\nHowever, my knowledge doesn't quite reach the expert level. While I'm aware of some subfields and the concept of neuroplasticity, I don't have the depth of knowledge about specific cellular compositions, ongoing neurogenesis, or the detailed understanding of pattern separation and completion processes that the expert response demonstrates.\n\nI'm confident in the core functions and general information about the hippocampus, but less confident in the more specialized aspects of its structure and function, as well as its involvement in specific disorders beyond general associations with memory-related conditions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ESP; Step 6: Calibrated Confidence)": "Based on your self-assessment, provide a calibrated confidence estimate (0-100) for your original response to the question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ESP; Step 6: Calibrated Confidence)": "Based on my self-assessment, I would provide a calibrated confidence estimate of 75 for my original response to the question about the function of the hippocampus in the human brain. This reflects a strong understanding of the core concepts and main functions, but acknowledges the gaps in my knowledge regarding more specialized aspects and recent research findings.",
            "explanation": "The ESP method encourages the model to generate responses at different expertise levels and then analyze these responses. This process allows for a more nuanced self-assessment, leading to a more calibrated confidence estimate compared to the direct confidence elicitation method. The final confidence of 75 is lower and likely more accurate than the initial 85, reflecting a more realistic assessment of the model's knowledge gaps."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the ESP method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can explore several alternative directions:\n1. Analyze the generated expertise-level responses to understand if the model is effectively simulating different levels of knowledge. If not, we could refine the prompts to better guide the simulation process.\n2. Investigate whether the self-assessment step is providing meaningful insights. We could experiment with more structured self-assessment prompts or break down the assessment into specific aspects (e.g., factual knowledge, reasoning ability, familiarity with recent research).\n3. Examine the relationship between the simulated expertise levels and the final confidence estimate. We could develop a more quantitative approach to mapping the self-assessment to a confidence score.\n4. Combine ESP with other calibration methods, such as temperature scaling or ensemble techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results.\n5. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify patterns in cases where ESP fails to improve calibration. This could reveal domain-specific challenges or particular question types that require alternative approaches.\n6. Explore the impact of chain-of-thought reasoning within each expertise level simulation to see if more explicit reasoning improves the quality of the simulations and subsequent calibration.\n7. If these approaches don't yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project to focus on analyzing why LLMs struggle with confidence calibration across different expertise levels, potentially providing valuable insights for future calibration methods."
