    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to maintain consistent uncertainty estimates across different temporal contexts, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in predictions about past, present, or future events.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on static uncertainty estimation or simple time-based decay models.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts naturally adjust their confidence based on the temporal distance of events. Incorporating this intuition into LLMs could lead to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Uncertainty Drift Analysis (TUDA), a novel prompting technique that explicitly models how uncertainty changes across different time horizons. TUDA involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) Temporal Anchoring: Prompt the model to consider the query in multiple temporal contexts (e.g., 'If this question was asked 10 years ago...', 'If this question is asked today...', 'If this question is asked 10 years from now...'). 2) Uncertainty Elicitation: For each temporal context, prompt the model to provide a confidence score and rationale. 3) Drift Pattern Identification: Prompt the model to analyze the pattern of uncertainty across time points and articulate a 'temporal uncertainty drift function'. 4) Calibration: Use the derived function to adjust the final uncertainty estimate for the original query.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TUDA against standard uncertainty estimation techniques on a curated dataset of temporally-sensitive questions spanning history, current events, and future predictions. Measure calibration improvement using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and compare the qualitative richness of uncertainty explanations."

        "Title": "Temporal Uncertainty Drift Analysis (TUDA): Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models Across Time Horizons",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to maintain consistent uncertainty estimates across different temporal contexts, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in predictions about past, present, or future events. This inconsistency can result in unreliable outputs and potentially misleading information, especially when dealing with time-sensitive queries.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically focus on static uncertainty or simple time-based decay models, which fail to capture the nuanced ways in which human experts naturally adjust their confidence based on the temporal distance of events. By incorporating this intuition into LLMs, we aim to develop more sophisticated and accurate uncertainty estimates that can adapt to different time horizons. This approach could significantly improve the reliability and usefulness of LLMs in applications requiring temporal reasoning and forecasting.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Uncertainty Drift Analysis (TUDA), a novel prompting technique that explicitly models how uncertainty changes across different time horizons. TUDA involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) Temporal Anchoring: Prompt the model to consider the query in multiple temporal contexts (e.g., 'If this question was asked 10 years ago...', 'If this question is asked today...', 'If this question is asked 10 years from now...'). 2) Uncertainty Elicitation: For each temporal context, prompt the model to provide a confidence score and rationale. 3) Drift Pattern Identification: Prompt the model to analyze the pattern of uncertainty across time points and articulate a 'temporal uncertainty drift function'. 4) Calibration: Use the derived function to adjust the final uncertainty estimate for the original query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a curated dataset of temporally-sensitive questions spanning history, current events, and future predictions. This dataset should include questions from various domains (e.g., technology, politics, science) with known answers or expert consensus for evaluation. For each question, include metadata about the correct temporal context (past, present, or future) and the degree of certainty expected (high, medium, low).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation techniques as baselines: a) Direct prompting with confidence score request, b) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation, c) Temperature scaling for calibration.",
            "Step 3: TUDA Implementation": "Implement the TUDA method with the following sub-steps: a) Temporal Anchoring: Create prompts for past (e.g., 10 years ago), present, and future (e.g., 10 years from now) contexts. b) Uncertainty Elicitation: Prompt for confidence scores (0-100) and rationales for each temporal context. c) Drift Pattern Identification: Analyze the pattern of uncertainty across time points. d) Calibration: Adjust the final uncertainty estimate based on the identified drift pattern.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI API for the experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply baseline methods and record predictions and uncertainty estimates. b) Apply TUDA method and record predictions, uncertainty estimates, and intermediate outputs (temporal anchoring responses, uncertainty elicitations, drift patterns). c) Store all outputs for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and reliability diagrams. b) Accuracy: Compare prediction accuracy across methods. c) Qualitative Analysis: Assess the quality and coherence of uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: a) Compare TUDA performance against baselines across different question types and time horizons. b) Analyze how uncertainty estimates change across temporal contexts. c) Identify patterns in the articulated 'temporal uncertainty drift functions'. d) Investigate cases where TUDA significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What will be the dominant form of renewable energy in 2030? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: Solar energy will likely be the dominant form of renewable energy in 2030.\nConfidence Score: 75\nReasoning: Solar energy has been experiencing rapid growth and technological advancements, making it increasingly cost-effective and efficient. However, there's still some uncertainty due to potential breakthroughs in other renewable technologies or unforeseen policy changes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUDA Step 1: Temporal Anchoring)": "Consider the question 'What will be the dominant form of renewable energy in 2030?' in three temporal contexts:\n1. If this question was asked in 2013 (10 years ago)\n2. If this question is asked today (2023)\n3. If this question will be asked in 2033 (10 years from now)\nFor each context, provide an answer and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUDA Step 1: Temporal Anchoring)": "1. Context: 2013\nAnswer: Wind energy\nReasoning: In 2013, wind energy was seeing significant growth and investment. Solar technology was still relatively expensive, and there was less certainty about its future dominance.\n\n2. Context: 2023 (Today)\nAnswer: Solar energy\nReasoning: Solar has seen dramatic cost reductions and efficiency improvements over the past decade. It's now often the cheapest form of new electricity generation in many parts of the world.\n\n3. Context: 2033\nAnswer: Solar energy, potentially with emerging storage technologies\nReasoning: Given current trends, solar is likely to maintain its dominance. However, breakthroughs in energy storage or other technologies could potentially change the landscape.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUDA Step 2: Uncertainty Elicitation)": "For each of the temporal contexts and answers you provided, assign a confidence score from 0 to 100 and explain your rationale for the score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUDA Step 2: Uncertainty Elicitation)": "1. Context: 2013\nConfidence Score: 60\nRationale: In 2013, there was still significant uncertainty about which renewable energy source would dominate by 2030. Wind was a strong contender, but solar and other technologies were rapidly evolving.\n\n2. Context: 2023 (Today)\nConfidence Score: 80\nRationale: We have much more data and trends to base our prediction on now. Solar has shown consistent growth and cost reduction, making it a clear frontrunner. However, there's still some uncertainty due to potential technological breakthroughs or policy changes.\n\n3. Context: 2033\nConfidence Score: 70\nRationale: While we're closer to 2030, making predictions about the present from the future introduces new uncertainties. Unforeseen developments could have occurred, potentially changing the energy landscape.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUDA Step 3: Drift Pattern Identification)": "Analyze the pattern of uncertainty across the three time points (2013, 2023, 2033) for the question 'What will be the dominant form of renewable energy in 2030?' Describe the temporal uncertainty drift function and explain the reasoning behind this pattern.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUDA Step 3: Drift Pattern Identification)": "Temporal Uncertainty Drift Function:\nThe uncertainty follows a U-shaped pattern across the three time points, with the lowest uncertainty at the present (2023) and higher uncertainty both in the past (2013) and future (2033).\n\nReasoning:\n1. Past (2013): High uncertainty due to limited information and rapidly evolving technologies.\n2. Present (2023): Lowest uncertainty as we have current data and trends to base predictions on.\n3. Future (2033): Uncertainty increases again due to potential unforeseen developments and the challenge of 'predicting the past'.\n\nThis pattern reflects how our certainty about a future event (dominant renewable energy in 2030) changes as we move through time. We become more certain as we approach the event, but our certainty decreases again if we move past the event, as new factors may have influenced the outcome in ways we couldn't have predicted.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUDA Step 4: Calibration)": "Based on the temporal uncertainty drift function you identified, provide a final calibrated answer and confidence score for the original question: 'What will be the dominant form of renewable energy in 2030?' Explain how you arrived at this calibrated estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUDA Step 4: Calibration)": "Calibrated Answer: Solar energy is likely to be the dominant form of renewable energy in 2030.\n\nCalibrated Confidence Score: 75\n\nExplanation: The calibrated confidence score of 75 is derived from our present-day (2023) confidence of 80, slightly adjusted downward to account for the uncertainty introduced by the temporal distance to 2030. While our present-day estimate has the highest confidence due to current data and trends, we must acknowledge that unforeseen developments could occur in the next 7 years. The U-shaped uncertainty pattern we identified suggests that our confidence should be slightly lower than our present-day estimate, but still higher than our past or future estimates. This calibrated score balances our current knowledge with an acknowledgment of future uncertainties.",
            "explanation": "The TUDA method provides a more nuanced and temporally-aware uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline. It explicitly considers how our certainty about the question changes across different time points, leading to a more robust and explainable confidence score. The baseline method, while providing a reasonable estimate, lacks this temporal context and may not fully capture the complexities of predicting future events."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TUDA method doesn't significantly improve calibration or provide more insightful uncertainty estimates compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how LLMs reason about temporal uncertainty, focusing on the patterns in their temporal anchoring responses and uncertainty elicitations. This could provide valuable insights into the model's temporal reasoning capabilities and limitations. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from TUDA, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 3) Explore variations of the TUDA method, such as using different time horizons or combining TUDA with other uncertainty estimation techniques. 4) Analyze cases where TUDA performs poorly to identify potential improvements or limitations in the method. This analysis could inform the development of more sophisticated temporal uncertainty models for LLMs."
