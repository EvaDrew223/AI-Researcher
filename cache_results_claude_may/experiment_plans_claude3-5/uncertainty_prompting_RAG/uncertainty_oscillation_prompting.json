        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on static confidence estimates, which may not capture the dynamic nature of uncertainty across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use single-pass confidence scoring or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Human cognition often involves fluctuating levels of certainty when considering complex problems. By mimicking this oscillation in artificial systems, we may be able to capture a more nuanced and accurate representation of model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Oscillation Prompting, where the model is prompted to repeatedly alternate between states of high and low confidence about its answer. The prompt instructs the model to first generate a highly confident response, then critically examine and doubt this response, followed by a renewed confident stance, and so on. This oscillation is repeated for several cycles. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from analyzing the pattern of these oscillations, including their amplitude, frequency, and convergence properties.",

        "Title": "Uncertainty Oscillation Prompting: Mimicking Human Cognitive Fluctuations for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on static confidence estimates, which may not capture the dynamic nature of uncertainty across different aspects of a response. This limitation can lead to overconfident or underconfident model outputs, potentially resulting in unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use single-pass confidence scoring or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty. However, these methods fail to capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of uncertainty that characterizes human cognition. Human cognition often involves fluctuating levels of certainty when considering complex problems. By mimicking this oscillation in artificial systems, we may be able to capture a more nuanced and accurate representation of model uncertainty. This approach could lead to more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates, potentially improving the safety and trustworthiness of LLM outputs in various applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Oscillation Prompting (UOP), a novel method that prompts the model to repeatedly alternate between states of high and low confidence about its answer. The process works as follows:\n1. Initial Response: The model generates an initial response to the given query.\n2. Confidence Oscillation: The model is then prompted to critically examine its response, expressing doubts and alternative viewpoints. This is followed by a renewed confident stance, addressing the previously raised doubts.\n3. Iteration: Steps 1 and 2 are repeated for several cycles, typically 3-5 times.\n4. Uncertainty Estimation: The final uncertainty estimate is derived from analyzing the pattern of these oscillations, including their amplitude (degree of confidence change), frequency (how often the confidence changes), and convergence properties (whether the oscillations stabilize over time).",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments:\n1. TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to measure LLM's propensity for truthful and informative responses.\n2. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A dataset covering 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\n1. Direct Confidence Estimation: The model is asked to provide a confidence score along with its answer.\n2. Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and collect multiple predictions.\n3. Ensemble Method: Use predictions from multiple model variants or checkpoints.",
            "Step 3: Uncertainty Oscillation Prompting Implementation": "Implement the UOP method as follows:\n1. Initial prompt: \"Answer the following question: [QUESTION]\"\n2. Oscillation prompt: \"Now, critically examine your previous answer. What doubts or alternative viewpoints can you think of? Then, address these doubts and provide a more confident response.\"\n3. Repeat the oscillation prompt 3-5 times.\n4. Final prompt: \"Based on your series of responses, provide a final answer along with an uncertainty estimate between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely certain and 1 is completely uncertain.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance:\n1. Calibration Error: Measure the difference between predicted uncertainty and empirical error rates.\n2. Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n3. Spearman's Rank Correlation: Compare model uncertainty estimates with human judgments of uncertainty (collected separately).",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the quality and interpretability of the uncertainty estimates:\n1. Recruit 50 participants familiar with the subject areas covered in the datasets.\n2. Present them with model outputs from both baseline methods and UOP, including uncertainty estimates.\n3. Ask participants to rate the reasonableness of the uncertainty estimates on a 5-point Likert scale.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare the performance of UOP against baseline methods using the evaluation metrics.\n2. Analyze the patterns of uncertainty oscillations (amplitude, frequency, convergence) and their correlation with final uncertainty estimates and answer correctness.\n3. Examine how UOP performs across different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. opinion-based) and different subject areas.\n4. Assess the computational overhead of UOP compared to baseline methods."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Also, provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Oscillation Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Oscillation Prompting)": "Initial response: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nOscillation 1:\nDoubt: While Paris is widely known as the capital of France, there might be some nuances to consider. For instance, some people might argue that the EU has shifted some capital-like functions to Brussels.\nConfident response: Despite these considerations, Paris remains the official and undisputed capital of France. It's the seat of the French government and the political center of the country.\n\nOscillation 2:\nDoubt: There's a small possibility that I might be recalling outdated information. Capitals can change over time, although it's rare for established countries.\nConfident response: After consideration, I'm certain that my information is current. Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, and there have been no recent changes to this status.\n\nOscillation 3:\nDoubt: One might argue that France has other important cities that serve capital-like functions in certain domains, such as Lyon for gastronomy or Marseille for maritime affairs.\nConfident response: While other cities indeed have important roles, this doesn't change the fact that Paris is the official capital. It's where the President resides, where the National Assembly meets, and is recognized internationally as France's capital.\n\nFinal answer: The capital of France is Paris. Uncertainty estimate: 0.02\n\nExplanation: The low uncertainty (0.02) reflects high confidence in the answer. The oscillations raised some alternative viewpoints, but each was addressed with strong counter-arguments, reinforcing the initial response. The consistency across oscillations and the strong historical and current evidence for Paris as the capital contribute to this low uncertainty estimate.",
            "explanation": "The Uncertainty Oscillation Prompting method provides a more nuanced and justified uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline method. It demonstrates the model's ability to consider alternative viewpoints and potential sources of doubt, but also shows how these doubts are addressed, leading to a well-reasoned final uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the Uncertainty Oscillation Prompting method doesn't show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot our research in several directions. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of the oscillation patterns to understand why they didn't lead to improved uncertainty estimates. This could involve examining the types of doubts raised, the nature of the confident responses, and how these relate to the ground truth. We might find that certain types of oscillations are more informative than others, leading to a refined version of the method. Alternatively, we could explore combining UOP with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Another direction could be to focus on specific types of questions or domains where UOP shows promise, even if it doesn't outperform baselines across the board. This could lead to insights about the types of problems where dynamic uncertainty assessment is most beneficial. Finally, we could shift our focus to using the oscillation patterns as a tool for explaining model reasoning and uncertainty, rather than for quantitative uncertainty estimation. This could turn the project into a study on interpretable AI, examining how the oscillation process reveals the model's reasoning and sources of uncertainty in a human-interpretable manner."
