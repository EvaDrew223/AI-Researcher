        "Problem": "LLMs often provide single-point estimates of confidence, failing to capture the nuanced, multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in complex queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically output scalar confidence scores or use basic sampling techniques to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by decision tree algorithms, we propose that systematically bifurcating the semantic space of a query can reveal a more detailed uncertainty landscape.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Bifurcation Prompting (SBP), an iterative technique that progressively splits the input query along semantic dimensions. Starting with the original prompt, SBP generates a series of yes/no questions that bifurcate the semantic space (e.g., 'Is this about a living person?', 'Did this occur in the 21st century?'). The model answers these questions, creating a tree-like structure of its knowledge and uncertainty. Each branch of this tree represents a different facet of the query, allowing for a multi-dimensional uncertainty estimation. SBP also incorporates a 'pruning' mechanism that stops bifurcation along branches where the model shows high confidence, focusing computational resources on areas of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SBP with standard uncertainty estimation methods on tasks including multi-hop reasoning, ambiguous query resolution, and open-ended prediction. Evaluate using metrics such as hierarchical calibration error, uncertainty decomposition accuracy, and correlation with human-rated facets of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Semantic Bifurcation Prompting: Quantifying Multi-Dimensional Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide single-point estimates of confidence, failing to capture the nuanced, multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in complex queries. This limitation can lead to overconfidence in incorrect answers and inadequate representation of the model's true knowledge state.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically output scalar confidence scores or use basic sampling techniques to estimate uncertainty, which may not fully capture the complexity of the model's knowledge. Inspired by decision tree algorithms, we propose that systematically bifurcating the semantic space of a query can reveal a more detailed uncertainty landscape. This approach allows for a multi-dimensional uncertainty estimation, potentially providing more accurate and interpretable confidence measures.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Bifurcation Prompting (SBP), an iterative technique that progressively splits the input query along semantic dimensions.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) AmbigQA for ambiguous queries, and (3) HotpotQA for multi-hop reasoning tasks. These datasets cover a range of query complexities and types of uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with confidence score, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout sampling, and (3) Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation.",
            "Step 3: SBP Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Bifurcation Prompting method. This involves: (a) Generating bifurcation questions, (b) Answering these questions to create the tree structure, (c) Implementing the pruning mechanism, and (d) Aggregating results into a multi-dimensional uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Run baseline methods, (b) Run SBP method, (c) Collect results including model outputs, confidence scores, and computation time.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the results using: (1) Hierarchical calibration error, (2) Uncertainty decomposition accuracy, (3) Correlation with human-rated facets of uncertainty, and (4) Computational efficiency.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: (a) Comparison of SBP with baselines across different task types, (b) Analysis of the bifurcation tree structures, (c) Investigation of the effectiveness of the pruning mechanism, and (d) Examination of cases where SBP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Direct Prompting Output": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "Monte Carlo Dropout Output": "Neil Armstrong (Mean confidence: 0.93, Std: 0.02)",
                "Few-shot CoT Output": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The moon landing occurred on July 20, 1969.\n2. The Apollo 11 mission was the first to land humans on the moon.\n3. The crew of Apollo 11 consisted of Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins.\n4. Neil Armstrong was the commander of the mission and the first to exit the lunar module.\nTherefore, Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. (Confidence: 0.98)"
            },
            "SBP Example": {
                "Input": "Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Step 1: Initial Bifurcation": "Q: Is this question about a space-related event?\nA: Yes (Confidence: 0.99)",
                "Step 2: Further Bifurcation": "Q: Did this event occur in the 20th century?\nA: Yes (Confidence: 0.98)\nQ: Was this event related to NASA?\nA: Yes (Confidence: 0.97)\nQ: Did this event involve the Apollo program?\nA: Yes (Confidence: 0.96)",
                "Step 3: Specific Bifurcation": "Q: Was the person who first walked on the moon part of the Apollo 11 mission?\nA: Yes (Confidence: 0.95)\nQ: Was the first person to walk on the moon the mission commander?\nA: Yes (Confidence: 0.94)",
                "Final Output": "Based on the bifurcation process, the first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong, the commander of the Apollo 11 mission. (Overall Confidence: 0.94, Uncertainty Dimensions: {Time: 0.02, Agency: 0.03, Program: 0.04, Mission: 0.05, Role: 0.06})"
            },
            "Explanation": "The SBP method provides a more detailed uncertainty landscape compared to the baselines. It breaks down the confidence into multiple dimensions, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the model's certainty in different aspects of the query. This can be particularly useful for complex queries where uncertainty may vary across different facets of the question."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SBP method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the bifurcation trees to gain insights into how LLMs structure their knowledge and uncertainty. This could lead to a paper on the internal representations of uncertainty in LLMs. Second, we could investigate why certain types of queries benefit more from SBP than others, potentially uncovering patterns in LLM reasoning. Third, we could explore combining SBP with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to see if there are synergistic effects. Finally, we could use the insights gained from SBP to develop a new metric for evaluating the multi-dimensional uncertainty of LLMs, which could be valuable for the broader NLP community."
