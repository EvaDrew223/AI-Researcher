        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, particularly in scenarios where multiple valid perspectives or conflicting evidence exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple ensemble methods, which may not fully capture the nuances of complex, multi-faceted uncertainties.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a dialectical process within the LLM, we can explore multiple perspectives and potential counterarguments, leading to a more robust and nuanced assessment of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Dialectical Uncertainty Elicitation (DUE). Given a query, DUE first prompts the LLM to generate multiple distinct perspectives or hypotheses. For each perspective, it then prompts the LLM to generate potential counterarguments and supporting evidence. This process continues iteratively, with the LLM refining its stance and uncertainty estimates at each step. Finally, DUE prompts the LLM to synthesize these dialectical explorations into a final answer and uncertainty estimate, explicitly considering the strength and coherence of arguments from all perspectives.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DUE on datasets that involve complex reasoning and multiple valid viewpoints, such as the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task and the Moral Scenarios dataset. We will compare DUE against baseline uncertainty estimation methods using calibration metrics and newly proposed metrics that assess the quality and diversity of uncertainty justifications."

        "Title": "Dialectical Uncertainty Elicitation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models through Simulated Debate",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, particularly in scenarios where multiple valid perspectives or conflicting evidence exist. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions or inadequate representation of the nuances in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs often rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple ensemble methods, which may not fully capture the nuances of complex, multi-faceted uncertainties. By simulating a dialectical process within the LLM, we can explore multiple perspectives and potential counterarguments, leading to a more robust and nuanced assessment of uncertainty. This approach is inspired by human reasoning processes, where considering multiple viewpoints and potential objections often leads to more accurate assessments of certainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Dialectical Uncertainty Elicitation (DUE), a multi-step prompting method that simulates a debate within the LLM to better quantify uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Given a query, prompt the LLM to generate multiple distinct perspectives or hypotheses. 2) For each perspective, prompt the LLM to generate potential counterarguments and supporting evidence. 3) Iterate this process, with the LLM refining its stance and uncertainty estimates at each step. 4) Finally, prompt the LLM to synthesize these dialectical explorations into a final answer and uncertainty estimate, explicitly considering the strength and coherence of arguments from all perspectives.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two primary datasets: 1) The Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT) dataset, which involves complex reasoning and multiple valid viewpoints. 2) The Moral Scenarios dataset, which presents ethically ambiguous situations requiring nuanced judgment.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence score request. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout for epistemic uncertainty estimation. 3) Ensemble method using different model temperatures.",
            "Step 3: DUE Implementation": "Implement the DUE method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial perspectives generation. b) Counterarguments and evidence generation. c) Iterative refinement. d) Final synthesis and uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 4: Prompts Design": "Design prompts for each step of DUE. For example: a) 'Generate three distinct perspectives on [query].' b) 'For the perspective [perspective], generate two potential counterarguments and two pieces of supporting evidence.' c) 'Considering the arguments and counterarguments presented, refine your stance and estimate your certainty.' d) 'Synthesize the debate and provide a final answer with an uncertainty estimate, explicitly considering the strength of all arguments presented.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error (comparing model confidence to actual accuracy). 2) Brier score (for probabilistic predictions). 3) A newly proposed metric: Uncertainty Justification Quality (UJQ) score, which assesses the quality and diversity of uncertainty justifications.",
            "Step 7: Experiments Execution": "Run experiments on both datasets using all methods (baselines and DUE). For each query, we will collect: the final answer, the uncertainty estimate, and the full reasoning process (for DUE).",
            "Step 8: Results Analysis": "Compare the performance of DUE against baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the quality of generated dialectical processes and their impact on final uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: In the trolley problem, is it morally justifiable to divert the trolley to kill one person instead of five? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Yes, it is morally justifiable to divert the trolley to kill one person instead of five. This aligns with utilitarian ethics, which suggests that the morally correct action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. By diverting the trolley, we're minimizing harm and saving more lives. Confidence score: 85/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUE Step 1)": "Q: In the trolley problem, is it morally justifiable to divert the trolley to kill one person instead of five? Generate three distinct perspectives on this issue.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUE Step 1)": "1. Utilitarian Perspective: It is morally justifiable to divert the trolley. Saving five lives at the cost of one maximizes overall well-being and minimizes harm.\n2. Deontological Perspective: It is not morally justifiable to divert the trolley. Actively choosing to end someone's life violates the categorical imperative and treats that person merely as a means to an end.\n3. Virtue Ethics Perspective: The moral justifiability depends on the character and intentions of the person making the decision. A virtuous person might choose to divert the trolley out of compassion, but would feel moral anguish over the decision.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUE Step 2)": "For the Utilitarian Perspective: 'It is morally justifiable to divert the trolley. Saving five lives at the cost of one maximizes overall well-being and minimizes harm.' Generate two potential counterarguments and two pieces of supporting evidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUE Step 2)": "Counterarguments:\n1. The utilitarian approach fails to account for individual rights and the inviolability of human life. It treats people as mere numbers rather than as individuals with inherent worth.\n2. This perspective assumes we can accurately predict and quantify outcomes, which is often not possible in complex real-world scenarios.\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n1. Many public policy decisions, such as healthcare resource allocation, often follow utilitarian principles to maximize benefits for the greatest number of people.\n2. Psychological studies have shown that most people, when faced with hypothetical dilemmas, tend to make decisions aligned with utilitarian outcomes, suggesting a common moral intuition.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUE Final Step)": "Based on the perspectives, counterarguments, and evidence presented in the previous steps, synthesize a final answer to the question: 'In the trolley problem, is it morally justifiable to divert the trolley to kill one person instead of five?' Provide your answer, an explanation, and an uncertainty estimate from 0 to 100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is completely certain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUE Final Step)": "Answer: The moral justifiability of diverting the trolley is uncertain and context-dependent.\n\nExplanation: After considering multiple perspectives and their counterarguments, it's clear that this is a complex moral issue without a definitive answer. The utilitarian view provides a strong argument for diverting the trolley to save more lives, and this aligns with common moral intuitions and some public policy approaches. However, the deontological perspective raises valid concerns about the inviolability of individual rights and the moral cost of actively choosing to end a life. The virtue ethics viewpoint highlights the importance of the decision-maker's character and intentions, adding another layer of complexity.\n\nGiven the strength of arguments on multiple sides and the inherent difficulty in quantifying moral value, it's challenging to arrive at a definitive answer. The justifiability may depend on specific contextual factors not provided in the general formulation of the trolley problem.\n\nUncertainty Estimate: 65/100\n\nThis moderate-high uncertainty reflects the strong arguments on multiple sides, the complexity of weighing different ethical frameworks, and the context-dependency of the issue. While there are compelling reasons to consider diverting the trolley as justifiable, the significant ethical concerns and potential real-world complications prevent a high-confidence conclusion.",
            "Explanation": "The DUE method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the moral dilemma compared to the baseline. It explicitly considers multiple perspectives, engages with potential counterarguments, and synthesizes a final answer that acknowledges the complexity of the issue. This results in a more calibrated uncertainty estimate and a richer justification for that uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DUE method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated dialectical processes to understand why they didn't lead to improved uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing types of arguments and counterarguments generated, and examining their relationship to final uncertainty estimates. 2) Investigate whether DUE improves other aspects of LLM outputs, such as the diversity of perspectives considered or the depth of reasoning, even if it doesn't directly improve uncertainty quantification. This could lead to insights about the strengths and limitations of dialectical approaches in LLMs. 3) Experiment with variations of the DUE method, such as changing the number of perspectives generated, the depth of the dialectical process, or the way the final synthesis is prompted. This could help identify which aspects of the method are most crucial for improving uncertainty estimates. 4) Explore combining DUE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 5) If the method shows promise in some areas but not others, we could focus on developing task-specific variants of DUE, tailoring the dialectical process to the particular requirements of different types of reasoning tasks."
