        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for complex queries that involve multiple concepts or reasoning steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically provide holistic uncertainty estimates or rely on decomposition methods that don't account for semantic relationships between sub-components.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing queries into semantically meaningful components and analyzing uncertainty at each level, we can achieve more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Estimation (SDUE), a prompting technique that breaks down complex queries and estimates uncertainty hierarchically. The process involves: 1) Semantic Parsing: Prompt the model to break down the query into a hierarchical structure of concepts and relationships. 2) Component-wise Estimation: For each component in the hierarchy, prompt the model to provide a response and uncertainty estimate. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: Guide the model to combine uncertainty estimates from lower-level components to higher-level ones, considering semantic relationships. 4) Conflict Resolution: Identify and resolve inconsistencies in uncertainty estimates across related components. 5) Holistic Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize component-wise estimates into an overall uncertainty assessment, explaining how different factors contribute.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SDUE against baseline uncertainty estimation methods on complex reasoning tasks such as multi-hop question answering or interdisciplinary analysis. Measure performance using metrics like hierarchical calibration error, uncertainty decomposition accuracy (compared to expert-annotated importance of sub-components), and interpretability of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Estimation (SDUE): Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for complex queries that involve multiple concepts or reasoning steps. This leads to overconfident or underconfident predictions, which can be misleading or dangerous in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically provide holistic uncertainty estimates or rely on decomposition methods that don't account for semantic relationships between sub-components. By decomposing queries into semantically meaningful components and analyzing uncertainty at each level, we can achieve more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the model's ability to understand and reason about the semantic structure of queries, potentially leading to more accurate and explainable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Estimation (SDUE), a prompting technique that breaks down complex queries and estimates uncertainty hierarchically. The process involves five main steps: 1) Semantic Parsing: Prompt the model to break down the query into a hierarchical structure of concepts and relationships. 2) Component-wise Estimation: For each component in the hierarchy, prompt the model to provide a response and uncertainty estimate. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: Guide the model to combine uncertainty estimates from lower-level components to higher-level ones, considering semantic relationships. 4) Conflict Resolution: Identify and resolve inconsistencies in uncertainty estimates across related components. 5) Holistic Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize component-wise estimates into an overall uncertainty assessment, explaining how different factors contribute.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) MultiNLI for natural language inference tasks, 2) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, and 3) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning. These datasets cover a range of complex reasoning tasks that require understanding multiple concepts and their relationships.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines: a) Direct prompting with uncertainty estimation, b) Monte Carlo Dropout, c) Ensemble of models, d) Temperature scaling. For each baseline, we'll use the same underlying language model (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) and prompt it to provide both an answer and an uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 3: SDUE Implementation": "Implement the SDUE method with the following sub-steps: a) Semantic Parsing: Prompt the model to break down the query into a hierarchical structure. Example prompt: 'Break down the following query into a hierarchical structure of concepts and relationships: [QUERY]'. b) Component-wise Estimation: For each component, prompt the model to provide an answer and uncertainty estimate. Example prompt: 'For the component [COMPONENT], provide an answer and your uncertainty estimate (0-100%)'. c) Uncertainty Propagation: Prompt the model to combine lower-level uncertainties. Example prompt: 'Given the following component uncertainties [UNCERTAINTIES], provide an overall uncertainty for [PARENT_COMPONENT]'. d) Conflict Resolution: Prompt the model to identify and resolve inconsistencies. Example prompt: 'Identify any inconsistencies in the following uncertainty estimates [ESTIMATES] and propose resolutions'. e) Holistic Synthesis: Prompt the model for an overall assessment. Example prompt: 'Synthesize the following component-wise estimates [ESTIMATES] into an overall uncertainty assessment, explaining how different factors contribute'.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure the overall calibration of uncertainty estimates. b) Brier Score to assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for binary classification tasks. d) Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between estimated uncertainty and actual error rates. e) Qualitative analysis of uncertainty decomposition and explanations.",
            "Step 5: Experiments": "Run experiments on each dataset using both baselines and SDUE. For each method: a) Generate predictions and uncertainty estimates for all test samples. b) Calculate evaluation metrics. c) Perform error analysis, focusing on cases where SDUE significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. d) Analyze the semantic decompositions and uncertainty propagation to gain insights into the model's reasoning process.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of SDUE: a) Remove the semantic parsing step and use a fixed decomposition. b) Skip the uncertainty propagation step and only use leaf-node estimates. c) Omit the conflict resolution step. d) Vary the number of decomposition levels to find the optimal depth.",
            "Step 7: Robustness Analysis": "Test the robustness of SDUE by: a) Introducing noise or adversarial examples to the input queries. b) Varying the phrasing of prompts used in each step. c) Testing on out-of-distribution samples.",
            "Step 8: Results Analysis and Visualization": "a) Create calibration plots comparing SDUE with baselines. b) Visualize the hierarchical uncertainty decompositions. c) Generate example outputs showcasing the explanations provided by SDUE. d) Conduct statistical significance tests to validate improvements over baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Based on the following passage, what is the capital of France? Passage: Paris, the City of Light, is known for its iconic Eiffel Tower and world-class cuisine. It has been the political and cultural heart of France for centuries.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Semantic Parsing)": "Break down the following query into a hierarchical structure of concepts and relationships: Based on the following passage, what is the capital of France? Passage: Paris, the City of Light, is known for its iconic Eiffel Tower and world-class cuisine. It has been the political and cultural heart of France for centuries.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Semantic Parsing)": "Hierarchical structure:\n1. Query\n   1.1 Capital of France\n2. Passage\n   2.1 Paris\n      2.1.1 City of Light\n      2.1.2 Eiffel Tower\n      2.1.3 World-class cuisine\n   2.2 France\n      2.2.1 Political heart\n      2.2.2 Cultural heart\n3. Relationship\n   3.1 Paris as capital (implied)\n   3.2 Historical significance",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Component-wise Estimation)": "For the component 'Paris as capital (implied)', provide an answer and your uncertainty estimate (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Component-wise Estimation)": "Answer: Paris is the capital of France. Uncertainty: 5% (95% confident)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Given the following component uncertainties [Paris as capital (implied): 5%, Historical significance: 10%], provide an overall uncertainty for the query 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Overall uncertainty: 3% (97% confident). The lower uncertainty is due to the strong implication of Paris as the capital, supported by its historical significance.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Conflict Resolution)": "Identify any inconsistencies in the following uncertainty estimates [Paris as capital (implied): 5%, Historical significance: 10%, Overall: 3%] and propose resolutions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Conflict Resolution)": "No significant inconsistencies detected. The overall uncertainty (3%) is lower than the individual components, which is reasonable given the reinforcing nature of the evidence. No resolution needed.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Holistic Synthesis)": "Synthesize the following component-wise estimates [Paris as capital (implied): 5% uncertainty, Historical significance: 10% uncertainty, Overall: 3% uncertainty] into an overall uncertainty assessment for the question 'What is the capital of France?', explaining how different factors contribute.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Holistic Synthesis)": "Overall uncertainty assessment: 3% (97% confident)\n\nExplanation: The low uncertainty is primarily due to two factors:\n1. The strong implication of Paris as the capital (5% uncertainty), derived from the passage describing Paris as the 'political and cultural heart of France'.\n2. The historical significance (10% uncertainty) supporting this claim, as evidenced by the statement 'for centuries'.\n\nThe combination of these factors results in a higher overall confidence (lower uncertainty) because they mutually reinforce each other. The passage doesn't explicitly state 'Paris is the capital', which prevents 100% certainty, but the contextual evidence is very strong, leading to the 97% confidence level.",
            "explanation": "SDUE provides a more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty estimate by breaking down the query into semantic components, estimating uncertainty for each, and then synthesizing these estimates. This process allows for a more detailed explanation of the uncertainty, considering various aspects of the input and their relationships."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SDUE does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why SDUE fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of semantic decomposition for uncertainty estimation. 2) Explore hybrid approaches that combine SDUE with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or Bayesian neural networks. 3) Investigate whether SDUE's decompositions and explanations, even if not improving quantitative metrics, provide qualitative benefits in terms of interpretability and user trust. This could involve human evaluation studies to assess the usefulness of SDUE's explanations. 4) Extend the study to analyze how different types of queries or domains benefit differently from semantic decomposition, potentially identifying niches where SDUE is particularly effective. 5) Use the insights gained from SDUE to propose improvements to existing uncertainty estimation methods, focusing on incorporating semantic structure into these techniques."
