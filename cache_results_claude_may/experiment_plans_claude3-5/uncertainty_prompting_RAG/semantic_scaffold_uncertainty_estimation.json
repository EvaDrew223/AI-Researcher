        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, particularly for complex or multi-faceted queries where uncertainty may vary across different aspects of the response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically produce global uncertainty estimates or rely on decomposition methods that may not capture the semantic structure of the problem domain.",
        "Motivation": "Many knowledge domains have inherent semantic structures or hierarchies. Leveraging these structures could enable more fine-grained and semantically meaningful uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Scaffold Uncertainty Estimation, which uses domain-specific semantic structures to guide uncertainty quantification: 1) For a given domain, define a semantic scaffold - a hierarchical structure representing key concepts and their relationships. 2) Given a query, prompt the LLM to map relevant parts of its response onto this scaffold. 3) For each node in the scaffold, elicit a confidence estimate and brief justification. 4) Propagate uncertainty estimates up the scaffold, synthesizing higher-level uncertainties from lower-level components. 5) Generate a final response that incorporates this structured uncertainty information. This method provides a semantically meaningful decomposition of uncertainty that aligns with domain-specific knowledge structures.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate this method in domains with well-defined semantic structures, such as medical diagnosis or legal reasoning. Comparison will be made against flat confidence estimation and other decomposition methods. Metrics will include calibration at various levels of the semantic scaffold, as well as expert evaluation of the semantic meaningfulness of the uncertainty decomposition."

        "Title": "Semantic Scaffold Uncertainty Estimation: Leveraging Domain-Specific Structures for Calibrated Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, particularly for complex or multi-faceted queries where uncertainty may vary across different aspects of the response. This issue is especially pronounced in domains with inherent semantic structures or hierarchies, where global uncertainty estimates fail to capture the nuanced confidence levels across different components of the answer.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically produce global uncertainty estimates or rely on decomposition methods that may not capture the semantic structure of the problem domain. However, many knowledge domains have inherent semantic structures or hierarchies. Leveraging these structures could enable more fine-grained and semantically meaningful uncertainty quantification. By aligning uncertainty estimates with domain-specific knowledge structures, we can provide more interpretable and actionable confidence measures, potentially improving decision-making in critical applications such as medical diagnosis or legal reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Scaffold Uncertainty Estimation (SSUE), which uses domain-specific semantic structures to guide uncertainty quantification:\n1. Define a semantic scaffold: For a given domain, create a hierarchical structure representing key concepts and their relationships.\n2. Map response to scaffold: Given a query, prompt the LLM to map relevant parts of its response onto this scaffold.\n3. Elicit node-level confidence: For each node in the scaffold, prompt the LLM to provide a confidence estimate and brief justification.\n4. Propagate uncertainty: Synthesize higher-level uncertainties from lower-level components by propagating estimates up the scaffold.\n5. Generate final response: Produce a final answer that incorporates this structured uncertainty information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Prepare Semantic Scaffolds": "Create semantic scaffolds for two domains: medical diagnosis and legal reasoning. For medical diagnosis, use a hierarchical structure based on body systems, symptoms, and potential diagnoses. For legal reasoning, use a structure based on legal principles, case facts, and potential rulings.",
            "Step 2: Prepare Datasets": "Curate datasets for each domain. For medical diagnosis, use a subset of the MedQA dataset. For legal reasoning, use a subset of the LexGLUE dataset. Ensure that each question in the datasets can be mapped to the prepared semantic scaffolds.",
            "Step 3: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with a global confidence score, (2) Decomposition-based confidence estimation using a flat list of sub-questions.",
            "Step 4: Implement SSUE": "Develop prompts for each step of the SSUE method:\n- Scaffold mapping prompt: 'Given the following query and semantic scaffold, map the relevant parts of your response to the appropriate nodes in the scaffold.'\n- Node-level confidence prompt: 'For each node in the scaffold, provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification.'\n- Uncertainty propagation prompt: 'Based on the lower-level confidence scores, synthesize higher-level confidence scores for each parent node.'\n- Final response generation prompt: 'Generate a final response that incorporates the structured uncertainty information from the scaffold.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess performance across different model sizes.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics:\n1. Calibration error: Compare predicted confidence with actual accuracy.\n2. Semantic coherence: Have domain experts rate the coherence of the uncertainty structure.\n3. Decision quality: Assess how well the structured uncertainty helps in making decisions (e.g., treatment choices or legal judgments).\n4. Compare SSUE against baselines on these metrics.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components:\n1. Vary the granularity of the semantic scaffold.\n2. Test different uncertainty propagation methods.\n3. Compare performance with and without justifications for node-level confidences.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the results to understand:\n1. How does SSUE perform across different levels of the semantic scaffold?\n2. Are there patterns in where the model is most/least confident?\n3. How does the structured uncertainty correlate with actual errors made by the model?"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Patient presents with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide your confidence level.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The most likely diagnosis is pneumonia. Confidence level: 80%",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Decomposition-based)": "Patient presents with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. What is the most likely diagnosis? Break down your reasoning into steps and provide confidence for each step.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Decomposition-based)": "1. Assess symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath (Confidence: 95%)\n2. Consider common respiratory infections: pneumonia, bronchitis, COVID-19 (Confidence: 90%)\n3. Evaluate likelihood of each based on symptom severity and prevalence: pneumonia most likely (Confidence: 85%)\n4. Final diagnosis: Pneumonia (Overall Confidence: 80%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SSUE; Step 1: Scaffold Mapping)": "Patient presents with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. What is the most likely diagnosis? Map your response to the following scaffold:\n- Respiratory System\n  - Upper Respiratory\n  - Lower Respiratory\n    - Lungs\n    - Bronchi\n- Symptoms\n  - Fever\n  - Cough\n  - Shortness of Breath\n- Potential Diagnoses\n  - Pneumonia\n  - Bronchitis\n  - COVID-19",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SSUE; Step 1: Scaffold Mapping)": "Mapped response:\n- Respiratory System\n  - Lower Respiratory\n    - Lungs: Likely affected\n    - Bronchi: Possibly affected\n- Symptoms\n  - Fever: Present\n  - Cough: Present\n  - Shortness of Breath: Present\n- Potential Diagnoses\n  - Pneumonia: Most likely\n  - Bronchitis: Possible but less likely\n  - COVID-19: Cannot be ruled out",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SSUE; Step 2: Node-level Confidence)": "For each node in the scaffold, provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (SSUE; Step 2: Node-level Confidence)": "- Respiratory System: 90 (Symptoms clearly indicate respiratory involvement)\n  - Lower Respiratory: 85 (Shortness of breath suggests lower respiratory involvement)\n    - Lungs: 80 (Consistent with pneumonia, but other causes possible)\n    - Bronchi: 70 (Could be involved, but less certain)\n- Symptoms\n  - Fever: 95 (Clearly stated in patient presentation)\n  - Cough: 95 (Clearly stated in patient presentation)\n  - Shortness of Breath: 95 (Clearly stated in patient presentation)\n- Potential Diagnoses\n  - Pneumonia: 80 (Most consistent with symptoms, but not certain)\n  - Bronchitis: 60 (Possible, but less likely given shortness of breath)\n  - COVID-19: 70 (Cannot be ruled out, symptoms overlap)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SSUE; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Based on the lower-level confidence scores, synthesize higher-level confidence scores for each parent node.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (SSUE; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "- Respiratory System: 88 (Average of Lower Respiratory and Symptoms)\n  - Lower Respiratory: 75 (Average of Lungs and Bronchi)\n- Symptoms: 95 (Average of individual symptoms)\n- Potential Diagnoses: 70 (Weighted average, considering Pneumonia as most likely)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SSUE; Step 4: Final Response)": "Generate a final response that incorporates the structured uncertainty information from the scaffold.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (SSUE; Step 4: Final Response)": "Based on the patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, the most likely diagnosis is pneumonia (80% confidence). This primarily affects the lower respiratory system (85% confidence), particularly the lungs (80% confidence). While we're highly confident about the presence of the reported symptoms (95% confidence), there's some uncertainty in the final diagnosis. Bronchitis is a less likely alternative (60% confidence), and COVID-19 cannot be ruled out (70% confidence) due to overlapping symptoms. Further tests, such as a chest X-ray or COVID-19 test, would be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.",
            "explanation": "The SSUE method provides a more nuanced and structured uncertainty estimation compared to the baselines. It breaks down the confidence levels across different aspects of the diagnosis, aligning with the semantic structure of medical reasoning. This allows for a more detailed understanding of where the model is most and least confident in its diagnosis, potentially leading to more informed decision-making."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SSUE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the relationship between scaffold granularity and performance. We could experiment with different levels of detail in the semantic scaffolds to find an optimal balance between structure and simplicity.\n2. Investigate the model's ability to generate appropriate semantic scaffolds for different domains. This could lead to insights about the model's understanding of domain structures and how it relates to uncertainty estimation.\n3. Explore how different prompting strategies for each step of SSUE affect the final uncertainty estimates. This could provide valuable insights into prompt engineering for structured reasoning tasks.\n4. Analyze cases where SSUE performs poorly compared to baselines. This might reveal specific types of queries or domains where structured uncertainty estimation is less effective, leading to a more nuanced understanding of when to apply such methods.\n5. Investigate how SSUE performs across different model sizes and architectures. This could provide insights into how model capacity relates to the ability to leverage semantic structures for uncertainty estimation."
