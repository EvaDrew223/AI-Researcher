        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when dealing with complex, multi-faceted queries that require understanding at various levels of abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty at a single level of abstraction, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty that arise from the interplay between general principles and specific details.",
        "Motivation": "By recursively decomposing a query into increasingly abstract concepts and then reassembling these abstractions, we can uncover uncertainties that emerge at different levels of conceptual hierarchy.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Abstraction for Uncertainty Estimation, a hierarchical prompting technique that explores uncertainty across multiple levels of abstraction. The process involves: 1) Given an initial query, prompt the model to answer and provide a confidence score. 2) Then, instruct the model to identify the key concepts or principles underlying the query: \"What are the 3-5 most fundamental concepts or principles needed to answer this question?\" 3) For each identified concept, repeat steps 1-2, creating a tree of increasingly abstract concepts. 4) Once a sufficient level of abstraction is reached (or the model indicates it can't abstract further), prompt the model to reassess its confidence for each abstract concept. 5) Finally, guide the model to recursively reconstruct its understanding and uncertainty estimation from the bottom up: \"Considering your confidence in each abstract concept and how they relate to each other, reassess your confidence in the original query.\" The pattern of confidence scores across the abstraction hierarchy and the model's ability to consistently reason across levels of abstraction provide a nuanced measure of uncertainty that captures both detailed and high-level understanding.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test this method on a range of complex queries from fields like science, philosophy, and interdisciplinary problems. Compare against standard uncertainty estimation methods using metrics such as hierarchical calibration error (how well confidence scores align across levels of abstraction), correlation with human expert judgments of query complexity, and performance on identifying knowledge gaps at different levels of abstraction. Evaluate the method's ability to distinguish between uncertainties arising from specific details versus fundamental conceptual misunderstandings."

        "Title": "Recursive Abstraction for Uncertainty Estimation: Hierarchical Prompting for Calibrated Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when dealing with complex, multi-faceted queries that require understanding at various levels of abstraction. Current approaches typically assess uncertainty at a single level of abstraction, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty that arise from the interplay between general principles and specific details.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs often focus on a single level of abstraction, which can lead to overconfidence or underconfidence in complex scenarios. By recursively decomposing a query into increasingly abstract concepts and then reassembling these abstractions, we can uncover uncertainties that emerge at different levels of conceptual hierarchy. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where we often break down complex problems into simpler components and reason about our confidence at each level before synthesizing an overall judgment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Abstraction for Uncertainty Estimation (RAUE), a hierarchical prompting technique that explores uncertainty across multiple levels of abstraction. The process involves five main steps: 1) Given an initial query, prompt the model to answer and provide a confidence score. 2) Instruct the model to identify the key concepts or principles underlying the query. 3) For each identified concept, repeat steps 1-2, creating a tree of increasingly abstract concepts. 4) Once a sufficient level of abstraction is reached, prompt the model to reassess its confidence for each abstract concept. 5) Guide the model to recursively reconstruct its understanding and uncertainty estimation from the bottom up, considering the confidence in each abstract concept and how they relate to each other.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of complex queries from fields like science, philosophy, and interdisciplinary problems. Specifically, we will use: a) A subset of the TruthfulQA dataset for scientific and philosophical questions. b) A curated set of multi-hop reasoning questions from HotpotQA. c) A selection of complex, open-ended questions from the BIG-bench task suite.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods for uncertainty estimation: a) Direct prompting with confidence score request. b) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation. c) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using different model checkpoints or temperatures.",
            "Step 3: RAUE Implementation": "Implement the RAUE method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response and confidence generation. b) Key concept identification. c) Recursive abstraction and confidence estimation. d) Bottom-up reconstruction of confidence. Use few-shot prompting with carefully designed examples to guide the model through each step.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each query in our dataset: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their confidence estimates. b) Apply the RAUE method, recording the confidence estimates at each level of abstraction and the final reconstructed confidence. c) For a subset of queries, manually analyze the abstraction tree and confidence estimates to gain qualitative insights.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance: a) Calibration error: Compare the predicted confidence with actual performance across different confidence levels. b) Hierarchical calibration error: Assess how well confidence scores align across levels of abstraction. c) Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between model confidence and human expert judgments of query complexity. d) Precision-Recall AUC for identifying knowledge gaps at different levels of abstraction.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct the following analyses: a) Compare RAUE performance against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze how the abstraction depth affects confidence estimation accuracy. c) Investigate patterns in how confidence changes across levels of abstraction. d) Examine cases where RAUE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Quantum computing has the potential to break many current cryptographic systems, particularly those based on factoring large numbers or discrete logarithms, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. This could render much of our current digital security infrastructure vulnerable.

This will drive a shift towards post-quantum cryptography algorithms. However, the timeline for when large-scale quantum computers will be available is uncertain, which affects the urgency of this transition. The societal and economic impacts of these changes are also not fully understood. While we can be confident about the need for new cryptographic approaches, the specific long-term effects and their timing are less certain.\n\nRevised confidence score: 78"
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RAUE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why the method fails, which could provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning and uncertainty estimation. 2) Explore variations of the RAUE method, such as different abstraction strategies or alternative ways of combining confidence scores across levels. 3) Investigate how the abstraction process itself, regardless of confidence estimation, affects the quality and factuality of LLM outputs. 4) Analyze the relationship between abstraction depth and task complexity, which could inform future prompt engineering strategies. 5) Examine how different LLMs perform in the abstraction process, potentially revealing insights into their knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities."
