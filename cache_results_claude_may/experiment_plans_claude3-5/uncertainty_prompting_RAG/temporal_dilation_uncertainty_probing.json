        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation techniques for LLMs often fail to account for how confidence might change over different time scales or with varying amounts of computation time.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods provide static uncertainty estimates or use simple time-based sampling techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of time dilation in physics and the human experience of varying confidence over time, we propose a method that probes model uncertainty across different simulated time scales.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Dilation Uncertainty Probing (TDUP). The process involves prompting the LLM to imagine responding to the query under different time constraints, from split-second decisions to careful deliberation over extended periods. We then prompt the model to generate responses and confidence estimates for each time scale. Additionally, we introduce 'temporal interventions' where we ask the model to consider how new information or realizations might emerge over time. By analyzing the variance and trends in responses and confidence across these dilated time scales, we construct a dynamic uncertainty profile that captures how the model's certainty evolves with simulated computation time.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare TDUP with standard uncertainty estimation methods on a range of tasks including rapid decision-making scenarios, long-form analysis, and evolving situation assessments. Evaluate using time-sensitive calibration metrics, analysis of uncertainty dynamics, and assessment of the method's ability to predict performance improvements with increased computation time."

        "Title": "Temporal Dilation Uncertainty Probing: Quantifying LLM Confidence Across Simulated Time Scales",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for how confidence might change over different time scales or with varying amounts of computation time. This limitation hinders our understanding of how LLM certainty evolves and potentially impacts the reliability of their outputs in time-sensitive scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically provide static uncertainty estimates or use simple time-based sampling techniques, which do not capture the dynamic nature of confidence across different temporal contexts. Inspired by the concept of time dilation in physics and the human experience of varying confidence over time, we propose a method that probes model uncertainty across different simulated time scales. This approach aims to provide a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of LLM confidence, potentially leading to more reliable and context-aware uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Dilation Uncertainty Probing (TDUP), a novel method to assess LLM uncertainty across simulated time scales. The process involves:\n1. Prompting the LLM to imagine responding to a query under different time constraints, ranging from split-second decisions to careful deliberation over extended periods.\n2. Generating responses and confidence estimates for each time scale.\n3. Introducing 'temporal interventions' where we ask the model to consider how new information or realizations might emerge over time.\n4. Analyzing the variance and trends in responses and confidence across these dilated time scales to construct a dynamic uncertainty profile.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse set of tasks from existing benchmarks that cover different types of reasoning and knowledge retrieval. We will use:\n- TruthfulQA for factual question answering\n- GSM8K for mathematical reasoning\n- ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning\n- LAMBADA for language modeling and common sense reasoning",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods as baselines:\n1. Temperature scaling\n2. Ensemble methods (using different seeds)\n3. Monte Carlo Dropout\n4. Deep Ensembles",
            "Step 3: TDUP Implementation": "Implement the TDUP method:\n1. Design prompts for different time scales (e.g., '1 second', '10 seconds', '1 minute', '10 minutes', '1 hour', '1 day')\n2. Create prompts for temporal interventions (e.g., 'What new information might you consider if given more time?')\n3. Develop a pipeline to generate responses and confidence estimates for each time scale\n4. Implement analysis tools to track changes in responses and confidence across time scales",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task in the dataset:\n1. Apply baseline methods to get uncertainty estimates\n2. Apply TDUP method:\n   a. Generate responses and confidence estimates for each time scale\n   b. Apply temporal interventions and generate updated responses and confidence estimates\n   c. Analyze changes in responses and confidence across time scales",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "1. Compare TDUP results with baseline methods using:\n   a. Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error)\n   b. Spearman's rank correlation between confidence and correctness\n   c. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)\n2. Analyze uncertainty dynamics:\n   a. Plot confidence trends across time scales\n   b. Identify patterns in response changes due to temporal interventions\n3. Assess TDUP's ability to predict performance improvements with increased computation time",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Interpretation": "1. Examine how uncertainty profiles differ across task types\n2. Investigate the impact of temporal interventions on confidence and response quality\n3. Analyze the relationship between simulated time scales and actual computation time\n4. Identify scenarios where TDUP provides more informative uncertainty estimates than baselines"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nHow confident are you in this answer?",
                "Output": "I am 95% confident in this answer.",
                "Explanation": "Standard methods typically provide a single confidence score without considering temporal aspects."
            },
            "TDUP Method Example": {
                "Input": "If you had 1 hour to research, what new information might you consider?",
                "Output": "I might consider:\n1. Verifying the current status of Paris as the capital\n2. Checking if there have been any recent changes in government structure\n3. Researching the history of French capitals\n4. Looking into any potential plans for moving the capital\nHowever, I'm still 99.9% confident that Paris is the current capital of France.",
                "Explanation": "TDUP provides a dynamic profile of confidence across time scales and allows for consideration of potential new information, offering a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TDUP does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Conduct an in-depth analysis of how different types of questions and tasks affect the temporal dynamics of uncertainty. This could reveal insights into the model's reasoning process and potential limitations.\n2. Investigate the relationship between simulated time scales and actual computation time or model size. This could provide valuable insights into the scalability and efficiency of language models.\n3. Explore how TDUP could be used as a tool for detecting potential hallucinations or inconsistencies in model outputs by analyzing changes in confidence and responses over time.\n4. Develop a hybrid method that combines TDUP with existing uncertainty estimation techniques to leverage the strengths of both approaches.\n5. Investigate how TDUP could be used to improve prompt engineering or few-shot learning by identifying optimal 'reflection times' for different types of tasks."
