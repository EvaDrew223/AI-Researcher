    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates for complex, multi-faceted questions that require reasoning across multiple domains or steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-step confidence estimation or basic ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down complex questions into simpler sub-components and recursively estimating confidence for each part, we can potentially achieve more accurate and interpretable overall confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Decomposition (RCD), a novel prompting technique that iteratively breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-questions. For each sub-question, the model is prompted to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. These sub-confidences are then aggregated using a weighted geometric mean, where weights are determined by the relative importance of each sub-question (also estimated by the model). The process continues recursively until reaching atomic questions or a predefined depth. The final prompt includes a meta-analysis step where the model reflects on the decomposition process and adjusts the final confidence estimate accordingly.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RCD against standard prompting, ensemble methods, and existing confidence calibration techniques on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MMLU and BigBench. Evaluate using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score, as well as qualitative analysis of the decomposition trees produced."

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Decomposition: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates for complex, multi-faceted questions that require reasoning across multiple domains or steps. This issue can lead to overconfident incorrect answers or underconfident correct answers, potentially misleading users and limiting the models' reliability in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on single-step confidence estimation or basic ensemble methods, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks. By breaking down complex questions into simpler sub-components and recursively estimating confidence for each part, we can potentially achieve more accurate and interpretable overall confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts and assessing our confidence in each step.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Decomposition (RCD), a novel prompting technique that iteratively breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-questions. The method works as follows:\n1. Given a complex query, prompt the LLM to decompose it into simpler sub-questions.\n2. For each sub-question, prompt the LLM to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate (0-100%).\n3. Prompt the LLM to estimate the relative importance (0-100%) of each sub-question to the overall query.\n4. Aggregate the sub-confidences using a weighted geometric mean, where weights are determined by the relative importance of each sub-question.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 recursively for any sub-questions that are still too complex, until reaching atomic questions or a predefined depth.\n6. Include a meta-analysis step where the LLM reflects on the decomposition process and adjusts the final confidence estimate accordingly.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MMLU (focusing on subjects that require multi-step reasoning, such as science, math, and logic) and BigBench (selecting tasks that involve multi-hop reasoning or interdisciplinary knowledge). Create a test set of 1000 questions from these datasets, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\na) Standard prompting: Direct question-answering without explicit confidence estimation.\nb) Single-step confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each prompt.\nc) Ensemble method: Use 5 different prompts for each question and aggregate results.",
            "Step 3: RCD Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Confidence Decomposition method:\na) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down this question into 2-5 simpler sub-questions that, when answered, would help solve the main question.'\nb) Sub-question answering prompt: 'Answer this sub-question and provide your confidence in the answer (0-100%).'\nc) Importance estimation prompt: 'Assign a relative importance (0-100%) to each sub-question in solving the main question.'\nd) Aggregation: Implement the weighted geometric mean calculation.\ne) Meta-analysis prompt: 'Reflect on the decomposition process and adjust the final confidence if necessary. Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all methods. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-2 to assess generalizability.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each question in the test set:\na) Run all baseline methods and RCD.\nb) Record the predicted answer, confidence estimate, and actual correctness.\nc) Calculate evaluation metrics:\n   - Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers\n   - Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n   - Brier Score\n   - Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)\nd) For RCD, also record the decomposition structure and intermediate confidences.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Compare RCD against baselines using the calculated metrics.\nb) Analyze the decomposition structures:\n   - Average depth of decomposition\n   - Correlation between decomposition depth and question difficulty\n   - Common patterns in effective decompositions\nc) Examine cases where RCD significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.\nd) Assess the impact of the meta-analysis step on final confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "a) Test RCD without the importance weighting step.\nb) Vary the maximum allowed decomposition depth.\nc) Compare against a version that uses arithmetic mean instead of geometric mean for aggregation.",
            "Step 8: Generalization Tests": "a) Apply RCD to a set of novel, real-world complex questions not from standard datasets.\nb) Test on a subset of questions from domains not well-represented in the training data."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "What would be the environmental impact if global average temperatures rose by 3\u00b0C by 2100?",
                "Baseline Prompt Output": "If global average temperatures rose by 3\u00b0C by 2100, the environmental impact would be severe and wide-ranging. Some key effects would include:\n1. Sea level rise\n2. More frequent and intense extreme weather events\n3. Disruption of ecosystems and biodiversity loss\n4. Changes in precipitation patterns\n5. Ocean acidification\n\nConfidence: 90%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a reasonable answer but fails to capture the uncertainty in long-term climate predictions and the complex interplay of various factors. The 90% confidence is likely an overestimate given the complexity of the question."
            },
            "Example 2 (RCD Success)": {
                "Input": "What would be the environmental impact if global average temperatures rose by 3\u00b0C by 2100?",
                "RCD Step 1 (Decomposition)": "Sub-questions:\n1. What is the projected sea level rise with a 3\u00b0C temperature increase?\n2. How would extreme weather patterns change?\n3. What would be the impact on biodiversity and ecosystems?\n4. How would agriculture and food production be affected?\n5. What would be the effect on water resources and precipitation patterns?",
                "RCD Step 2 (Sub-question Answering)": "1. Sea level rise: Projected to be between 0.5 to 1.5 meters by 2100. Confidence: 75%\n2. Extreme weather: More frequent and intense hurricanes, heatwaves, and droughts. Confidence: 80%\n3. Biodiversity impact: Significant species extinctions and ecosystem disruptions. Confidence: 70%\n4. Agriculture effect: Crop yields would decrease in many regions, especially near the equator. Confidence: 65%\n5. Water resources: Increased water scarcity in some regions, flooding in others. Confidence: 60%",
                "RCD Step 3 (Importance Weighting)": "1. Sea level rise: 25%\n2. Extreme weather: 20%\n3. Biodiversity impact: 20%\n4. Agriculture effect: 20%\n5. Water resources: 15%",
                "RCD Step 4 (Aggregation)": "Weighted geometric mean confidence: 70.5%",
                "RCD Step 5 (Meta-analysis)": "The decomposition process reveals significant uncertainties in each aspect of climate change impacts. The interplay between these factors adds additional uncertainty. Considering this, I would adjust the final confidence slightly downward.\n\nFinal confidence: 65%",
                "RCD Final Output": "If global average temperatures rose by 3\u00b0C by 2100, the environmental impact would be severe and multi-faceted:\n1. Sea levels are projected to rise between 0.5 to 1.5 meters.\n2. Extreme weather events like hurricanes, heatwaves, and droughts would become more frequent and intense.\n3. Significant biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruptions are expected.\n4. Agricultural productivity would likely decrease, especially in equatorial regions.\n5. Water resources would be significantly affected, with increased scarcity in some areas and flooding in others.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these projections involve considerable uncertainty due to the complex interactions between various climate systems and potential feedback loops.\n\nConfidence: 65%",
                "Explanation": "RCD provides a more nuanced and detailed answer, with a more realistic confidence estimate. The decomposition allows for a clearer understanding of the uncertainties in each aspect of the problem, and the meta-analysis step helps in adjusting the final confidence to account for the complexity of the interacting factors."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RCD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the decomposition structures to understand how LLMs break down complex problems. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential limitations.\n2. Investigate the relationship between question complexity and the effectiveness of decomposition. This could lead to a method for predicting when decomposition is likely to be beneficial.\n3. Examine the confidence estimates at each level of decomposition to understand how uncertainty propagates through multi-step reasoning processes.\n4. Compare the decompositions generated by different LLMs to identify strengths and weaknesses of various models in complex reasoning tasks.\n5. Develop a hybrid method that combines RCD with other techniques like chain-of-thought prompting or external knowledge retrieval, potentially leading to a more robust confidence estimation approach.\n6. Focus on improving the meta-analysis step, potentially training a separate model to calibrate the final confidence based on the decomposition structure and intermediate confidences."
