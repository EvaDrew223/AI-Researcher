        "Problem": "LLMs often provide a single confidence score without insight into the various factors contributing to their uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on eliciting a single confidence score or using internal model probabilities.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to break down its confidence into multiple metacognitive components, we can obtain a more nuanced understanding of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a structured prompting approach that asks the model to decompose its confidence into several metacognitive factors: 1) Prompt the model to rate its confidence in understanding the query. 2) Ask it to assess the completeness of its knowledge relevant to the query. 3) Request an evaluation of its reasoning process reliability. 4) Prompt for an estimate of potential ambiguities or multiple valid interpretations. 5) Finally, ask the model to synthesize these factors into an overall confidence score, explaining how each factor contributes to the final estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Apply this method to a diverse set of tasks, including factual QA, logical reasoning, and open-ended generation. Compare against standard confidence elicitation methods. Evaluate not only overall calibration but also the correlation between individual metacognitive factors and actual performance."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Decomposition: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single confidence score without insight into the various factors contributing to their uncertainty. This simplistic approach fails to capture the nuanced nature of model uncertainty and limits our ability to interpret and improve model performance.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on eliciting a single confidence score or using internal model probabilities. These methods do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's uncertainty. By prompting the model to break down its confidence into multiple metacognitive components, we can obtain a more nuanced understanding of the model's uncertainty. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often consider various factors when assessing our confidence in a decision or answer.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a structured prompting approach that asks the model to decompose its confidence into several metacognitive factors: 1) Prompt the model to rate its confidence in understanding the query. 2) Ask it to assess the completeness of its knowledge relevant to the query. 3) Request an evaluation of its reasoning process reliability. 4) Prompt for an estimate of potential ambiguities or multiple valid interpretations. 5) Finally, ask the model to synthesize these factors into an overall confidence score, explaining how each factor contributes to the final estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use three diverse datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baselines: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. b) Probability-based confidence: Use the model's output probability for the generated answer as a confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Metacognitive Decomposition Implementation": "Implement our proposed method using the following prompt structure: 'Question: {question}\nAnswer: {answer}\nNow, let's break down your confidence in this answer:\n1. Understanding: Rate your confidence in understanding the question (0-100).\n2. Knowledge: Assess the completeness of your relevant knowledge (0-100).\n3. Reasoning: Evaluate the reliability of your reasoning process (0-100).\n4. Ambiguity: Estimate the potential for multiple valid interpretations (0-100).\n5. Overall Confidence: Synthesize these factors into an overall confidence score (0-100) and explain how each factor contributes.'",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each dataset, process all questions through both baseline methods and our proposed method. Store the questions, answers, confidence scores, and metacognitive breakdowns.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence to its actual performance. b) Spearman's rank correlation: Measure the correlation between confidence scores and correctness. c) AUC-ROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the baseline methods and our proposed method across all datasets and metrics. Analyze the contribution of each metacognitive factor to the overall confidence score and its correlation with answer correctness.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Study": "Conduct an ablation study by removing each metacognitive factor one at a time and observing the impact on performance metrics.",
            "Step 9: Qualitative Analysis": "Manually review a subset of examples to gain insights into how the model decomposes its confidence and how this relates to answer correctness."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence)": "95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Metacognitive Decomposition)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nNow, let's break down your confidence in this answer:\n1. Understanding: Rate your confidence in understanding the question (0-100).\n2. Knowledge: Assess the completeness of your relevant knowledge (0-100).\n3. Reasoning: Evaluate the reliability of your reasoning process (0-100).\n4. Ambiguity: Estimate the potential for multiple valid interpretations (0-100).\n5. Overall Confidence: Synthesize these factors into an overall confidence score (0-100) and explain how each factor contributes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Metacognitive Decomposition)": "1. Understanding: 100 - The question is straightforward and clear.\n2. Knowledge: 100 - I have complete knowledge about the capital of France.\n3. Reasoning: 100 - No complex reasoning is required for this factual question.\n4. Ambiguity: 0 - There is no ambiguity in the question or potential for multiple interpretations.\n5. Overall Confidence: 100 - All factors contribute to high confidence. The question is clear, my knowledge is complete, no complex reasoning is needed, and there's no ambiguity. This results in maximum confidence in the answer.",
            "Explanation": "The metacognitive decomposition provides a more detailed and interpretable confidence assessment compared to the single score from the baseline method. It allows us to understand the factors contributing to the model's high confidence in this case."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed metacognitive decomposition method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the relationship between different metacognitive factors and answer correctness across various question types. This could provide insights into which factors are most predictive of correctness in different contexts. 2) Investigate whether the metacognitive decomposition reveals any systematic biases or weaknesses in the model's confidence assessment. For example, we might find that the model consistently overestimates its understanding of certain types of questions. 3) Explore whether the metacognitive decomposition can be used to improve the model's performance through a self-reflection process. We could prompt the model to revise its answers based on low scores in specific metacognitive factors. 4) Develop a hybrid approach that combines our metacognitive decomposition with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or Monte Carlo dropout, to see if we can achieve better calibration and interpretability."
