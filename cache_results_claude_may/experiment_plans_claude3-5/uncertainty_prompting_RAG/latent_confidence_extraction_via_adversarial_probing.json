    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for extracting confidence estimates from language models often rely on explicit verbal expressions, which may not accurately reflect the model's internal uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches focus on prompting the model to directly state its confidence or use simple heuristics based on output probabilities.",
        "Motivation": "By employing adversarial techniques, we can potentially uncover more nuanced and accurate representations of the model's latent confidence, even when it's not explicitly expressed.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage adversarial probing framework. In the first stage, we train a 'confidence extractor' neural network that takes as input the hidden states of the language model and attempts to predict its true confidence. Simultaneously, we fine-tune the language model to resist this extraction, encouraging it to encode confidence information more subtly. In the second stage, we use the trained extractor to probe the model on new tasks, revealing latent confidence estimates. We also introduce a novel 'confidence consistency' loss that encourages the extracted confidence to be coherent across semantically similar inputs.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will compare our method against traditional confidence elicitation techniques on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Evaluation metrics will include calibration error, confidence-performance correlation, and a new measure of 'extraction resilience' that quantifies how well the confidence information resists adversarial attacks."

        "Title": "Adversarial Probing for Latent Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for extracting confidence estimates from language models often rely on explicit verbal expressions or simple heuristics based on output probabilities, which may not accurately reflect the model's internal uncertainty. This project aims to develop a more nuanced and accurate method for quantifying uncertainty in large language models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in language models are limited by their reliance on explicit expressions or simplistic heuristics. These approaches may not capture the full complexity of a model's internal uncertainty representations. By employing adversarial techniques, we can potentially uncover more subtle and accurate representations of the model's latent confidence, even when it's not explicitly expressed. This approach is inspired by recent advances in adversarial probing and the idea that models may encode information in ways that are not immediately apparent through standard prompting techniques.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage adversarial probing framework for latent confidence estimation:\n1. Training Stage:\n   a. Initialize a 'confidence extractor' neural network that takes as input the hidden states of the language model.\n   b. Train the extractor to predict the model's true confidence on a set of calibrated tasks.\n   c. Simultaneously, fine-tune the language model to resist this extraction, encouraging it to encode confidence information more subtly.\n   d. Iterate this process until convergence, creating a robust extractor and a model with well-distributed latent confidence information.\n2. Inference Stage:\n   a. Use the trained extractor to probe the model on new tasks, revealing latent confidence estimates.\n   b. Implement a novel 'confidence consistency' loss that encourages the extracted confidence to be coherent across semantically similar inputs.\n   c. Aggregate multiple probing results to produce a final confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Data Preparation": "1. Select a diverse set of NLP tasks for training and evaluation, including question answering (e.g., SQuAD), sentiment analysis (e.g., SST-2), and natural language inference (e.g., MNLI).\n2. Create a calibrated dataset by annotating a subset of examples with human-judged confidence scores.\n3. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "1. Choose a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) as the base model.\n2. Implement API calls to access the model's hidden states and output probabilities.\n3. Design and implement the confidence extractor network architecture.",
            "Step 3: Training Stage": "1. Initialize the confidence extractor network.\n2. For each training iteration:\n   a. Sample a batch of examples from the calibrated dataset.\n   b. Generate model outputs and extract hidden states.\n   c. Train the extractor to predict calibrated confidence scores.\n   d. Update the language model to resist extraction (if using a fine-tunable model).\n   e. Implement and apply the confidence consistency loss.\n3. Monitor performance on the validation set and stop training when convergence is reached.",
            "Step 4: Inference Stage": "1. Implement the inference pipeline using the trained extractor.\n2. For each test example:\n   a. Generate model output and extract hidden states.\n   b. Use the trained extractor to estimate confidence.\n   c. Apply confidence consistency regularization.\n3. Aggregate multiple probing results for a final confidence estimate.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "1. Compare the proposed method against baselines:\n   a. Direct verbal confidence elicitation\n   b. Output probability-based heuristics\n   c. Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation\n2. Evaluate using metrics:\n   a. Calibration error\n   b. Confidence-performance correlation\n   c. Extraction resilience (measure of how well confidence resists adversarial attacks)\n3. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of each component (e.g., adversarial training, consistency loss).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1. Visualize the distribution of extracted confidence scores across different tasks and input types.\n2. Analyze cases where the proposed method significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.\n3. Investigate the relationship between extracted confidence and model performance on out-of-distribution samples."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also state your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. My confidence in this answer is 95 out of 100.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method relies on explicit verbal expression of confidence, which may not accurately reflect the model's true uncertainty."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Intermediate Steps": "1. Generate model output: 'The capital of France is Paris.'\n2. Extract hidden states from the model.\n3. Apply trained confidence extractor to hidden states.\n4. Apply confidence consistency regularization.\n5. Aggregate multiple probing results.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. [Extracted Confidence: 0.97]",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method extracts a latent confidence score without relying on explicit verbal expressions. This score may more accurately reflect the model's true uncertainty, considering subtle patterns in the hidden states and maintaining consistency across similar inputs."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed adversarial probing method does not yield significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the learned extractor to understand what patterns it's identifying in the hidden states. This could provide insights into how language models encode uncertainty, even if our extraction method isn't optimal. Second, we could explore alternative architectures for the extractor, such as attention-based models or graph neural networks, which might be better suited to capture complex uncertainty patterns. Third, we could investigate the relationship between extracted confidence and other model behaviors, such as sensitivity to adversarial attacks or performance on out-of-distribution samples. This could lead to a paper focused on analyzing and characterizing uncertainty in language models, rather than improving confidence estimation directly. Finally, we could expand the scope to include multi-task learning, exploring how confidence transfers across different types of NLP tasks, which could yield insights into the generalization of uncertainty representation in language models."
