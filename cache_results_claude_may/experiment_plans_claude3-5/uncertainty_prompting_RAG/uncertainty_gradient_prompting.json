    "idea_name": "Uncertainty Gradient Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, leading to overconfident responses in situations where they should express doubt.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting and calibrated temperature sampling have shown limited success in addressing this issue.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by gradient descent in optimization, we hypothesize that iteratively refining a model's confidence through targeted prompting can lead to more accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Gradient Prompting (UGP), a novel technique that iteratively probes the model's confidence landscape. UGP starts with an initial response and confidence estimate, then generates a series of targeted follow-up questions designed to challenge or support the model's stance. Each iteration adjusts the confidence estimate based on the model's ability to defend or modify its position. The process continues until the confidence converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached. Prompts are dynamically generated to explore areas of potential uncertainty, such as requesting counter-arguments, asking for supporting evidence, or probing edge cases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UGP against standard few-shot prompting and calibrated temperature sampling on a diverse set of tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and ethical dilemmas. Metrics will include calibration error, Brier score, and correlation between expressed confidence and human expert ratings of answer quality."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Gradient Prompting: Iterative Refinement for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, leading to overconfident responses in situations where they should express doubt. This issue can result in the propagation of misinformation and unreliable decision-making when these models are used in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting and calibrated temperature sampling have shown limited success in addressing the uncertainty quantification problem. Inspired by gradient descent in optimization, we hypothesize that iteratively refining a model's confidence through targeted prompting can lead to more accurate uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to challenge and refine its initial confidence estimates, potentially leading to more reliable and well-calibrated outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Gradient Prompting (UGP), a novel technique that iteratively probes the model's confidence landscape. UGP starts with an initial response and confidence estimate, then generates a series of targeted follow-up questions designed to challenge or support the model's stance.

The process continues until the confidence converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached. Prompts are dynamically generated to explore areas of potential uncertainty, such as requesting counter-arguments, asking for supporting evidence, or probing edge cases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) MoralQA for ethical dilemmas. Split each dataset into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (a) Standard few-shot prompting, (b) Calibrated temperature sampling, and (c) Monte Carlo Dropout. For each method, generate responses and confidence scores for the test set.",
            "Step 3: UGP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Gradient Prompting method: (a) Generate initial response and confidence score, (b) Generate targeted follow-up questions, (c) Update confidence based on model's ability to defend its stance, (d) Repeat steps b and c until convergence or max iterations.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning": "Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters such as the number of iterations, learning rate for confidence updates, and threshold for convergence.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate all methods on the test set using the following metrics: (a) Calibration error, (b) Brier score, (c) Correlation between expressed confidence and human expert ratings of answer quality.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: (a) Compare UGP performance across different types of questions, (b) Analyze the trajectory of confidence scores during iterations, (c) Examine the types of follow-up questions generated and their effectiveness."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UGP Step 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your initial confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UGP Step 1)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UGP Step 2)": "Generate a follow-up question that challenges the previous answer or tests its limits.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UGP Step 2)": "Q: Are there any historical periods when Paris was not the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UGP Step 3)": "Please answer the follow-up question and update your confidence level if necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UGP Step 3)": "A: Yes, there were periods when Paris was not the capital of France. For example, during the Hundred Years' War, the capital was moved to Bourges. During World War II, Vichy became the de facto capital of the French State. Given this historical context, I would update my confidence level. Updated confidence: 85%",
            "Explanation": "The UGP method allows for a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence assessment by considering additional relevant information and potential exceptions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UGP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why the method failed and what it reveals about LLMs' uncertainty reasoning. We could investigate: (1) The types of questions where UGP performs well or poorly, potentially uncovering patterns in LLMs' uncertainty blind spots. (2) Analyze the generated follow-up questions to understand if the model is capable of producing truly challenging queries. (3) Examine the confidence trajectory over iterations to see if there are consistent patterns (e.g., always decreasing, oscillating) that might indicate limitations in the model's ability to refine its uncertainty estimates. (4) Compare the performance across different model sizes and architectures to understand if the ability to refine uncertainty estimates correlates with model scale or training approach. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty reasoning in LLMs and guide future research directions in improving their calibration and reliability."
