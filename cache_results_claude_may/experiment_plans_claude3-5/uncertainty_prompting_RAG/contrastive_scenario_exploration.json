    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with novel or ambiguous scenarios, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct prompting for confidence or analyzing model logits, which may not capture nuanced uncertainties in complex scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often assess their confidence by considering alternative scenarios or interpretations. We aim to mimic this process in language models to improve uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Scenario Exploration, a prompting technique that generates and explores multiple contrasting scenarios to better estimate model uncertainty. The method involves three main steps: 1) Scenario Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple alternative interpretations or scenarios related to the input query. 2) Contrastive Analysis: For each scenario, prompt the model to answer the original query and provide a confidence estimate. 3) Uncertainty Synthesis: Aggregate the confidence estimates and analyze the diversity of answers across scenarios to produce a final uncertainty score. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to consider a wide range of possibilities and potential misinterpretations, leading to more nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on ambiguous questions from datasets like AmbigQA and compare it with standard uncertainty quantification techniques. We'll assess performance using metrics such as calibration error, accuracy-confidence correlation, and a new metric we call 'scenario diversity score' to measure the breadth of explored possibilities."

        "Title": "Contrastive Scenario Exploration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with novel or ambiguous scenarios, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers. This issue is particularly problematic in high-stakes applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial for decision-making and trust.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct prompting for confidence or analyzing model logits, which may not capture nuanced uncertainties in complex scenarios. Humans often assess their confidence by considering alternative scenarios or interpretations. We aim to mimic this process in language models to improve uncertainty quantification. By exploring multiple contrasting scenarios, we hypothesize that LLMs can develop a more comprehensive understanding of their own uncertainty, leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Scenario Exploration (CSE), a prompting technique that generates and explores multiple contrasting scenarios to better estimate model uncertainty. The method involves three main steps: 1) Scenario Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple alternative interpretations or scenarios related to the input query. 2) Contrastive Analysis: For each scenario, prompt the model to answer the original query and provide a confidence estimate. 3) Uncertainty Synthesis: Aggregate the confidence estimates and analyze the diversity of answers across scenarios to produce a final uncertainty score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the AmbigQA dataset, which contains ambiguous questions with multiple valid interpretations. We will also create a subset of unambiguous questions from existing QA datasets like SQuAD for comparison.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification techniques: a) Direct confidence prompting: Ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to generate multiple answers and calculate uncertainty based on their variance. c) Ensemble method: Use different few-shot prompts to generate multiple answers and calculate uncertainty based on their agreement.",
            "Step 3: Contrastive Scenario Exploration Implementation": "a) Scenario Generation: Prompt: 'Given the question \"{question}\", generate 3 different interpretations or scenarios that could lead to different answers. Label them as Scenario 1, Scenario 2, and Scenario 3.' b) Contrastive Analysis: For each scenario, use the prompt: 'Consider Scenario {i}: {scenario}. Based on this interpretation, answer the original question \"{question}\" and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.' c) Uncertainty Synthesis: Calculate the final uncertainty score using the formula: 1 - (average confidence * (1 - standard deviation of confidences) * (1 - answer diversity score)). The answer diversity score is calculated using the Levenshtein distance between answers, normalized to [0, 1].",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "a) Calibration Error: Calculate the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for each method. b) Accuracy-Confidence Correlation: Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between model accuracy and confidence. c) Scenario Diversity Score: Measure the semantic diversity of generated scenarios using embedding-based similarity. d) Ambiguity Detection: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous questions based on the uncertainty scores.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of CSE against baseline methods across all metrics. b) Analyze how the number of generated scenarios affects performance. c) Investigate the relationship between scenario diversity and uncertainty estimation quality. d) Perform a qualitative analysis of cases where CSE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Prompting)": "A: The first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911, beating his British rival Robert Falcon Scott by about a month. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSE Step 1: Scenario Generation)": "Given the question \"Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?\", generate 3 different interpretations or scenarios that could lead to different answers. Label them as Scenario 1, Scenario 2, and Scenario 3.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSE Step 1: Scenario Generation)": "Scenario 1: Considering only officially recognized and well-documented expeditions.\nScenario 2: Including potential earlier, undocumented visits by indigenous peoples or early explorers.\nScenario 3: Distinguishing between reaching the geographic South Pole versus the magnetic South Pole.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSE Step 2: Contrastive Analysis for Scenario 1)": "Consider Scenario 1: Considering only officially recognized and well-documented expeditions. Based on this interpretation, answer the original question \"Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?\" and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSE Step 2: Contrastive Analysis for Scenario 1)": "A: Based on officially recognized and well-documented expeditions, the first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911, leading a team of five. This achievement is well-documented and widely accepted in historical records. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSE Step 3: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the following scenario analyses, calculate the final uncertainty score: Scenario 1: Roald Amundsen (Confidence: 0.98), Scenario 2: Unknown indigenous person (Confidence: 0.3), Scenario 3: James Clark Ross for magnetic South Pole (Confidence: 0.85)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSE Step 3: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final uncertainty score: 0.42 (calculated as 1 - (0.71 * 0.72 * 0.65), where 0.71 is the average confidence, 0.72 is (1 - standard deviation of confidences), and 0.65 is (1 - answer diversity score))",
            "explanation": "The CSE method generates diverse scenarios, leading to a more nuanced uncertainty estimate compared to the overconfident baseline. It captures the ambiguity in the question by considering different interpretations, resulting in a more realistic uncertainty score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSE method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can explore several alternatives: 1) Analyze the generated scenarios to understand if they're sufficiently diverse and relevant. If not, we could experiment with different prompting techniques or fine-tune a smaller language model specifically for scenario generation. 2) Investigate whether the issue lies in the contrastive analysis step. We could try more structured prompts or experiment with different confidence elicitation methods. 3) If the uncertainty synthesis step is problematic, we could explore alternative aggregation methods, such as using learned weights for different components of the uncertainty score. 4) We could also pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on why LLMs struggle with uncertainty quantification in different types of scenarios. This could involve creating a taxonomy of uncertainty types and analyzing how different prompting methods perform for each type."
