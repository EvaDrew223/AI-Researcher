    "topic_description": "novel prompting methods that can better quantify uncertainty or calibrate the confidence of large language models",
    "idea_name": "Confidence Spectrum Decomposition",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty across different aspects of a complex query, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in specific areas.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on overall confidence scores or binary uncertainty estimates, lacking granularity in pinpointing specific areas of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing queries into constituent elements and assessing confidence for each, we can obtain a more nuanced understanding of model uncertainty, similar to how humans express varying levels of certainty about different aspects of a topic.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Decomposition (CSD), a multi-stage prompting technique. First, we prompt the model to break down the query into key elements. Then, for each element, we use a series of calibrated prompts to elicit a fine-grained confidence score (e.g., on a scale of 1-10) and a justification. Finally, we aggregate these scores into a visual 'confidence spectrum' and prompt the model to provide an overall assessment based on this spectrum. This method allows for a more precise and interpretable representation of model uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CSD against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and consistency sampling on a range of tasks including open-domain QA, multi-hop reasoning, and fact verification. We'll measure calibration using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and assess the informativeness of the confidence spectrum through human evaluation."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Decomposition: A Multi-Stage Prompting Technique for Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty across different aspects of a complex query, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in specific areas. Current approaches typically focus on overall confidence scores or binary uncertainty estimates, lacking granularity in pinpointing specific areas of uncertainty. This problem is crucial to address as it impacts the reliability and interpretability of model outputs in various applications, from decision support systems to educational tools.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as direct confidence elicitation or consistency sampling, often provide a single, coarse-grained measure of uncertainty. These approaches fail to capture the nuanced levels of certainty that models may have about different aspects of a complex query. By decomposing queries into constituent elements and assessing confidence for each, we can obtain a more nuanced understanding of model uncertainty, similar to how humans express varying levels of certainty about different aspects of a topic. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where individuals can express different levels of confidence for various parts of their knowledge or reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Decomposition (CSD), a multi-stage prompting technique. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Query Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the query into key elements. 2) Confidence Elicitation: For each element, use a series of calibrated prompts to elicit a fine-grained confidence score (e.g., on a scale of 1-10) and a justification. 3) Aggregation and Assessment: Aggregate these scores into a visual 'confidence spectrum' and prompt the model to provide an overall assessment based on this spectrum. This method allows for a more precise and interpretable representation of model uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for open-domain question answering, 2) HotpotQA for multi-hop reasoning, and 3) FEVER for fact verification. These datasets cover a range of tasks that require different levels of reasoning and knowledge, allowing us to test the effectiveness of CSD across various scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for the entire answer. b) Consistency sampling: Generate multiple answers and calculate the consistency among them as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: CSD Implementation": "Implement the three stages of CSD: a) Query Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the query into 3-5 key elements. b) Confidence Elicitation: For each element, prompt the model to provide a confidence score (1-10) and justification. c) Aggregation and Assessment: Create a visual representation of the confidence spectrum and prompt the model for an overall assessment.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run the CSD method. c) Collect model outputs, confidence scores, and justifications.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure calibration. b) Brier Score to assess probabilistic predictions. c) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for classification tasks. d) Human evaluation to assess the informativeness and interpretability of the confidence spectrum.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis comparing CSD with baseline methods: a) Compare calibration and accuracy across methods. b) Analyze the granularity and interpretability of uncertainty estimates. c) Investigate how CSD performs across different types of queries and reasoning tasks."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in what year did this happen?",
                "Direct Confidence Elicitation Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon in 1969. Confidence: 9/10",
                "Consistency Sampling Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon in 1969. (Generated 5 times consistently) Confidence: High",
                "Explanation": "Both baseline methods provide a single confidence score, lacking granularity in uncertainty across different aspects of the question."
            },
            "CSD Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in what year did this happen?",
                "Step 1 - Query Decomposition Output": "Key elements: 1) Identity of the first person on the moon, 2) Year of the moon landing",
                "Step 2 - Confidence Elicitation Output": "1) Identity: Neil Armstrong, Confidence: 10/10, Justification: This is a well-known historical fact that I'm very confident about. 2) Year: 1969, Confidence: 9/10, Justification: I'm quite certain about the year, but there's a small chance I might be off by one year.",
                "Step 3 - Aggregation and Assessment Output": "Confidence Spectrum: [Identity: 10/10] [Year: 9/10] Overall Assessment: I'm highly confident in the overall answer. The identity of Neil Armstrong as the first person on the moon is a fact I'm absolutely certain about. The year 1969 I'm also very confident about, with only a slight possibility of being off by a year.",
                "Explanation": "CSD provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence across different aspects of the question, allowing for a more precise understanding of where potential uncertainties lie."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSD method doesn't significantly improve upon baseline methods, we can pivot our research in several directions. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why CSD fails to improve uncertainty quantification. This could involve categorizing types of queries where CSD performs poorly and analyzing the model's decomposition and confidence elicitation processes. Second, we could explore variations of the CSD method, such as iterative refinement of confidence scores or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the confidence estimates. Third, we could shift focus to analyze how different prompting strategies affect the model's ability to assess its own uncertainty, potentially uncovering insights about the model's metacognitive capabilities. Lastly, we could investigate how CSD performs across different model sizes and architectures, which could provide valuable insights into how model scale and training affect uncertainty quantification abilities."
