        "Title": "Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition: A Novel Prompting Method for Hierarchical Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex, hierarchical tasks where uncertainty can propagate and compound across multiple levels of reasoning. This limitation hinders the reliable use of LLMs in critical applications that require accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on flat, single-level uncertainty estimation or simple aggregation of uncertainties from different steps. These methods fail to capture the intricate, self-similar patterns of uncertainty that emerge in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by fractal geometry, we propose that uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks exhibits self-similar patterns at different scales, which can be leveraged for more accurate and interpretable uncertainty quantification. Our Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition (FUD) method aims to address this gap by providing a more nuanced and hierarchical approach to uncertainty estimation in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition (FUD), a novel prompting technique that recursively breaks down a complex task into smaller sub-tasks, estimates uncertainty at each level, and then aggregates these estimates in a fractal-like manner. The process involves four main steps: 1) Task Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the main task into sub-tasks, creating a tree-like structure. 2) Leaf Node Estimation: For each leaf node (atomic sub-task), prompt the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score. 3) Fractal Aggregation: Moving up the tree, prompt the LLM to combine uncertainties from child nodes, considering potential interactions and compounding effects. 4) Uncertainty Visualization: Generate a fractal-inspired visual representation of the uncertainty structure, providing an intuitive understanding of where uncertainties originate and how they propagate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve complex reasoning: MATH (for mathematical problem-solving), GSM8K (for grade school math word problems), and MultiArith (for multi-step arithmetic reasoning). These datasets will be preprocessed to ensure they are in a consistent format for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement and evaluate three baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Monte Carlo Dropout, 2) Deep Ensembles, and 3) Temperature Scaling. These will serve as comparisons for our FUD method.",
            "Step 3: FUD Implementation": "Implement the FUD method with the following sub-steps: a) Task Decomposition Prompt: 'Break down this problem into smaller sub-problems. For each sub-problem, provide a brief description.' b) Leaf Node Estimation Prompt: 'Solve this sub-problem and provide your answer along with a confidence score between 0 and 1.' c) Fractal Aggregation Prompt: 'Given the solutions and confidence scores of the sub-problems, provide an overall solution and confidence score for the main problem.' d) Implement a recursive algorithm to apply these prompts in a tree-like structure.",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Visualization": "Develop a visualization tool that represents the hierarchical uncertainty structure as a fractal tree, where node size and color intensity correspond to confidence levels.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for both baselines and FUD. We will also test with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess performance across different model sizes.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of FUD against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Brier Score, 3) Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), and 4) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Additionally, conduct a qualitative analysis of the uncertainty visualizations.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of FUD: 1) Remove the fractal aggregation step, 2) Use a fixed depth for task decomposition, 3) Replace LLM-generated confidence scores with a fixed heuristic.",
            "Step 8: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation study with domain experts (e.g., mathematicians for MATH dataset) to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the fractal uncertainty visualizations.",
            "Step 9: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze the results, comparing FUD's performance against baselines across different problem types and complexity levels. Prepare visualizations and statistical analyses to highlight the strengths and limitations of the FUD method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is its volume in cubic centimeters?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The volume of the rectangular prism is 60 cubic centimeters. Confidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FUD Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Q: A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is its volume in cubic centimeters? Break down this problem into smaller sub-problems. For each sub-problem, provide a brief description.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FUD Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "1. Identify the formula: Recall the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism.\n2. Extract dimensions: Identify the length, width, and height from the given information.\n3. Calculate the volume: Apply the formula using the extracted dimensions.\n4. Check units: Ensure the final answer is in cubic centimeters.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FUD Step 2: Leaf Node Estimation)": "Solve this sub-problem and provide your answer along with a confidence score between 0 and 1: Identify the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FUD Step 2: Leaf Node Estimation)": "The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = l * w * h, where V is volume, l is length, w is width, and h is height. Confidence: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FUD Step 3: Fractal Aggregation)": "Given the solutions and confidence scores of the sub-problems: 1. Formula: V = l * w * h (0.99)\n2. Dimensions: l = 5 cm, w = 3 cm, h = 4 cm (1.0)\n3. Calculation: 5 * 3 * 4 = 60 (0.98)\n4. Units: cubic centimeters (1.0)\nProvide an overall solution and confidence score for the main problem.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FUD Step 3: Fractal Aggregation)": "The volume of the rectangular prism is 60 cubic centimeters. Overall confidence: 0.97. This confidence score is derived from the product of individual confidences, slightly adjusted downward to account for potential compounding uncertainties.",
            "Explanation": "The FUD method provides a more detailed and transparent uncertainty estimation by breaking down the problem into sub-tasks and aggregating uncertainties in a hierarchical manner. This allows for better identification of sources of uncertainty and potentially more accurate overall uncertainty estimation compared to the flat confidence score provided by the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed FUD method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of the task decompositions generated by the LLM. If these are suboptimal, we could explore using human-curated task decompositions for comparison. 2) Analyzing the accuracy of leaf node estimations and their confidence scores. If these are unreliable, we could investigate alternative prompting strategies or confidence calibration techniques. 3) Evaluating the effectiveness of the fractal aggregation step. If this step doesn't add value, we could explore alternative aggregation methods, such as weighted averaging or more sophisticated probabilistic approaches. 4) Investigating whether the method's performance varies across different types of problems or levels of complexity. This could lead to insights about when and why FUD is most effective. 5) Comparing the interpretability of FUD's uncertainty estimates with those of baseline methods through user studies. Even if quantitative performance is similar, FUD might offer advantages in terms of explainability and user trust. Based on these analyses, we could refine the FUD method, propose alternative approaches, or pivot the project towards a comprehensive analysis of hierarchical uncertainty estimation in LLMs, which could still provide valuable insights to the field."
