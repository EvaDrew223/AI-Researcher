        "Problem": "Crafting effective prompts for uncertainty quantification is challenging and often relies on human intuition, potentially missing optimal formulations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most uncertainty prompting methods use fixed, manually designed prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Evolutionary algorithms have shown success in optimizing complex, discrete structures. We propose leveraging this approach to automatically discover effective uncertainty prompting strategies.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Evolutionary Prompt Optimization for Uncertainty (EPO-U), a method that uses genetic algorithms to evolve a population of prompts for uncertainty quantification. The process includes: 1) Initialize a population of candidate prompts with diverse structures and phrasings for eliciting uncertainty. 2) Evaluate each prompt's fitness based on the calibration and discriminative power of the resulting uncertainty estimates on a validation set. 3) Apply genetic operators (mutation, crossover) to generate new candidate prompts. 4) Iterate the evolution process, selecting the fittest prompts for each generation. 5) The final evolved prompt is then used for uncertainty quantification on new tasks. This approach can discover novel, non-intuitive prompting strategies that outperform manually designed ones.",

        "Title": "Evolutionary Prompt Optimization for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Crafting effective prompts for uncertainty quantification in large language models is challenging and often relies on human intuition, potentially missing optimal formulations. Current methods typically use fixed, manually designed prompts, which may not fully leverage the model's capabilities for expressing uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Evolutionary algorithms have shown success in optimizing complex, discrete structures. By applying this approach to prompt engineering for uncertainty quantification, we can potentially discover more effective prompting strategies that outperform manually designed ones. This method could lead to better calibrated and more reliable uncertainty estimates from large language models, which is crucial for their safe and trustworthy deployment in real-world applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Evolutionary Prompt Optimization for Uncertainty (EPO-U), a method that uses genetic algorithms to evolve a population of prompts for uncertainty quantification.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use a diverse set of tasks that require uncertainty quantification. We'll use the following datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking, 2) AmbigQA for ambiguous question answering, and 3) MMLU for multi-task language understanding. Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Prompt Design": "Implement several baseline uncertainty prompts: a) Direct prompting: 'What is your confidence in this answer on a scale of 0-100%?', b) Likelihood prompting: 'What is the likelihood that this answer is correct?', c) Ensemble prompting: Use multiple phrasings and average the results.",
            "Step 3: EPO-U Implementation": "Implement the genetic algorithm for prompt evolution: a) Define a grammar for generating valid prompts, including placeholders for the task, question, and answer. b) Initialize a population of 100 random prompts. c) Implement mutation (e.g., word substitution, phrase insertion/deletion) and crossover operations. d) Define a fitness function that combines calibration error (e.g., expected calibration error) and discriminative power (e.g., Brier score).",
            "Step 4: Prompt Evaluation": "For each prompt in the population: a) Apply it to the validation set. b) Use the LLM to generate uncertainty estimates for each example. c) Calculate the fitness score based on calibration and discrimination metrics.",
            "Step 5: Evolution Process": "Run the evolutionary algorithm for 50 generations: a) Select the top 20% of prompts based on fitness. b) Apply crossover and mutation to generate new prompts. c) Replace the bottom 80% of the population with the new prompts. d) Repeat steps 4-5 for each generation.",
            "Step 6: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, use Claude from Anthropic and PaLM from Google as alternative models for robustness checks.",
            "Step 7: Final Evaluation": "Take the best-performing prompt from the evolution process and evaluate it on the test sets of all three datasets. Compare its performance against the baseline prompts and human-designed prompts from recent literature.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the evolved prompts: a) Identify common patterns or phrases that emerge. b) Compare the structure of evolved prompts to baseline and human-designed prompts. c) Evaluate the transferability of evolved prompts across different tasks and models."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? A: Neil Armstrong. How confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "I am 95% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? A: Neil Armstrong. Analyze the certainty of this answer by considering: 1) Your knowledge of space history, 2) Potential alternative answers, 3) The reliability of your information sources. Then, express your uncertainty as a probability distribution over possible answers.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Based on my analysis:\n1) Space history knowledge: The Apollo 11 mission in 1969 is widely recognized as the first moon landing.\n2) Potential alternatives: Buzz Aldrin was the second person on the moon, which could be a source of confusion.\n3) Information reliability: This is a well-documented historical fact with multiple reliable sources.\n\nUncertainty distribution:\nNeil Armstrong: 98%\nBuzz Aldrin: 1.5%\nOther astronauts: 0.5%\n\nI express high confidence in Neil Armstrong being the correct answer, with a small probability allocated to alternatives to account for potential errors in my knowledge or recall.",
            "Explanation": "The evolved prompt encourages a more thorough analysis of the uncertainty, considering multiple factors and expressing the uncertainty as a probability distribution. This provides a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated uncertainty estimate compared to the simple confidence percentage in the baseline prompt."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the evolved prompts do not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of why certain prompt structures perform better or worse, providing insights into effective uncertainty elicitation strategies. 2) Explore hybrid approaches that combine evolutionary optimization with human-designed prompts or rules. 3) Investigate the impact of different fitness functions on the evolved prompts, potentially uncovering trade-offs between calibration and discrimination. 4) Extend the study to compare EPO-U with other automated prompt optimization methods, such as gradient-based approaches or reinforcement learning. This could lead to a comparative analysis of different prompt optimization strategies for uncertainty quantification."
