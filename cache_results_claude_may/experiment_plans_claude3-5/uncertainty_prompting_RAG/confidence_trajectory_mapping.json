    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current confidence estimation methods for large language models often fail to capture how the model's certainty evolves as it processes and generates text, leading to oversimplified final confidence scores.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide a single confidence score at the end of text generation or rely on token-level probabilities without considering higher-level semantic trajectories.",
        "Motivation": "By mapping the trajectory of the model's confidence as it generates text, we can potentially capture richer information about the model's reasoning process and points of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Trajectory Mapping (CTM), a method that tracks and analyzes the model's confidence throughout the text generation process. The approach involves: 1) Modify the prompt to encourage the model to 'think aloud' about its confidence at regular intervals during text generation. For example, after every sentence or key point, the model is prompted to express its current confidence level and reasons for any changes. 2) Implement a special token or format that allows the model to embed these confidence reflections within the generated text without disrupting the main content. 3) Design prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its overall confidence trajectory at the end of generation. For example: \"Reviewing your confidence changes throughout this response, what patterns do you notice? How does this inform your final confidence level?\" 4) Develop an algorithm to extract and analyze the embedded confidence markers, producing a visualization of the confidence trajectory and summary statistics (e.g., confidence volatility, overall trend).",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CTM against standard end-point confidence estimation on tasks requiring extended reasoning or text generation, such as essay writing, code generation, or multi-step problem solving. Develop new metrics to assess the informativeness of confidence trajectories. Conduct user studies to determine whether confidence trajectory information helps humans better understand and trust model outputs. Analyze how different types of tasks produce different characteristic confidence trajectories."

        "Problem Statement": "Current confidence estimation methods for large language models often fail to capture how the model's certainty evolves as it processes and generates text, leading to oversimplified final confidence scores. This limitation hinders our understanding of the model's reasoning process and points of uncertainty throughout text generation.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide a single confidence score at the end of text generation or rely on token-level probabilities without considering higher-level semantic trajectories. By mapping the trajectory of the model's confidence as it generates text, we can potentially capture richer information about the model's reasoning process and points of uncertainty. This approach could lead to more nuanced and informative uncertainty quantification, enabling better interpretation of model outputs and potentially improving the model's performance on tasks requiring extended reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Trajectory Mapping (CTM), a method that tracks and analyzes the model's confidence throughout the text generation process. The approach involves four main steps: 1) Modify the prompt to encourage the model to 'think aloud' about its confidence at regular intervals during text generation. 2) Implement a special token or format that allows the model to embed these confidence reflections within the generated text without disrupting the main content. 3) Design prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its overall confidence trajectory at the end of generation. 4) Develop an algorithm to extract and analyze the embedded confidence markers, producing a visualization of the confidence trajectory and summary statistics.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets for extended reasoning tasks: 1) GSM8K for multi-step math problem solving, 2) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, and 3) WritingPrompts for long-form text generation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation methods as baselines: 1) End-point confidence scoring: use the model's output probability for the final token as the confidence score. 2) Average token probability: calculate the mean probability of all generated tokens as the confidence score.",
            "Step 3: CTM Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each task that incorporate confidence reflection. For example, for math problems: 'Solve this step-by-step. After each step, rate your confidence from 1-10 and briefly explain why. Use the format [CONF:X Reason] for your confidence ratings.' For long-form generation: 'Write a story based on this prompt. After each paragraph, rate your confidence from 1-10 about the quality and coherence of your writing so far. Use the format [CONF:X Reason] for your confidence ratings.'",
            "Step 4: Implement CTM": "Develop a pipeline that: 1) Sends the CTM-augmented prompts to the LLM API. 2) Extracts the confidence ratings and reasons from the generated text using regex patterns. 3) Calculates confidence trajectory metrics (e.g., mean confidence, confidence volatility, trend).",
            "Step 5: Visualization": "Create visualizations of confidence trajectories: 1) Line plots showing confidence over time/steps. 2) Heatmaps highlighting high and low confidence regions in generated text.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Define metrics to assess the informativeness of confidence trajectories: 1) Correlation between trajectory features and task performance. 2) Ability to predict task success based on trajectory features. 3) Comparison of CTM confidence scores with baseline methods in terms of calibration and discriminative power.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Design a small-scale human evaluation study: 1) Present human judges with model outputs and corresponding confidence trajectories. 2) Ask judges to rate the helpfulness of the trajectory information for understanding model reasoning and assessing output quality.",
            "Step 8: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs: 1) Generate outputs and confidence trajectories for all tasks using both baseline and CTM methods. 2) Calculate evaluation metrics. 3) Conduct human evaluation study.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: 1) Compare CTM performance against baselines across different tasks. 2) Identify patterns in confidence trajectories (e.g., common shapes, critical points). 3) Analyze the relationship between confidence trajectories and output quality/correctness. 4) Examine how different types of tasks produce different characteristic confidence trajectories."

                "Output": "Step 1: John starts with 5 apples.\n[CONF:10 This is directly stated in the question]\n\nStep 2: John gives 2 apples to his friend. 5 - 2 = 3 apples remaining.\n[CONF:9 Simple subtraction, but always a slight chance of calculation error]\n\nStep 3: John buys 3 more apples. 3 + 3 = 6 apples total.\n[CONF:9 Another simple addition, but maintaining caution]\n\nFinal answer: John has 6 apples now.\n[CONF:9 Confident in the calculation, but always a small chance of overlooking something]",

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CTM method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing why the confidence trajectories aren't as informative as expected. This could involve: 1) Conducting a detailed error analysis to identify patterns in where CTM fails to capture uncertainty accurately. 2) Experimenting with different prompting strategies to encourage more nuanced confidence reporting. 3) Investigating how confidence trajectories vary across different model sizes or architectures. 4) Exploring the relationship between confidence trajectories and specific types of errors or reasoning failures. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in self-assessing their performance during extended reasoning tasks, potentially informing future research directions in improving model calibration and uncertainty quantification."
