    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide inconsistent answers to the same question when asked multiple times or in different contexts, but fail to recognize this inconsistency as a sign of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches assess uncertainty based on a single query instance, neglecting temporal consistency.",
        "Motivation": "Consistency over time is a key indicator of certainty in human knowledge. We aim to leverage this principle for more accurate uncertainty estimation in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a temporal consistency probing technique. For a given query, we generate multiple prompts that ask the same question but vary the context, phrasing, or temporal framing (e.g., 'What was X in 2020?' vs. 'What is X now?'). The model is then prompted to compare its responses across these temporal variants, identify any inconsistencies, and provide a revised answer along with an uncertainty estimate that accounts for the degree of consistency. Prompts will be designed to encourage the model to critically analyze its own temporal consistency and revise its confidence accordingly.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on a diverse set of queries, including time-sensitive topics and general knowledge questions. Compare its performance to standard single-instance uncertainty estimation techniques, evaluating both the accuracy of the final answers and the reliability of the uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Probing for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inconsistent answers to the same question when asked multiple times or in different contexts, but fail to recognize this inconsistency as a sign of uncertainty. This leads to overconfident predictions and unreliable uncertainty estimates, which can be problematic in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically focus on single-instance assessments, neglecting the importance of temporal consistency. In human cognition, consistency over time is a key indicator of certainty in knowledge. By leveraging this principle, we aim to develop a more accurate and robust method for uncertainty estimation in LLMs. Our approach is inspired by the human cognitive process of cross-referencing information across different temporal contexts to gauge confidence in knowledge.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a temporal consistency probing technique that involves the following steps: 1) Generate multiple prompts for a given query that vary the context, phrasing, or temporal framing. 2) Obtain responses from the LLM for each variant. 3) Prompt the LLM to compare its responses across these temporal variants, identify inconsistencies, and provide a revised answer. 4) Ask the LLM to provide an uncertainty estimate that accounts for the degree of consistency observed across responses. This method encourages the model to critically analyze its own temporal consistency and revise its confidence accordingly.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, TimeQA, and general knowledge questions from datasets like Natural Questions. Ensure a mix of time-sensitive topics and general knowledge questions.",
            "Step 2: Prompt Generation": "For each question, create multiple prompt variants that alter the temporal framing or context. For example: 'What was X in 2020?', 'What is X now?', 'In the context of Y, what is X?'",
            "Step 3: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. These models will be used for both generating initial responses and performing the consistency analysis.",
            "Step 4: Response Generation": "For each question and its prompt variants, generate responses using the selected models.",
            "Step 5: Consistency Analysis Prompt": "Design a prompt that instructs the model to compare its responses across the temporal variants, identify inconsistencies, and provide a revised answer. Example: 'You've been asked about X in different contexts. Here are your responses: [list responses]. Analyze these for consistency, identify any contradictions, and provide a final answer along with your confidence level.'",
            "Step 6: Uncertainty Estimation Prompt": "Design a prompt that asks the model to quantify its uncertainty based on the consistency analysis. Example: 'Based on your consistency analysis, provide an uncertainty estimate on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely certain and 100 is completely uncertain. Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 7: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard single-instance uncertainty estimation techniques for comparison. This could include temperature scaling, Monte Carlo dropout (if applicable to the API), and ensemble methods using different model versions.",
            "Step 8: Data Collection": "Run the experiment, collecting the following for each question: initial responses for each prompt variant, consistency analysis, revised answer, and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 9: Evaluation Metrics": "Define metrics for evaluation, including: accuracy of final answers, calibration of uncertainty estimates (using tools like expected calibration error), consistency score (measuring agreement across temporal variants), and correlation between uncertainty estimates and actual error rates.",
            "Step 10: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the temporal consistency probing method against the baselines. Analyze how well the method captures uncertainty in time-sensitive vs. general knowledge questions. Investigate cases where the method significantly improves or fails to improve uncertainty estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Question": "Who is the current President of the United States?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Who is the current President of the United States?",
                "Baseline Output": "The current President of the United States is Joe Biden. (Confidence: 95%)",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence answer without considering potential temporal inconsistencies or the model's knowledge cutoff date."
            },
            "Example 2 (Proposed Method Success)": {
                "Question": "Who is the current President of the United States?",
                "Temporal Variant Prompts": [
                    "Who was the President of the United States in 2020?",
                    "Who is the current President of the United States as of today?",
                    "In the context of recent elections, who holds the office of US President?"
                ],
                "Model Responses": [
                    "In 2020, Donald Trump was the President of the United States.",
                    "As of today, Joe Biden is the current President of the United States.",
                    "Following the most recent election I'm certain about, Joe Biden became the President of the United States."
                ],
                "Consistency Analysis Prompt": "You've been asked about the US President in different contexts. Here are your responses: [list responses]. Analyze these for consistency, identify any contradictions, and provide a final answer along with your confidence level.",
                "Consistency Analysis Output": "There is some inconsistency in my responses. While I correctly identified Donald Trump as President in 2020, my knowledge about the current President may not be up-to-date. Based on the most recent information I'm certain about, Joe Biden is the President. However, I'm not sure if there have been any changes since then.",
                "Uncertainty Estimation Prompt": "Based on your consistency analysis, provide an uncertainty estimate on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely certain and 100 is completely uncertain. Explain your reasoning.",
                "Final Output": "The current President of the United States, based on my most recent reliable information, is Joe Biden. However, due to potential gaps in my knowledge of recent events, I assign an uncertainty estimate of 40 on a scale of 0-100. This moderate level of uncertainty reflects my confidence in the information I have, balanced against the possibility of recent changes I might not be aware of.",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method successfully identifies temporal inconsistencies, leading to a more nuanced and appropriately uncertain response. It acknowledges the potential for outdated information and provides a more calibrated uncertainty estimate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed temporal consistency probing method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty estimation, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of where and why the method fails, potentially uncovering insights about how LLMs handle temporal information and consistency. This could involve categorizing types of questions where the method performs poorly and examining patterns in the model's responses. Second, we could explore variations of the method, such as incorporating external knowledge sources to verify temporal claims, or developing a meta-model that learns to predict when temporal consistency probing is likely to be beneficial. Finally, we could shift focus to using the temporal consistency data to improve other aspects of LLM performance, such as developing prompting strategies that enhance temporal reasoning abilities or creating datasets for fine-tuning models on temporal consistency tasks."
