        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to false confidence in areas where they lack reliable information.",

        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Probing (CCP), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Given an initial query, generate a set of counterfactual variations that systematically alter key aspects of the query. 2) Prompt the model to answer both the original query and counterfactuals, along with confidence estimates. 3) Analyze the pattern of confidence changes across counterfactuals to identify knowledge boundaries and potential areas of false confidence. 4) Generate a final calibrated confidence score and explanation based on this counterfactual analysis.",

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Probing: Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Systematic Knowledge Boundary Exploration",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to false confidence in areas where they lack reliable information. This overconfidence can result in the propagation of misinformation and unreliable decision-making in critical applications. Existing confidence estimation methods typically rely on direct elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs, which can be fooled by spurious correlations or memorized patterns. There is a pressing need for more robust and insightful methods to quantify uncertainty and calibrate confidence in LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs often fail to capture the nuanced boundaries of model knowledge. Direct confidence elicitation can be biased by the model's inherent tendencies, while statistical methods may not account for the complex reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. By systematically probing the model's knowledge boundaries through counterfactual scenarios, we can gain deeper insights into true areas of uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to explore the limits of its knowledge, potentially leading to more accurate and interpretable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Probing (CCP), a multi-step prompting technique designed to explore and quantify the boundaries of an LLM's knowledge. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Given an initial query, generate a set of counterfactual variations that systematically alter key aspects of the query. 2) Prompt the model to answer both the original query and counterfactuals, along with confidence estimates. 3) Analyze the pattern of confidence changes across counterfactuals to identify knowledge boundaries and potential areas of false confidence. 4) Generate a final calibrated confidence score and explanation based on this counterfactual analysis.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 3) a custom dataset of temporal reasoning questions. For each dataset, we will select a subset of 1000 questions to form our test set.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline confidence estimation methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append \"How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?\" to each query. 2) Softmax probability: Use the softmax probability of the top token as a confidence measure. 3) Ensemble disagreement: Use the disagreement among multiple forward passes with different random seeds as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: CCP Implementation": "Implement the Counterfactual Confidence Probing method: a) Counterfactual Generation: For each query, generate 5 counterfactual variations using a separate LLM instance. Example prompt: \"Generate 5 variations of the following question that change key details while maintaining the overall structure: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION]\". b) Confidence Elicitation: For the original query and each counterfactual, prompt the model to answer and provide a confidence estimate. Example prompt: \"Question: [QUESTION] Answer the question and rate your confidence on a scale of 0-100.\". c) Confidence Pattern Analysis: Implement an algorithm to analyze the pattern of confidence changes across counterfactuals. This could involve calculating the variance in confidence scores, identifying sharp drops in confidence, or using a separate LLM instance to analyze the pattern. d) Calibrated Confidence Generation: Based on the confidence pattern analysis, generate a final calibrated confidence score and explanation. Example prompt: \"Given the following confidence pattern across counterfactuals: [CONFIDENCE_PATTERN], generate a calibrated confidence score (0-100) and explain your reasoning.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will evaluate our method using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from the OpenAI API. For the ensemble baseline and counterfactual generation, we will use separate instances of these models.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method (baselines and CCP), we will: a) Calculate calibration error using Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). b) Compute the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for identifying correct vs. incorrect answers based on confidence scores. c) Qualitatively analyze a sample of 100 examples to assess the quality and interpretability of the confidence estimates and explanations.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct an in-depth analysis of the results: a) Compare the performance of CCP against baselines across different datasets and question types. b) Analyze how CCP performs on questions near the boundaries of the model's knowledge vs. questions well within or outside its knowledge. c) Examine the generated counterfactuals and confidence patterns to gain insights into the model's reasoning process. d) Investigate cases where CCP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the 16th President of the United States? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The 16th President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 1: Counterfactual Generation)": "Generate 5 variations of the following question that change key details while maintaining the overall structure: Who was the 16th President of the United States?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 1: Counterfactual Generation)": "1. Who was the 15th President of the United States?\n2. Who was the 16th Prime Minister of Canada?\n3. Who was the 16th President of France?\n4. Who was the 16th Emperor of China?\n5. Who was the 16th President of the United States in an alternate timeline where the American Revolution failed?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 2: Confidence Elicitation)": "Question: Who was the 16th President of the United States? Answer the question and rate your confidence on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 2: Confidence Elicitation)": "Answer: The 16th President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 3: Confidence Pattern Analysis)": "Analyze the following confidence pattern across counterfactuals:\nOriginal: Who was the 16th President of the United States? Confidence: 100\n1. Who was the 15th President of the United States? Confidence: 95\n2. Who was the 16th Prime Minister of Canada? Confidence: 60\n3. Who was the 16th President of France? Confidence: 40\n4. Who was the 16th Emperor of China? Confidence: 30\n5. Who was the 16th President of the United States in an alternate timeline where the American Revolution failed? Confidence: 10",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 3: Confidence Pattern Analysis)": "The confidence pattern shows high confidence (95-100) for questions about U.S. Presidents, moderate confidence (60) for other North American political figures, and low confidence (10-40) for questions about other countries or alternate timelines. This suggests strong knowledge about U.S. Presidential history, some knowledge about North American politics, and limited knowledge about other countries' political history or hypothetical scenarios.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 4: Calibrated Confidence Generation)": "Given the following confidence pattern across counterfactuals: [CONFIDENCE_PATTERN], generate a calibrated confidence score (0-100) for the original question 'Who was the 16th President of the United States?' and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 4: Calibrated Confidence Generation)": "Calibrated Confidence Score: 98\n\nExplanation: The model shows very high confidence (100) for the original question about the 16th U.S. President, and this confidence remains high (95) even when slightly altering the question to the 15th President. This suggests strong, stable knowledge about U.S. Presidential history. However, the sharp drops in confidence for questions about other countries and hypothetical scenarios indicate that the model's knowledge is specific to actual U.S. history rather than a general ability to generate plausible answers about political figures. The slight reduction from 100 to 98 accounts for the small possibility of confusion with very closely related facts (e.g., potentially mixing up the 15th and 16th Presidents), but overall, the model's confidence in this specific piece of U.S. historical knowledge appears to be well-founded.",
            "explanation": "The CCP method provides a more nuanced and interpretable confidence estimate compared to direct elicitation. By exploring counterfactuals, it reveals the boundaries of the model's knowledge (U.S. history vs. other countries) and potential areas of confusion (nearby Presidents). This allows for a more calibrated final confidence score that accounts for these factors, potentially reducing overconfidence in edge cases."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCP method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand what types of variations are most informative for uncertainty estimation. This could lead to insights on how LLMs represent and reason about their own knowledge boundaries. 2) Investigate whether the confidence patterns across counterfactuals can be used as features for a machine learning model to predict answer correctness or calibrate confidence, potentially outperforming both baselines and the direct CCP method. 3) Explore how the CCP method performs across different types of questions (e.g., factual recall vs. reasoning) and model sizes. This could lead to insights about how model scale affects knowledge boundaries and confidence calibration. 4) Analyze cases where CCP performs poorly to identify potential failure modes and propose targeted improvements to the method."
