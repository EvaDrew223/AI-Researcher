        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple knowledge domains intersect.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like ensemble methods or dropout-based uncertainty estimation often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in cross-domain reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by resonance phenomena in physics, we hypothesize that prompting an LLM to approach a problem from multiple angles and measuring the 'resonance' or consistency between these approaches could yield a more accurate uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Resonance Mapping (CRM), a multi-step prompting technique. First, we decompose the original query into sub-queries spanning different knowledge domains. We then prompt the LLM to answer these sub-queries and the original query independently. Next, we instruct the LLM to compare the consistency between the sub-query answers and the main answer, generating a 'resonance score'. Finally, we prompt the LLM to synthesize these scores into a final confidence estimate. This method allows for a more nuanced uncertainty quantification by examining how different aspects of the model's knowledge interact and align.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CRM against standard uncertainty estimation techniques on cross-domain reasoning tasks from datasets like MultiArith and MMLU. We'll measure performance using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score, as well as qualitative analysis of the generated reasoning paths."

        "Title": "Confidence Resonance Mapping: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Domain Reasoning",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple knowledge domains intersect. This issue is particularly pronounced when models are required to integrate information from diverse fields to solve a problem, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones. Accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for the responsible deployment of LLMs in high-stakes decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs, such as ensemble methods or dropout-based techniques, often fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties that arise in cross-domain reasoning tasks. These methods typically treat uncertainty as a uniform property across the model's output, neglecting the varying levels of confidence the model might have in different aspects of its reasoning. Inspired by resonance phenomena in physics, where systems respond more strongly to stimuli that match their natural frequencies, we hypothesize that probing an LLM's knowledge from multiple angles and measuring the consistency between these approaches could yield a more accurate uncertainty estimate. This method allows us to leverage the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to assess its confidence, potentially providing a more nuanced and accurate measure of uncertainty without requiring extensive model modifications or external data.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Resonance Mapping (CRM), a multi-step prompting technique designed to quantify uncertainty in LLMs' responses to complex, cross-domain questions. The process involves the following steps:\n1. Query Decomposition: Break down the original query into sub-queries spanning different knowledge domains relevant to the question.\n2. Multi-Angle Probing: Prompt the LLM to answer these sub-queries and the original query independently.\n3. Consistency Analysis: Instruct the LLM to compare the consistency between the sub-query answers and the main answer, generating a 'resonance score' for each sub-query.\n4. Confidence Synthesis: Prompt the LLM to synthesize these scores into a final confidence estimate, taking into account the relative importance of each sub-query to the overall question.\n5. Calibration: Use a small set of known-answer questions to calibrate the confidence estimates produced by the model.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that feature cross-domain reasoning tasks. We will use:\n- MultiArith: A dataset of multi-step arithmetic word problems.\n- MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): Specifically, we'll focus on subsets that require integration of knowledge from multiple domains, such as 'Professional Medicine' and 'High School Biology'.\n- TruthfulQA: To test the model's ability to distinguish truth from falsehoods across various domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation techniques as baselines:\n- Direct prompting with confidence request\n- Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models)\n- Ensemble method (using different seeds or model versions)\nFor each baseline, we'll use the following prompt template:\n'Question: {question}\nAnswer this question and provide a confidence score between 0 and 100, where 0 means completely uncertain and 100 means absolutely certain.\nAnswer:'",
            "Step 3: CRM Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Resonance Mapping method:\na) Query Decomposition: For each question in the dataset, create a prompt that asks the LLM to break down the question into sub-queries. Example prompt:\n'Question: {question}\nBreak this question down into 3-5 sub-questions that span different knowledge domains relevant to answering the main question. List each sub-question on a new line.\nSub-questions:'\nb) Multi-Angle Probing: For each sub-question and the main question, create a separate prompt to get the LLM's answer. Example prompt:\n'Question: {sub_question}\nProvide a concise answer to this question.\nAnswer:'\nc) Consistency Analysis: Create a prompt that asks the LLM to compare the sub-question answers with the main answer and generate a resonance score. Example prompt:\n'Main Question: {main_question}\nMain Answer: {main_answer}\nSub-question: {sub_question}\nSub-answer: {sub_answer}\nOn a scale of 0 to 100, how consistent is the sub-answer with the main answer? Provide a brief explanation for your score.\nConsistency Score: '\nd) Confidence Synthesis: Create a prompt that asks the LLM to synthesize the resonance scores into a final confidence estimate. Example prompt:\n'Main Question: {main_question}\nMain Answer: {main_answer}\nSub-questions and consistency scores:\n{list_of_sub_questions_and_scores}\nBased on these consistency scores, provide an overall confidence score between 0 and 100 for the main answer. Explain your reasoning.\nOverall Confidence Score: '\ne) Calibration: Use a small set of known-answer questions to calibrate the confidence estimates. Adjust the confidence scores based on the model's performance on these questions.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use the following models for our experiments:\n- GPT-4\n- GPT-3.5-turbo\n- Claude 2\nAll accessed through their respective APIs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CRM against the baselines using the following metrics:\n1. Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy.\n2. Brier Score: Assesses the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n3. Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): Evaluates the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds.\n4. Qualitative Analysis: Manually review a subset of examples to assess the quality and interpretability of the confidence estimates and explanations provided by CRM.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct the following analyses:\n1. Compare CRM performance against baselines across different question types and difficulty levels.\n2. Analyze how the number and diversity of sub-questions affect the accuracy of confidence estimates.\n3. Investigate cases where CRM significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\n4. Examine the relationship between sub-query consistency scores and overall confidence estimates.\n5. Assess the impact of the calibration step on the final confidence estimates."

            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Question: In a clinical trial for a new antibiotic, 150 patients with bacterial infections were treated. The antibiotic was effective in 80% of cases. How many patients did not respond to the treatment?\nAnswer this question and provide a confidence score between 0 and 100, where 0 means completely uncertain and 100 means absolutely certain.\nAnswer:",
                "Expected Output": "To find the number of patients who did not respond to the treatment, we need to calculate 20% of 150 (since 80% responded, 20% did not).\n20% of 150 = 0.2 * 150 = 30\nTherefore, 30 patients did not respond to the treatment.\nConfidence score: 95\nI'm highly confident in this answer because it involves straightforward percentage calculation, which is a basic mathematical operation. The question provides all the necessary information, and there are no ambiguous terms or complex medical concepts involved.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a direct answer with a high confidence score. However, it doesn't break down the problem into its constituent parts or consider potential sources of uncertainty."

How do you calculate the percentage of a total number?\n4. What does it mean for a patient to 'not respond' to a treatment in a clinical context?\n5. How do you convert a percentage to a number of individuals in a group?"

                "Step 2: Multi-Angle Probing": {
                    "Input": "Question: How do you convert a percentage to a number of individuals in a group?\nProvide a concise answer to this question.\nAnswer:",
                    "Expected Output": "To convert a percentage to a number of individuals in a group, multiply the total number in the group by the percentage expressed as a decimal. For example, to find 20% of 150 people, calculate 150 * 0.20 = 30 people."

                "Step 3: Consistency Analysis": {
                    "Input": "Main Question: In a clinical trial for a new antibiotic, 150 patients with bacterial infections were treated. The antibiotic was effective in 80% of cases. How many patients did not respond to the treatment?\nMain Answer: 30 patients did not respond to the treatment.\nSub-question: How do you convert a percentage to a number of individuals in a group?\nSub-answer: To convert a percentage to a number of individuals in a group, multiply the total number in the group by the percentage expressed as a decimal.

Provide a brief explanation for your score.\nConsistency Score:",
                    "Expected Output": "Consistency Score: 100\nExplanation: The sub-answer is perfectly consistent with the main answer. It provides the exact method used to calculate the number of patients who did not respond to the treatment (20% of 150), and even uses the same numbers as in the main question. The sub-answer directly supports and explains the reasoning behind the main answer of 30 patients."
                },
                "Step 4: Confidence Synthesis": {
                    "Input": "Main Question: In a clinical trial for a new antibiotic, 150 patients with bacterial infections were treated. The antibiotic was effective in 80% of cases.

                    "Expected Output": "Overall Confidence Score: 96\nReasoning: The high consistency scores across all sub-questions indicate strong alignment between the main answer and the knowledge required to solve the problem. The perfect scores (100) for the total number of patients, the percentage of positive responses, and the method of converting percentages to numbers directly support the calculation in the main answer. The slightly lower score (95) for calculating percentages is still very high and doesn't significantly impact the overall confidence. The lowest score (85) relates to the clinical interpretation of 'not responding' to treatment, which, while important for context, doesn't directly affect the numerical calculation. Given that the mathematical aspects all show perfect consistency and only the clinical interpretation shows a slight decrease in confidence, an overall score of 96 reflects high confidence in the answer while acknowledging the small potential for misinterpretation in the clinical context."
                },
                "Explanation": "The CRM method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the model's confidence. By breaking down the question into sub-components, probing each separately, and then synthesizing the results, it captures uncertainties that might be missed by simpler methods. The final confidence score is well-justified and takes into account both the mathematical certainty and the slight uncertainty in clinical interpretation."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Confidence Resonance Mapping (CRM) method does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several directions. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the sub-query generation process to understand if the decomposition is effectively capturing the multi-domain nature of the problems. This could lead to insights on how LLMs conceptualize complex questions and potentially inform improved prompting strategies. Second, we could investigate the relationship between sub-query consistency scores and final answer accuracy, which might reveal patterns in how LLMs integrate information across domains. This analysis could be valuable for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in multi-domain reasoning tasks. Third, we could explore variations of the CRM method, such as iterative refinement of sub-queries based on initial consistency scores, or incorporating external knowledge sources to validate sub-query answers. These variations could provide insights into how to more effectively leverage the LLM's capabilities for uncertainty quantification. Lastly, if the method shows promise in some areas but not others, we could focus on developing a hybrid approach that combines CRM with traditional uncertainty estimation techniques, potentially leading to a more robust and generalizable method for quantifying uncertainty in LLMs."
