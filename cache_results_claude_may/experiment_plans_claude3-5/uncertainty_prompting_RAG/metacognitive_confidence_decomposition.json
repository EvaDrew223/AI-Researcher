        "Problem": "Current confidence estimation methods often produce a single score, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall confidence without breaking down contributing factors.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often assess their confidence by considering multiple aspects of their reasoning process. Emulating this metacognitive decomposition could lead to more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Confidence Decomposition (MCD), a prompting technique that guides the model to break down its confidence assessment into distinct cognitive components. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Provide an initial response. 2) Identify key cognitive processes involved in generating the response (e.g., fact retrieval, logical inference, analogical reasoning). 3) For each cognitive process, rate confidence on a scale of 0-100 and provide a brief explanation. 4) Assess the relative importance of each process for the overall response. 5) Synthesize these component scores into an overall confidence estimate, explaining the integration process. 6) Identify which cognitive components, if improved, would most significantly boost overall confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MCD with standard confidence elicitation on a range of tasks requiring diverse cognitive skills (e.g., mathematical problem-solving, reading comprehension, creative writing). Evaluate the correlation between component confidence scores and task-specific performance metrics. Assess the interpretability and actionability of the decomposed confidence profiles through expert analysis."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Confidence Decomposition: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current confidence estimation methods for large language models often produce a single score, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. This oversimplification can lead to unreliable or misleading confidence assessments, particularly in high-stakes applications where nuanced understanding of model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall confidence without breaking down contributing factors. Human experts, in contrast, often assess their confidence by considering multiple aspects of their reasoning process. Emulating this metacognitive decomposition could lead to more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification in LLMs. By breaking down confidence into distinct cognitive components, we can potentially identify specific areas of uncertainty, leading to more actionable insights and targeted improvements in model performance.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Confidence Decomposition (MCD), a prompting technique that guides the model to break down its confidence assessment into distinct cognitive components. The process involves the following steps: 1) Provide an initial response to the given task. 2) Identify key cognitive processes involved in generating the response (e.g., fact retrieval, logical inference, analogical reasoning). 3) For each cognitive process, rate confidence on a scale of 0-100 and provide a brief explanation. 4) Assess the relative importance of each process for the overall response. 5) Synthesize these component scores into an overall confidence estimate, explaining the integration process. 6) Identify which cognitive components, if improved, would most significantly boost overall confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse range of tasks requiring various cognitive skills. We will use: a) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving, b) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension, c) CommonGen for creative writing, and d) TruthfulQA for fact-checking and reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence elicitation methods as baselines: a) Direct confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each prompt. b) Calibrated probabilities: Use softmax output probabilities for multiple-choice questions.",
            "Step 3: MCD Prompt Construction": "Develop a structured prompt for MCD. Example:\n'Given the task: [TASK]\n1. Provide your initial answer.\n2. Identify 3-5 key cognitive processes involved in generating your answer.\n3. For each process, rate your confidence (0-100) and briefly explain.\n4. Assess the relative importance of each process (in percentages, summing to 100%).\n5. Synthesize an overall confidence score and explain how you integrated the components.\n6. Identify which cognitive components, if improved, would most boost your overall confidence.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Also include open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each task in the datasets:\na) Generate responses and confidence estimates using baseline methods.\nb) Generate responses and decomposed confidence estimates using MCD.\nc) Store all outputs, including intermediate steps for MCD.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics:\na) Calibration error: Compare model confidence to actual performance.\nb) Spearman's rank correlation: Between confidence scores and task-specific performance metrics.\nc) Interpretability score: Have human experts rate the interpretability of MCD outputs vs. baselines on a subset of examples.\nd) Actionability score: Rate how well MCD identifies areas for improvement compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare MCD performance against baselines across all metrics.\nb) Analyze the consistency of identified cognitive processes across similar tasks.\nc) Investigate how different cognitive components contribute to overall confidence.\nd) Examine cases where MCD significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "a) Vary the number of cognitive processes identified (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7).\nb) Remove different steps of the MCD process to assess their individual impact.\nc) Experiment with different scales for confidence rating (e.g., 1-5, 1-10).",
            "Step 9: Generalization Tests": "Apply MCD to out-of-distribution tasks not seen during initial experiments to assess generalization capability."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: If a rectangle has a length of 10 cm and a width of 6 cm, what is its area? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The area of the rectangle is 60 square centimeters. To calculate this, I multiplied the length (10 cm) by the width (6 cm): 10 cm \u00d7 6 cm = 60 sq cm. I am 100% confident in this answer as it involves a simple multiplication of two given numbers.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: If a rectangle has a length of 10 cm and a width of 6 cm, what is its area? Please use the Metacognitive Confidence Decomposition method to answer and assess your confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Initial answer: The area of the rectangle is 60 square centimeters.\n\n2. Key cognitive processes involved:\na) Fact retrieval: Recalling the formula for rectangle area\nb) Numerical comprehension: Understanding the given dimensions\nc) Arithmetic calculation: Multiplying length by width\n\n3. Confidence ratings and explanations:\na) Fact retrieval: 100/100 - The formula for rectangle area (length \u00d7 width) is a fundamental geometric concept I'm certain about.\nb) Numerical comprehension: 100/100 - The dimensions are clearly stated in simple, whole numbers.\nc) Arithmetic calculation: 95/100 - While the multiplication is straightforward, there's a slight chance of a calculation error.\n\n4. Relative importance:\na) Fact retrieval: 40%\nb) Numerical comprehension: 20%\nc) Arithmetic calculation: 40%\n\n5. Overall confidence synthesis: 98/100\nExplanation: The overall confidence is very high due to the simplicity of the problem and the certainty in recalling the correct formula. The slight reduction from 100 is due to the small possibility of a calculation error, despite the simplicity of the arithmetic involved.\n\n6. Areas for improvement: Improving the arithmetic calculation component to 100% confidence would boost the overall confidence to 100. This could be achieved by double-checking the calculation or using a calculator for verification.",
            "Explanation": "The MCD method provides a more detailed and nuanced assessment of the model's confidence. It breaks down the reasoning process into specific cognitive components, allowing for a more granular understanding of where potential uncertainties lie. This approach also offers insights into which aspects of the problem-solving process could be improved to increase overall confidence, which is not available in the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MCD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration or correlation with task performance, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of the decomposed confidence components to identify patterns in model reasoning across different task types. This could provide valuable insights into the model's cognitive processes, even if it doesn't improve overall confidence estimation. 2) Investigate whether certain types of tasks or reasoning steps consistently lead to over- or under-confidence, which could inform targeted improvements in model training or prompt engineering. 3) Explore how the MCD outputs could be used to generate more informative explanations of model reasoning, potentially improving model interpretability even if confidence estimation isn't improved. 4) Analyze cases where MCD performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines, which could lead to insights about when decomposed confidence is most useful. 5) Investigate whether the MCD process itself improves task performance, even if it doesn't improve confidence estimation, by encouraging more thorough reasoning. This could shift the focus of the project from confidence estimation to improving reasoning capabilities through metacognitive prompting."
