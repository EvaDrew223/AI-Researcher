        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, often providing overconfident responses even when faced with ambiguous or unfamiliar scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on direct confidence scoring or ensemble methods, which may not capture the nuanced levels of uncertainty across different aspects of a response.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the human process of introspection and iterative refinement of beliefs, we propose a method that allows the model to recursively examine and refine its own uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Crystallization (RUC), a multi-step prompting technique. First, the model generates an initial response and uncertainty estimate. Then, it is prompted to identify specific aspects of its response that contribute to uncertainty. For each aspect, the model generates sub-estimates of uncertainty. This process is repeated recursively, creating a tree-like structure of uncertainty estimates. Finally, these granular estimates are aggregated using a novel uncertainty propagation algorithm, resulting in a more nuanced and accurate overall uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate RUC against baseline methods such as direct confidence scoring and ensemble techniques on a range of tasks including open-ended question answering, fact verification, and commonsense reasoning. We will use metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and a novel metric we term 'uncertainty resolution' to assess the granularity and accuracy of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Recursive Uncertainty Crystallization: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, frequently providing overconfident responses even when faced with ambiguous or unfamiliar scenarios. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, highlighting the need for more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimation techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence scoring or ensemble methods, which may not capture the nuanced levels of uncertainty across different aspects of a response. These methods often fail to account for the complex, multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in language tasks. Our proposed method, Recursive Uncertainty Crystallization (RUC), is inspired by the human process of introspection and iterative refinement of beliefs. By allowing the model to recursively examine and refine its own uncertainty estimates, we aim to produce more granular and accurate uncertainty quantifications that better reflect the model's true confidence levels across various aspects of its responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "Recursive Uncertainty Crystallization (RUC) is a multi-step prompting technique designed to improve uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The process involves the following steps: 1) Initial Response and Uncertainty Estimate: The model generates an initial response to a given query along with an overall uncertainty estimate. 2) Aspect Identification: The model is prompted to identify specific aspects of its response that contribute to uncertainty. 3) Sub-estimate Generation: For each identified aspect, the model generates sub-estimates of uncertainty. 4) Recursive Refinement: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated recursively for each sub-aspect, creating a tree-like structure of uncertainty estimates. 5) Uncertainty Aggregation: The granular estimates are aggregated using a novel uncertainty propagation algorithm, resulting in a more nuanced and accurate overall uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, 2) FEVER for fact verification, and 3) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning. These datasets cover a range of tasks that require different levels of certainty and allow for nuanced uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence scoring: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score along with its answer. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to generate an ensemble of answers and derive uncertainty from the variance in responses.",
            "Step 3: RUC Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Uncertainty Crystallization method: a) Initial response generation with overall uncertainty estimate. b) Aspect identification for uncertainty sources. c) Sub-estimate generation for each aspect. d) Recursive refinement of sub-aspects. e) Uncertainty aggregation using a propagation algorithm.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design effective prompts for each step of the RUC process. For example: 'Identify the main aspects of your response that contribute to uncertainty' for aspect identification, and 'Provide a confidence score (0-100) for this specific aspect' for sub-estimate generation.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Uncertainty resolution: A novel metric to measure the granularity and accuracy of uncertainty estimates across different aspects of the response.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and RUC. For each dataset, process at least 1000 examples to ensure statistical significance.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of RUC against baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the uncertainty tree structures generated by RUC to identify patterns in how the model decomposes and refines its uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of RUC, such as varying the depth of recursion or modifying the uncertainty aggregation algorithm.",
            "Step 10: Results Compilation": "Compile all results, including quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis of uncertainty decomposition patterns. Prepare visualizations of uncertainty trees for representative examples."

            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUC Step 3: Sub-estimate Generation)": "For each identified aspect, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100, where 0 is completely certain and 100 is completely uncertain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUC Step 3: Sub-estimate Generation)": "1. Historical accuracy: 15 (slight uncertainty about ancient history)\n2. Current political status: 2 (very certain about current status)\n3. Definition of 'capital': 10 (small uncertainty about different definitions)",

            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUC Step 5: Final Aggregation)": "Based on all the uncertainty estimates provided, give a final, refined uncertainty score from 0 to 100 for the original question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUC Step 5: Final Aggregation)": "Final refined uncertainty score: 8\nExplanation: While there is high certainty about Paris being the current capital, the small uncertainties about historical changes and definitions slightly increase the overall uncertainty.",
            "explanation": "RUC provides a more nuanced and detailed uncertainty quantification compared to baseline methods. It breaks down the sources of uncertainty and allows for recursive refinement, resulting in a more accurate final uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RUC method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the uncertainty trees generated by RUC to identify patterns in how the model decomposes uncertainty. We could investigate whether certain types of questions or domains lead to more effective uncertainty decomposition. Additionally, we might explore alternative aggregation methods for combining sub-aspect uncertainties, such as weighted averaging based on the perceived importance of each aspect. Another direction could be to analyze cases where RUC performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the recursive approach. This analysis could lead to insights about the nature of uncertainty in language models and inform the development of improved uncertainty quantification methods. If RUC proves ineffective, we could pivot to exploring hybrid approaches that combine direct confidence scoring with aspect-based decomposition, potentially leading to a new method that captures the strengths of both approaches."
