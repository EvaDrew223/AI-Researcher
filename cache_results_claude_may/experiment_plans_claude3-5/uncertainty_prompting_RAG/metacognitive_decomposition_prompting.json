        "Problem": "LLMs often provide poorly calibrated confidence estimates, especially for complex tasks requiring multiple steps of reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on overall task confidence, missing the nuanced uncertainties that may arise at different stages of problem-solving.",

        "Title": "Multi-Stage Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide poorly calibrated confidence estimates, especially for complex tasks requiring multiple steps of reasoning. This issue is particularly pronounced in multi-step reasoning tasks, where uncertainties can compound and propagate through the problem-solving process.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on overall task confidence, missing the nuanced uncertainties that may arise at different stages of problem-solving. Inspired by metacognitive strategies in human learning, we can improve uncertainty quantification by encouraging the model to break down complex tasks and assess confidence at each step. This approach allows for a more granular understanding of where uncertainties arise and how they propagate through the reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-stage prompting strategy: (1) Task decomposition: Prompt the model to break the main task into subtasks. (2) Subtask confidence: For each subtask, elicit a confidence estimate and justification. (3) Dependency mapping: Prompt the model to identify dependencies between subtasks. (4) Uncertainty propagation: Guide the model to reason about how uncertainties in earlier subtasks affect later ones. (5) Holistic reassessment: Prompt for an overall confidence estimate, taking into account the decomposition and propagation. This approach encourages more thorough consideration of potential sources of uncertainty and how they compound throughout the reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use two datasets: (1) GSM8K for multi-step math word problems, and (2) StrategyQA for multi-hop reasoning questions. These datasets are suitable as they require multi-step reasoning and allow for natural task decomposition.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baselines: (1) Direct prompting: Ask the model to solve the problem and provide an overall confidence score. (2) Simple CoT: Use chain-of-thought prompting and ask for an overall confidence score at the end.",
            "Step 4: Multi-Stage Prompting Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following steps for each problem: (1) Task decomposition prompt, (2) Subtask confidence prompt, (3) Dependency mapping prompt, (4) Uncertainty propagation prompt, (5) Holistic reassessment prompt.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each problem in both datasets, collect outputs from both baseline methods and our proposed method. This includes intermediate outputs for each stage of our method.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Task accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. (2) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence estimates with its actual performance. (3) Uncertainty resolution: Assess how well the model identifies and resolves uncertainties in intermediate steps.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis, including: (1) Comparison of calibration across methods, (2) Analysis of uncertainty propagation in multi-step reasoning, (3) Identification of common patterns in task decomposition and uncertainty sources."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more, then gives 2 to his friend. How many apples does John have now? Also, provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "John has 6 apples now. Here's the calculation:\n1. John starts with 5 apples\n2. He buys 3 more: 5 + 3 = 8 apples\n3. He gives 2 to his friend: 8 - 2 = 6 apples\nTherefore, John has 6 apples now.\n\nConfidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more, then gives 2 to his friend. How many apples does John have now? Please break down this problem into subtasks.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Subtasks:\n1. Calculate the number of apples John has after buying more\n2. Calculate the final number of apples after giving some to his friend",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 2: Subtask Confidence)": "For each subtask, provide a solution and your confidence level (0-100%):\n1. Calculate the number of apples John has after buying more\n2. Calculate the final number of apples after giving some to his friend",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 2: Subtask Confidence)": "1. Calculate the number of apples John has after buying more:\n   Solution: John starts with 5 apples and buys 3 more. 5 + 3 = 8 apples\n   Confidence: 100%\n\n2. Calculate the final number of apples after giving some to his friend:\n   Solution: John had 8 apples and gives 2 to his friend. 8 - 2 = 6 apples\n   Confidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 3: Dependency Mapping)": "Identify any dependencies between the subtasks.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 3: Dependency Mapping)": "Dependency: Subtask 2 depends on the result of Subtask 1. We need to know how many apples John has after buying more (Subtask 1) before we can calculate how many he has after giving some away (Subtask 2).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 4: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Considering the confidence levels and dependencies of the subtasks, how might uncertainties propagate through the problem-solving process?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 4: Uncertainty Propagation)": "The confidence in Subtask 1 is 100%, so there's no uncertainty propagated from this step. However, Subtask 2 has a slightly lower confidence of 98%. Since Subtask 2 depends on Subtask 1, the overall uncertainty is primarily determined by Subtask 2. The small uncertainty in Subtask 2 (2%) carries through to the final answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 5: Holistic Reassessment)": "Based on the subtask solutions, confidence levels, dependencies, and uncertainty propagation, provide a final answer to the original question with an overall confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Stage Prompting; Step 5: Holistic Reassessment)": "Final Answer: John has 6 apples now.\n\nOverall Confidence: 98%\n\nExplanation: The solution process was straightforward, with high confidence in both subtasks. The slight uncertainty in Subtask 2 (98% confidence) carries through to the final answer, as it directly determines the final number of apples. Given the simplicity of the arithmetic involved and the clear problem statement, we maintain a high overall confidence of 98% in our final answer.",
            "explanation": "The multi-stage prompting approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the problem-solving process and the associated uncertainties. It breaks down the problem, assesses confidence at each step, considers dependencies, and propagates uncertainties. This results in a more calibrated final confidence estimate compared to the baseline method, which might overlook potential sources of uncertainty in intermediate steps."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-stage prompting method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine: (1) The quality and consistency of task decompositions across different problems. (2) The relationship between subtask confidences and overall task confidence. (3) The model's ability to identify and reason about dependencies between subtasks. (4) The effectiveness of the uncertainty propagation step in capturing compounding uncertainties. This analysis could lead to insights about the model's metacognitive abilities and limitations in multi-step reasoning tasks. We could also explore variations of our method, such as using different prompting strategies for each stage or incorporating external knowledge to guide the decomposition and uncertainty assessment process. Additionally, we could investigate how the performance varies across different types of reasoning tasks, which might reveal task-specific challenges in uncertainty quantification."
