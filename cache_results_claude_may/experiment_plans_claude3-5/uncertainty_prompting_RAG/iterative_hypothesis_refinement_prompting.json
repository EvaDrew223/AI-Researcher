        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to refine their hypotheses and calibrate confidence when presented with new evidence or constraints in dynamic reasoning scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on static prompts or limited iterations of refinement.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating an iterative scientific inquiry process, we can encourage models to continuously refine their hypotheses and adjust confidence levels as new information becomes available.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Hypothesis Refinement Prompting (IHRP), a dynamic prompting technique that guides the model through multiple rounds of hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement. The prompt structure for each iteration includes: 1) Current hypothesis and confidence level, 2) New evidence or constraint introduction, 3) Hypothesis update request, 4) Revised confidence elicitation, and 5) Explanation of confidence change. This process continues for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IHRP against static prompting and one-shot refinement techniques on dynamic reasoning tasks, such as scientific question answering or evolving scenario analysis. Measure improvements in final answer accuracy, confidence calibration, and the quality of intermediate hypothesis revisions."

        "Title": "Iterative Hypothesis Refinement Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification and Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to refine their hypotheses and calibrate confidence when presented with new evidence or constraints in dynamic reasoning scenarios. This limitation hinders their ability to accurately quantify uncertainty and provide well-calibrated confidence estimates in complex, evolving problem-solving tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for improving LLM reasoning typically rely on static prompts or limited iterations of refinement, which may not adequately capture the dynamic nature of scientific inquiry and hypothesis refinement. By simulating an iterative scientific inquiry process, we can encourage models to continuously refine their hypotheses and adjust confidence levels as new information becomes available, potentially leading to more accurate and better-calibrated outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Hypothesis Refinement Prompting (IHRP), a dynamic prompting technique that guides the model through multiple rounds of hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement. The prompt structure for each iteration includes: 1) Current hypothesis and confidence level, 2) New evidence or constraint introduction, 3) Hypothesis update request, 4) Revised confidence elicitation, and 5) Explanation of confidence change. This process continues for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of complex reasoning tasks that benefit from iterative refinement. We will use a combination of existing datasets: 1) Scientific QA from the AI2 Science Questions dataset, 2) Evolving scenario analysis from the COMET dataset, and 3) A subset of the TruthfulQA dataset focusing on questions that require iterative reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct prompting (single-shot), b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and c) One-shot refinement prompting.",
            "Step 3: IHRP Implementation": "Develop the IHRP method with the following components: a) Initial hypothesis generation, b) Confidence scoring mechanism, c) New evidence introduction, d) Hypothesis update prompt, e) Confidence recalibration prompt.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Setup": "For each task in the dataset: a) Apply baseline methods, b) Apply IHRP with varying numbers of iterations (1, 3, 5, and until confidence stabilizes), c) Record intermediate hypotheses, confidence scores, and final answers.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Assess performance using: a) Final answer accuracy, b) Confidence calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), c) Quality of intermediate hypothesis revisions (human evaluation), d) Convergence analysis (number of iterations until stability).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis: a) Compare IHRP against baselines, b) Analyze the impact of iteration count on performance, c) Investigate patterns in hypothesis refinement and confidence adjustment, d) Identify task types where IHRP shows the most significant improvements."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: A new virus is spreading in a population. Initially, 100 people are infected. Each day, the number of infected people doubles. How many people will be infected after 7 days?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "After 7 days, 12,800 people will be infected. This is calculated by doubling the number of infected people 7 times: 100 * 2^7 = 12,800.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IHRP; Initial Hypothesis)": "Q: A new virus is spreading in a population. Initially, 100 people are infected. Each day, the number of infected people doubles. How many people will be infected after 7 days?\n\nGenerate an initial hypothesis and provide a confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IHRP; Initial Hypothesis)": "Initial Hypothesis: After 7 days, approximately 12,800 people will be infected.\nConfidence: 80%\nExplanation: I arrived at this hypothesis by doubling the initial number of infected people (100) seven times, as the question states that the number doubles each day for 7 days. The calculation is 100 * 2^7 = 12,800. My confidence is high but not 100% because while the math seems straightforward, there might be additional factors I haven't considered.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IHRP; Iteration 1)": "New evidence: Recent studies show that after the 5th day, the rate of infection slows down due to implemented social distancing measures. The number of new cases increases by only 50% per day after day 5.\n\nBased on this new information, update your hypothesis, provide a new confidence level, and explain the change in your confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IHRP; Iteration 1)": "Updated Hypothesis: After 7 days, approximately 8,100 people will be infected.\nNew Confidence: 90%\nExplanation: With the new information, I've adjusted my calculation. For the first 5 days, the number doubles: 100 * 2^5 = 3,200. Then for days 6 and 7, it increases by 50% each day: 3,200 * 1.5 * 1.5 \u2248 7,200. I've rounded up to 8,100 to account for potential variations. My confidence has increased because this model takes into account the changing infection rate, which seems more realistic than the constant doubling in my initial hypothesis.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IHRP; Final Iteration)": "Final evidence: Health authorities have released data showing that the actual number of infected people after 7 days is 7,850.\n\nBased on this final piece of information, provide your final hypothesis, confidence level, and explain any changes in your reasoning or confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IHRP; Final Iteration)": "Final Hypothesis: After 7 days, 7,850 people are infected.\nFinal Confidence: 100%\nExplanation: The final data from health authorities confirms the actual number of infected people. My previous estimate was quite close, off by only about 3%. This increases my confidence in the model that accounted for the slowing infection rate after day 5. The slight discrepancy could be due to rounding or small variations in the daily increase percentages. Given that this is now confirmed data, my confidence is 100%.",
            "explanation": "The IHRP method allows for iterative refinement of the hypothesis based on new evidence, leading to a more accurate final answer and better-calibrated confidence levels. The baseline method, while providing a correct mathematical calculation, doesn't account for real-world complexities that the IHRP method can incorporate through its iterative process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IHRP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the iterative refinement process, examining how hypotheses and confidence levels change across iterations. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential limitations. 2) Investigate the impact of different prompt structures within the IHRP framework, such as varying the way new evidence is presented or how confidence recalibration is requested. 3) Explore the effectiveness of IHRP across different types of reasoning tasks to identify specific domains where it's most beneficial. 4) Analyze cases where IHRP performs poorly to understand its limitations and propose potential improvements. 5) Compare IHRP with other advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency methods to identify complementary strengths that could be combined into a more robust approach."
