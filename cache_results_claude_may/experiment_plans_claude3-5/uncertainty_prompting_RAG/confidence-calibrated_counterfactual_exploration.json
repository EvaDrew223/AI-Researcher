    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in their outputs, particularly when faced with ambiguous or out-of-distribution queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include direct confidence elicitation and ensemble-based methods.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring counterfactual scenarios, we can probe the model's knowledge boundaries and calibrate its confidence more accurately.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting process: 1) Generate Counterfactuals: Given an input query, prompt the model to generate multiple counterfactual scenarios that could change the answer. 2) Confidence Calibration: For each counterfactual, prompt the model to assess how it impacts the original answer and confidence. The final confidence score is derived from the aggregation of these assessments. Prompts will include instructions like 'Generate 5 plausible scenarios that could change the answer to this question' and 'For each scenario, explain how it impacts your original answer and adjust your confidence accordingly'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on existing uncertainty quantification benchmarks like TruthfulQA and SciQ, comparing against baselines such as direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods. Measure calibration using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in their outputs, particularly when faced with ambiguous or out-of-distribution queries. This can lead to overconfident predictions on incorrect or uncertain answers, potentially misleading users and causing downstream issues in decision-making processes.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as direct confidence elicitation and ensemble-based approaches, have limitations. Direct confidence elicitation can be unreliable due to the model's tendency to be overconfident, while ensemble methods can be computationally expensive and may not capture all sources of uncertainty. By exploring counterfactual scenarios, we can probe the model's knowledge boundaries and calibrate its confidence more accurately. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about alternative scenarios, potentially leading to more nuanced and reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting process for improved uncertainty quantification:\n1. Generate Counterfactuals: Given an input query, prompt the model to generate multiple counterfactual scenarios that could change the answer.\n2. Confidence Calibration: For each counterfactual, prompt the model to assess how it impacts the original answer and confidence. The final confidence score is derived from the aggregation of these assessments.\n\nPrompts will include instructions like 'Generate 5 plausible scenarios that could change the answer to this question' and 'For each scenario, explain how it impacts your original answer and adjust your confidence accordingly'. The final confidence score will be calculated based on the stability of the answer across counterfactuals and the model's self-reported confidence adjustments.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare evaluation datasets: TruthfulQA for assessing factual accuracy and uncertainty, and SciQ for scientific question-answering. Split each dataset into development and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\na) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each query.\nb) Ensemble method: Use 5 different sampling temperatures and aggregate predictions.",
            "Step 3: Counterfactual Prompting Implementation": "Develop prompts for counterfactual generation and confidence calibration. Example prompts:\n- Counterfactual generation: 'Generate 5 plausible scenarios that could change the answer to this question: [QUESTION]'\n- Confidence calibration: 'For each scenario, explain how it impacts your original answer and adjust your confidence accordingly. Original answer: [ANSWER], Original confidence: [CONFIDENCE]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets:\na) Generate baseline answers and confidence scores using direct elicitation and ensemble methods.\nb) Apply counterfactual prompting method:\n   - Generate initial answer and confidence\n   - Generate counterfactuals\n   - Assess impact of each counterfactual on answer and confidence\n   - Aggregate results to produce final confidence score",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate methods using:\na) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)\nb) Brier Score for probabilistic predictions\nc) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for uncertainty ranking",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare performance of baseline methods and counterfactual prompting across different question types and difficulty levels. Analyze patterns in generated counterfactuals and their impact on confidence calibration."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nA: Neil Armstrong\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Output": "I am 100% confident in my answer that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method shows high confidence without considering potential uncertainties or alternative scenarios."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nA: Neil Armstrong\nInitial confidence: 100%\nGenerate 5 plausible scenarios that could change the answer to this question.",
                "Output": "1. Discovery of classified documents revealing a secret earlier moon landing.\n2. New evidence suggesting the moon landings were faked.\n3. Redefining 'walking on the moon' to include robotic missions.\n4. Historical records being misinterpreted, and another astronaut actually stepped out first.\n5. Time travel altering the course of history.\n\nFor each scenario, explain how it impacts your original answer and adjust your confidence accordingly:\n\n1. This would completely change the answer. Confidence reduced to 80%.\n2. This would invalidate the entire premise. Confidence reduced to 70%.\n3. This wouldn't change Neil Armstrong being the first human, but might change the interpretation. Confidence adjusted to 90%.\n4. This could potentially change the answer if verified. Confidence reduced to 85%.\n5. This is highly implausible but would change everything if true. Confidence remains at 95%.\n\nFinal calibrated confidence: 84%",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method generates diverse counterfactuals and assesses their impact, leading to a more nuanced and lower confidence score that better reflects potential uncertainties."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed counterfactual prompting method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why LLMs struggle with uncertainty quantification. We would conduct a detailed error analysis of the generated counterfactuals and confidence adjustments, categorizing the types of scenarios that lead to over- or under-confidence. Additionally, we could investigate how the model's behavior changes across different domains (e.g., factual vs. scientific questions) and levels of factual certainty. This analysis could provide insights into the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about uncertainty and inform future research directions for improving confidence calibration techniques."
