    "idea_name": "Probabilistic Prompt Ensemble",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in LLMs often rely on single-point estimates or require multiple forward passes, which can be computationally expensive and may not capture the full range of model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches include dropout-based uncertainty estimation and ensemble methods that require training multiple models.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the success of ensemble methods in machine learning, we propose to create a diverse set of prompts that can capture different aspects of model uncertainty without requiring multiple model instances or forward passes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Prompt Ensemble (PPE), a method that generates a set of stochastic prompts for a given input. Each prompt in the ensemble is designed to probe a different aspect of the model's knowledge or reasoning process. For example, given a question Q, we might generate prompts like: 'What is the probability that the answer to Q is X?', 'What evidence supports and refutes the answer to Q?', 'How confident are you in answering Q on a scale of 1-10?'. The responses to these prompts are then aggregated using a probabilistic framework to estimate the model's overall uncertainty. The prompt generation process itself is guided by a meta-prompt that ensures diversity and relevance of the generated prompts.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PPE against standard uncertainty estimation methods on various tasks including question-answering, fact verification, and reasoning tasks. We will measure calibration, sharpness, and other uncertainty metrics. Additionally, we will analyze the diversity and effectiveness of the generated prompt ensembles."

        "Title": "Probabilistic Prompt Ensemble: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Diverse Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-point estimates or require multiple forward passes, which can be computationally expensive and may not capture the full range of model uncertainty. We aim to develop a more efficient and comprehensive method for uncertainty quantification in LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like dropout-based uncertainty estimation and ensemble methods that require training multiple models are computationally intensive and may not be practical for large-scale applications. Inspired by the success of ensemble methods in machine learning and the power of prompting in LLMs, we propose to create a diverse set of prompts that can capture different aspects of model uncertainty without requiring multiple model instances or forward passes. This method leverages the LLM's ability to respond to various prompts, potentially offering a more nuanced view of its uncertainty across different aspects of knowledge and reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Prompt Ensemble (PPE), a method that generates a set of stochastic prompts for a given input. Each prompt in the ensemble is designed to probe a different aspect of the model's knowledge or reasoning process. For a given question Q, we generate prompts like: 'What is the probability that the answer to Q is X?', 'What evidence supports and refutes the answer to Q?', 'How confident are you in answering Q on a scale of 1-10?'. The responses to these prompts are then aggregated using a probabilistic framework to estimate the model's overall uncertainty. The prompt generation process is guided by a meta-prompt that ensures diversity and relevance of the generated prompts.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and (3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of tasks and difficulty levels, allowing us to evaluate PPE's performance across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: simply ask the question, (2) Temperature sampling: generate multiple answers with different temperature settings, (3) Few-shot CoT: use chain-of-thought prompting with few-shot examples. For each baseline, we'll use the same LLM API calls and compute uncertainty estimates based on the distribution of outputs or confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: PPE Implementation": "Implement the Probabilistic Prompt Ensemble method: (a) Design a meta-prompt to generate diverse question-specific prompts. Example: 'Generate 5 diverse prompts to assess the model's uncertainty in answering the following question: [QUESTION]'. (b) For each input question, use the meta-prompt to generate a set of 5-10 diverse prompts. (c) Query the LLM with each generated prompt and collect the responses. (d) Implement an aggregation method to combine the responses into an uncertainty estimate. This could involve statistical measures like variance or entropy of the responses, or a learned aggregation function.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate uncertainty quantification: (1) Calibration error: measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. (2) Brier score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): measure the difference between confidence and accuracy. (4) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC): evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect predictions based on uncertainty.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "(a) For each dataset and each method (baselines and PPE), generate predictions and uncertainty estimates for all questions. (b) Compute all evaluation metrics for each method on each dataset. (c) Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare PPE against the baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "(a) Compare PPE's performance against baselines across different datasets and metrics. (b) Analyze the diversity and effectiveness of the generated prompt ensembles. (c) Investigate how PPE performs on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning). (d) Examine cases where PPE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PPE; Step 1: Generate Diverse Prompts)": "Generate 5 diverse prompts to assess the model's uncertainty in answering the following question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PPE; Step 1: Generate Diverse Prompts)": "1. What is the probability that Paris is the capital of France?\n2. List three pieces of evidence supporting Paris as the capital of France and one potential counterargument.\n3. On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you know the capital of France?\n4. What are the top 3 most likely cities to be the capital of France, and why?\n5. Imagine you're a historian. What historical events or facts would you cite to prove that Paris is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PPE; Step 2: Query with Generated Prompts)": "[Use each of the generated prompts to query the LLM]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PPE; Step 2: Query with Generated Prompts)": "[Collect responses for each prompt]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PPE; Step 3: Aggregate Responses)": "[Input the collected responses into the aggregation function]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PPE; Step 3: Aggregate Responses)": "Final answer: Paris\nUncertainty estimate: 0.02 (very low uncertainty)",
            "explanation": "PPE generates a diverse set of prompts that probe different aspects of the model's knowledge and confidence. By aggregating responses to these prompts, we can obtain a more nuanced uncertainty estimate compared to direct prompting."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PPE doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can explore several directions: (1) Analyze the generated prompts to understand if they're sufficiently diverse and relevant. We might need to refine the meta-prompt or develop a more sophisticated prompt generation method. (2) Investigate the aggregation method - perhaps a more complex aggregation function, possibly using a small neural network, could better capture the uncertainty information from the diverse responses. (3) Conduct an ablation study to understand which components of PPE contribute most to its performance, and focus on improving those. (4) If the method still doesn't show improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper, examining why diverse prompting doesn't capture uncertainty as well as expected. This could involve a detailed study of how LLMs respond to different types of uncertainty-probing prompts, potentially uncovering interesting insights about the models' behavior under uncertainty."
