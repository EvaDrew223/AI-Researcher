    "idea_name": "Metamorphic Uncertainty Quantification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often rely on static prompts or predefined metrics, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty across different problem formulations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like ensemble methods, dropout, or temperature scaling to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by metamorphic testing in software engineering, we propose that by systematically transforming inputs while preserving semantic equivalence, we can probe the model's uncertainty landscape more comprehensively.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Uncertainty Quantification (MUQ), a novel prompting technique that generates a series of semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse prompts for a given query. MUQ employs a set of predefined transformation rules (e.g., paraphrasing, logical equivalence, perspective shifting) to create these variants. The LLM is then prompted to answer each variant and provide a confidence score. By analyzing the distribution and consistency of these scores across transformations, MUQ computes a robust uncertainty estimate that accounts for the model's sensitivity to different problem formulations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MUQ against standard uncertainty quantification methods on diverse tasks including question answering, sentiment analysis, and reasoning. We'll use metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and uncertainty-aware F1 score to assess performance. Additionally, we'll conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of different transformation types on uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Metamorphic Uncertainty Quantification: Probing LLM Confidence Through Input Transformations",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on static prompts or predefined metrics, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty across different problem formulations. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions in scenarios where the model's understanding is actually limited or inconsistent.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like ensemble methods, dropout, or temperature scaling to estimate uncertainty. However, these methods may not fully capture the model's sensitivity to different problem formulations. Inspired by metamorphic testing in software engineering, we propose that by systematically transforming inputs while preserving semantic equivalence, we can probe the model's uncertainty landscape more comprehensively. This approach leverages the LLM's own capabilities to generate and respond to diverse formulations of the same query, potentially revealing inconsistencies or areas of low confidence that static methods might miss.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Uncertainty Quantification (MUQ), a novel prompting technique that generates a series of semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse prompts for a given query.

The LLM is then prompted to answer each variant and provide a confidence score.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering different tasks: 1) Question Answering: SQuAD 2.0, 2) Sentiment Analysis: IMDb Movie Reviews, 3) Reasoning: SWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods as baselines: a) Monte Carlo Dropout, b) Ensemble of models, c) Temperature scaling.",
            "Step 3: MUQ Implementation": "Develop the MUQ pipeline: a) Define transformation rules (paraphrasing, logical equivalence, perspective shifting), b) Implement a prompt generator using these rules, c) Create a scoring mechanism for confidence estimation.",
            "Step 4: Experimental Setup": "For each dataset and task: a) Select a subset of examples (e.g., 1000 instances), b) Apply baselines and MUQ to generate uncertainty estimates, c) Use GPT-4 as the primary model, with GPT-3.5 for ablation studies.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Assess performance using: a) Calibration error, b) Brier score, c) Uncertainty-aware F1 score.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of: a) Different transformation types, b) Number of transformations used, c) Confidence scoring mechanisms.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: a) Compare MUQ against baselines across different tasks, b) Identify scenarios where MUQ outperforms or underperforms, c) Examine the relationship between input transformations and uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single high-confidence answer without exploring alternative formulations."
            },
            "MUQ Example": {
                "Input": "Apply MUQ to the question: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "Transformed queries and responses:\n1. Q: Which city serves as the capital of the French Republic? A: Paris. Confidence: 0.98\n2. Q: If I were to visit France's seat of government, what city would I be in? A: Paris. Confidence: 0.97\n3. Q: Name the French city known for the Eiffel Tower and also being the nation's capital. A: Paris. Confidence: 0.99\n4. Q: What's the political and cultural heart of France? A: Paris. Confidence: 0.96\n5. Q: In terms of capital cities, which one represents France? A: Paris. Confidence: 0.98\n\nFinal MUQ uncertainty estimate: 0.02 (based on the variance of confidence scores)",
                "Explanation": "MUQ generates multiple semantically equivalent queries, obtaining confidence scores for each. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the distribution of these scores, providing a more robust measure of the model's confidence across different formulations of the same question."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MUQ does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will pivot to an analysis-focused approach. We'll investigate patterns in how different types of input transformations affect uncertainty estimates across various tasks. This could involve clustering transformation types and analyzing their impact on model confidence, potentially revealing insights into the model's sensitivity to specific linguistic features or reasoning patterns. Additionally, we'll explore whether MUQ can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify specific weaknesses in model reasoning or knowledge gaps, even if it doesn't improve overall uncertainty quantification. This analysis could inform the development of more targeted uncertainty estimation techniques or highlight areas where models need improvement in handling diverse input formulations."
