        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Contextual Calibration (CCC): 1) Context Variation: For a given query, create multiple versions with varying levels of context (e.g., no context, partial context, full context, misleading context). 2) Contrastive Prompting: Present these context variations to the LLM sequentially, prompting it to answer and provide confidence scores for each. 3) Confidence Delta Analysis: Analyze how the LLM's confidence changes across context variations. 4) Calibration Feedback: Provide explicit feedback on how confidence should ideally change with context. 5) Meta-Learning: Through repeated exposure to this process, prompt the LLM to internalize principles of context-dependent confidence calibration.",

        "Title": "Contrastive Contextual Calibration: Improving LLM Confidence Estimation through Context Variation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to adjust their confidence appropriately when given different amounts or quality of context. This leads to overconfidence in situations with limited or misleading information, and underconfidence when ample, high-quality context is available. Addressing this issue is crucial for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods primarily focus on calibrating confidence for a single, fixed context. However, human confidence naturally varies with the amount and reliability of available information. By explicitly contrasting different contexts, we aim to help LLMs develop more nuanced confidence estimates that better reflect the quality and quantity of available information. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where we constantly adjust our certainty based on the information at hand.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Contextual Calibration (CCC), a novel prompting method designed to improve LLMs' confidence estimation across varying contexts. CCC consists of five key steps: 1) Context Variation: For a given query, create multiple versions with varying levels of context (e.g., no context, partial context, full context, misleading context). 2) Contrastive Prompting: Present these context variations to the LLM sequentially, prompting it to answer and provide confidence scores for each. 3) Confidence Delta Analysis: Analyze how the LLM's confidence changes across context variations. 4) Calibration Feedback: Provide explicit feedback on how confidence should ideally change with context. 5) Meta-Learning: Through repeated exposure to this process, prompt the LLM to internalize principles of context-dependent confidence calibration.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a new benchmark dataset featuring questions with multiple context variations. Use existing QA datasets (e.g., SQuAD, TriviaQA) as a starting point. For each question, generate four versions: no context, partial context, full context, and misleading context. Ensure a balanced distribution of topics and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence elicitation methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting: Ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. b) Calibrated prompting: Use existing calibration techniques like temperature scaling or Platt scaling. c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with confidence: Implement CoT prompting with an additional step for confidence estimation.",
            "Step 3: CCC Implementation": "Implement the Contrastive Contextual Calibration method: a) Context Variation: For each question, prepare prompts with different context levels. b) Contrastive Prompting: Design a prompt template that presents context variations sequentially and asks for answers and confidence scores. c) Confidence Delta Analysis: Implement a function to calculate confidence changes across contexts. d) Calibration Feedback: Design prompts that provide feedback on ideal confidence adjustments. e) Meta-Learning: Create a meta-prompt that encourages the model to internalize context-dependent calibration principles.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Choose a set of LLMs for evaluation, including: a) GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) b) GPT-4 c) Claude 2 d) PaLM 2 e) LLaMA 2 (70B chat model)",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, Maximum Calibration Error) b) Brier score c) Confidence-performance correlation d) Context sensitivity (measure of how confidence changes with context) e) Transfer performance (on unseen tasks)",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each model and method combination: a) Run inference on the benchmark dataset. b) Collect model outputs, including answers and confidence scores. c) Calculate evaluation metrics. d) Repeat the process for multiple runs to ensure statistical significance.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of each CCC component: a) Remove confidence delta analysis b) Remove calibration feedback c) Remove meta-learning step d) Vary the number and types of context variations",
            "Step 8: Analysis and Visualization": "a) Create plots comparing calibration curves across methods and models. b) Generate heatmaps showing confidence changes across context variations. c) Perform statistical tests to determine significance of improvements. d) Analyze examples where CCC significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.",
            "Step 9: Generalization Tests": "Evaluate the generalization of CCC: a) Test on out-of-distribution questions and topics. b) Evaluate performance on different task types (e.g., summarization, sentiment analysis). c) Assess transfer learning capabilities by fine-tuning on a small set of examples and testing on a new domain."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? I will provide you with different levels of context. For each, please provide an answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\n1. No context: [No additional information provided]\n2. Partial context: France is a country in Western Europe.\n3. Full context: France is a country in Western Europe. Its capital city is located on the River Seine and is known for landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre museum.\n4. Misleading context: France is a country in Western Europe. Many people mistakenly believe its capital is Lyon, a major city in the east-central part of the country.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. No context:\nA: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.9\n\n2. Partial context:\nA: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.95\n\n3. Full context:\nA: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99\n\n4. Misleading context:\nA: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.85\n\nExplanation: My confidence varies based on the amount and quality of context provided. With no context, I'm fairly confident but not certain. With partial context, my confidence increases slightly. The full context provides specific details about the capital, greatly increasing my confidence. The misleading context introduces doubt, causing me to lower my confidence while still maintaining the correct answer based on my prior knowledge.",
            "explanation": "The CCC method demonstrates the model's ability to adjust its confidence based on the quality and quantity of context provided. This contrasts with the baseline method, which provides a single confidence score without considering variations in available information."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCC method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how different types of context affect LLM confidence, potentially uncovering insights about model behavior and limitations. 2) Explore alternative ways of presenting context variations, such as simultaneous presentation or iterative refinement, to see if these approaches yield better results. 3) Investigate the relationship between confidence calibration and other aspects of model performance, such as factual accuracy or reasoning ability. 4) Develop a new benchmark for evaluating context-dependent confidence estimation, which could be valuable for future research in this area. 5) Explore the potential of fine-tuning smaller open-source models on the CCC task, comparing the results to the prompt-based approach with larger models. These alternative directions could still yield valuable contributions to the field of LLM confidence calibration and uncertainty quantification."
