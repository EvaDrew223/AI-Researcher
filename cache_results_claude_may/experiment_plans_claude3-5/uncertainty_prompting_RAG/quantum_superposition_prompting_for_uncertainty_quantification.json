        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simplistic confidence scores or ensemble techniques, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Typical approaches include softmax probabilities, Monte Carlo dropout, and ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Quantum mechanics offers a framework for representing multiple states simultaneously, which could be analogous to an LLM considering multiple possible answers concurrently.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), which instructs the LLM to generate multiple potential answers in a 'superposition' state. The prompt asks the model to consider N different 'universes' simultaneously, each with a different answer. The model then assigns complex-valued amplitudes to each answer, representing both the likelihood and phase of each possibility. Finally, the model 'collapses' this superposition by performing a measurement, yielding both an answer and a quantified uncertainty based on the interference patterns of the amplitudes.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare QSP against baseline methods on various question-answering and decision-making tasks. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and a novel 'quantum uncertainty score' based on the interference patterns of the superposition states."

        "Title": "Quantum Superposition Prompting: A Novel Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic confidence scores or ensemble techniques, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions and unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like softmax probabilities, Monte Carlo dropout, and ensemble techniques have limitations in capturing the nuanced uncertainties in LLM outputs. Quantum mechanics offers a framework for representing multiple states simultaneously, which could be analogous to an LLM considering multiple possible answers concurrently. By leveraging this concept, we aim to develop a more sophisticated method for uncertainty quantification that can better represent the model's confidence across a spectrum of possible answers.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), which instructs the LLM to generate multiple potential answers in a 'superposition' state. The process involves the following steps:\n1. Prompt the LLM to consider N different 'universes' simultaneously, each with a different answer.\n2. Instruct the model to assign complex-valued amplitudes to each answer, representing both the likelihood and phase of each possibility.\n3. Ask the model to 'collapse' this superposition by performing a measurement, yielding both an answer and a quantified uncertainty based on the interference patterns of the amplitudes.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method:\n1. TruthfulQA: A dataset for measuring LLM truthfulness.\n2. AmbigQA: A dataset containing ambiguous questions with multiple valid answers.\n3. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A dataset covering 57 tasks including mathematics, history, law, and more.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods:\n1. Direct prompting with confidence score (using the model's raw logit output).\n2. Monte Carlo Dropout (if using an open-source model where we can modify the forward pass).\n3. Ensemble method using different few-shot prompts.",
            "Step 3: QSP Implementation": "Implement the Quantum Superposition Prompting method:\n1. Design a prompt template that instructs the model to generate N different answers (e.g., N=5) in separate 'universes'.\n2. Extend the prompt to ask for complex-valued amplitudes for each answer.\n3. Implement a 'measurement' step that collapses the superposition based on the amplitudes.\n4. Calculate a 'quantum uncertainty score' based on the interference patterns of the amplitudes.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and QSP):\n1. Generate answers and uncertainty scores for all questions.\n2. For TruthfulQA and MMLU, calculate accuracy and calibration metrics.\n3. For AmbigQA, evaluate the diversity and relevance of generated answers.\n4. Compare the performance of QSP against the baselines.",
            "Step 5: Analysis": "1. Compare calibration curves of QSP vs baselines.\n2. Analyze the relationship between the quantum uncertainty score and actual correctness.\n3. Examine cases where QSP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\n4. Investigate the impact of varying N (number of 'universes') on performance.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "1. Compare QSP with a simplified version that uses only real-valued amplitudes.\n2. Evaluate the impact of different 'measurement' strategies in the final step.\n3. Assess the effect of different prompt formulations for generating the superposition state."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nConfidence: 0.95",
            "QSP Prompt Input": "Consider 5 parallel universes, each with a potentially different answer to the question: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? For each universe, provide an answer and assign it a complex-valued amplitude where the magnitude represents the likelihood and the phase represents any uncertainty or ambiguity. Then, perform a 'measurement' to collapse these possibilities into a final answer with an associated quantum uncertainty score.",
            "QSP Prompt Expected Output": "Universe 1: Neil Armstrong | Amplitude: 0.9 + 0.1i\nUniverse 2: Buzz Aldrin | Amplitude: 0.3 - 0.2i\nUniverse 3: Yuri Gagarin | Amplitude: 0.1 + 0.05i\nUniverse 4: John Glenn | Amplitude: 0.05 - 0.05i\nUniverse 5: Alan Shepard | Amplitude: 0.02 + 0.01i\n\nMeasurement result: Neil Armstrong\nQuantum Uncertainty Score: 0.18",
            "Explanation": "The QSP method generates multiple possible answers with complex amplitudes, allowing for a more nuanced representation of uncertainty. The final measurement provides both an answer and a quantum uncertainty score, which captures more information about the model's confidence and potential alternatives compared to a simple confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If QSP does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the generated superposition states to gain insights into how LLMs represent uncertainty across multiple possibilities. This could lead to a paper on the internal representations of uncertainty in LLMs.\n2. Investigate whether the complex-valued amplitudes provide any additional information compared to real-valued probabilities. If not, we could simplify the method to use only real-valued amplitudes and focus on the benefits of considering multiple answers simultaneously.\n3. Explore how QSP performs on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. opinion-based) and analyze why it might work better for certain categories. This could lead to a targeted application of QSP for specific types of queries.\n4. Combine QSP with other techniques like chain-of-thought prompting to see if we can improve both reasoning and uncertainty quantification simultaneously.\n5. If the 'quantum' aspect doesn't provide significant benefits, we could reframe the project as a study on 'multi-verse prompting' and focus on how considering multiple parallel answers affects the model's final output and confidence."
