    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often produce inconsistent answers to the same question over time, but this temporal inconsistency is not typically factored into uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods usually focus on single-instance confidence estimation or ensemble-based approaches.",
        "Motivation": "By examining the model's consistency over time, we can gain insights into its true uncertainty, similar to how human confidence often correlates with answer consistency.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a temporal prompting strategy: 1) Initial Response: Generate an answer and confidence estimate. 2) Temporal Delay: Introduce a 'delay' by inserting unrelated prompts or tasks. 3) Repeated Query: Re-ask the original question after the delay. 4) Consistency Analysis: Compare the two responses and prompt the model to analyze any discrepancies. 5) Uncertainty Recalibration: Based on the consistency analysis, refine the uncertainty estimate. Prompts will include instructions like 'Compare your current answer to your previous one. Analyze any differences and explain their significance' and 'Based on the consistency of your answers, refine your uncertainty estimate'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test on various QA datasets, comparing against single-instance and ensemble methods. Evaluate using calibration metrics and measure the correlation between answer consistency and refined uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers to the same question over time, but this temporal inconsistency is not typically factored into uncertainty estimates. Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs do not adequately capture this temporal variability, potentially leading to overconfident or miscalibrated predictions.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs usually focus on single-instance confidence estimation or ensemble-based approaches. However, these methods fail to capture the temporal inconsistency inherent in LLM responses. By examining the model's consistency over time, we can gain insights into its true uncertainty, similar to how human confidence often correlates with answer consistency. This approach leverages the LLM's own capabilities to analyze its responses over time, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates without the need for extensive model modifications or external data.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a temporal prompting strategy that consists of five main steps: 1) Initial Response: Generate an answer and confidence estimate. 2) Temporal Delay: Introduce a 'delay' by inserting unrelated prompts or tasks. 3) Repeated Query: Re-ask the original question after the delay. 4) Consistency Analysis: Compare the two responses and prompt the model to analyze any discrepancies. 5) Uncertainty Recalibration: Based on the consistency analysis, refine the uncertainty estimate. The prompts will include instructions like 'Compare your current answer to your previous one. Analyze any differences and explain their significance' and 'Based on the consistency of your answers, refine your uncertainty estimate'.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse QA datasets that cover a range of domains and difficulty levels. We will use: 1) TriviaQA for general knowledge questions, 2) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension, and 3) ARC-Challenge for science questions. These datasets provide a good mix of question types and difficulties.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Single-instance confidence estimation: Use the model's output probability as a confidence score. 2) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses using different random seeds and use the variance as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: Temporal Consistency Prompting Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation with confidence estimate. b) Temporal delay implementation (insert 3-5 unrelated questions). c) Repeated query. d) Consistency analysis prompting. e) Uncertainty recalibration prompting.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments. These models are widely used and provide a good representation of current LLM capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and proposed): a) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates for all questions. b) For the proposed method, ensure to include the temporal delay and repeated querying. c) Record all intermediate steps (initial response, delayed response, consistency analysis, recalibrated uncertainty).",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error). 2) Brier score. 3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for uncertainty estimates. 4) Spearman correlation between uncertainty estimates and actual errors.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis: 1) Compare the proposed method against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze how the length of temporal delay affects performance. 3) Examine the relationship between answer consistency and uncertainty estimates. 4) Investigate cases where the proposed method significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score based on the model's output probability, which may not capture temporal inconsistency."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence: 0.95"
                },
                "Step 2 - Temporal Delay": {
                    "Input": "Q1: What is the largest planet in our solar system? Q2: Who wrote 'Pride and Prejudice'? Q3: What is the chemical symbol for gold?",
                    "Output": "(Responses to unrelated questions)"
                },
                "Step 3 - Repeated Query": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris."
                },
                "Step 4 - Consistency Analysis": {
                    "Input": "Compare your current answer to your previous one. Analyze any differences and explain their significance.",
                    "Output": "My current answer is consistent with my previous answer. Both times I stated that the capital of France is Paris. This consistency suggests a high level of certainty in the answer."
                },
                "Step 5 - Uncertainty Recalibration": {
                    "Input": "Based on the consistency of your answers, refine your uncertainty estimate.",
                    "Output": "Given the perfect consistency between my initial and repeated answers, I would maintain a high confidence in this answer. Refined confidence: 0.98"
                },
                "Explanation": "The proposed method captures temporal consistency, allowing for a more nuanced uncertainty estimate. In this case, the consistency led to a slight increase in confidence."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed temporal consistency prompting method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty estimates, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the patterns of inconsistency across different types of questions or knowledge domains, which could provide insights into the model's knowledge representation and retrieval processes. Second, we could investigate how different temporal delay lengths and types of intervening tasks affect consistency, potentially revealing interesting properties of the model's memory and context handling. Third, we could explore combining our method with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as calibrated ensembles or temperature scaling, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Lastly, we could shift focus to use the temporal consistency as a tool for detecting potential hallucinations or false memories in LLMs, turning the project into an analysis of LLM reliability rather than just uncertainty estimation."
