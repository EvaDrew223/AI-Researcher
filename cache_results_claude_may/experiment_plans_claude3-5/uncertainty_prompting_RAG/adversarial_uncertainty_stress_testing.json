        "Problem": "LLMs often display overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize edge cases or adversarial inputs that should increase uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods typically focus on in-distribution examples and don't explicitly probe the boundaries of model knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically generating adversarial inputs designed to challenge the model's confidence, we can improve uncertainty estimation for edge cases and out-of-distribution queries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Uncertainty Stress Testing (AUST): 1) Given an input query, prompt the LLM to generate multiple adversarial variations designed to increase uncertainty (e.g., introducing conflicting information, edge cases, or rare contexts). 2) Present each adversarial query variant to the model, collecting answers and uncertainty estimates. 3) Prompt the model to analyze how its confidence changes across variants and why. 4) Use this analysis to adjust the uncertainty estimate for the original query, incorporating learned insights about potential failure modes. 5) Optionally, use the generated adversarial examples to fine-tune the model's uncertainty estimation capabilities.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate AUST against standard uncertainty estimation techniques on carefully curated test sets designed to probe model limitations, including adversarial examples and out-of-distribution queries. Measure improvements in uncertainty calibration, especially for edge cases and potential failure modes."

        "Title": "Adversarial Uncertainty Stress Testing (AUST): Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize edge cases or adversarial inputs that should increase uncertainty. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable or potentially harmful outputs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods typically focus on in-distribution examples and don't explicitly probe the boundaries of model knowledge. By systematically generating adversarial inputs designed to challenge the model's confidence, we can improve uncertainty estimation for edge cases and out-of-distribution queries. This approach leverages the LLM's own capabilities to generate challenging scenarios, potentially uncovering blind spots in its knowledge and reasoning abilities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Uncertainty Stress Testing (AUST), a multi-step process to improve uncertainty estimation in LLMs: 1) Given an input query, prompt the LLM to generate multiple adversarial variations designed to increase uncertainty (e.g., introducing conflicting information, edge cases, or rare contexts). 2) Present each adversarial query variant to the model, collecting answers and uncertainty estimates. 3) Prompt the model to analyze how its confidence changes across variants and why. 4) Use this analysis to adjust the uncertainty estimate for the original query, incorporating learned insights about potential failure modes. 5) Optionally, use the generated adversarial examples to fine-tune the model's uncertainty estimation capabilities.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of existing datasets and custom-created test sets: a) QA datasets: SQuAD 2.0 and TriviaQA for factual knowledge. b) Reasoning datasets: MMLU for multi-domain reasoning. c) Custom adversarial set: Create a small set of 100 hand-crafted adversarial examples across various domains to serve as a challenging test bed.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement and evaluate standard uncertainty estimation techniques: a) Softmax probabilities b) Monte Carlo Dropout c) Ensemble methods (if computationally feasible) d) Calibrated regression",
            "Step 3: AUST Implementation": "a) Adversarial Variation Generation: Prompt: \"Given the question '{original_question}', generate 3 variations that introduce uncertainty or ambiguity while maintaining relevance to the original topic. These variations should challenge the model's confidence.\" b) Uncertainty Collection: For each variant and the original question, collect model outputs and uncertainty estimates using the baseline methods. c) Confidence Analysis: Prompt: \"Analyze how your confidence changed across the original question and its variants. Explain the reasons for any shifts in certainty.\" d) Uncertainty Adjustment: Prompt: \"Based on your analysis of confidence changes, provide an adjusted uncertainty estimate for the original question '{original_question}'. Explain your reasoning.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our main experiments. Additionally, we'll use the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "a) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error, Maximum Calibration Error) b) Brier score c) AUC-ROC for uncertainty threshold d) F1 score for 'don't know' predictions (for datasets with unanswerable questions) e) Human evaluation of uncertainty reasonableness on a subset of examples",
            "Step 6: Experiments": "a) Run baseline methods on all datasets. b) Apply AUST to all datasets, collecting results for each step. c) Compare AUST results with baselines using the defined metrics. d) Analyze the generated adversarial variations and confidence analyses for insights into model behavior. e) Optionally, fine-tune a smaller open-source model (e.g., LLAMA-2-7B) on the generated adversarial examples and evaluate improvements.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare AUST performance against baselines across different question types and domains. b) Analyze cases where AUST significantly improves or degrades performance. c) Evaluate the quality and diversity of generated adversarial variations. d) Assess the coherence and usefulness of the model's confidence analyses. e) Investigate any emergent patterns in the types of variations that most effectively challenge the model."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 99%)"
            },
            "AUST Example": {
                "Step 1: Original Question": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 2: Generated Variations": "1. In an alternate history where Napoleon never rose to power, what might be the capital of France? 2. Considering both cultural and economic factors, could one argue that another city functions as a 'second capital' of France? 3. If climate change causes sea levels to rise significantly, how might the capital of France change in the next century?",
                "Step 3: Variant Answers": "1. In an alternate history without Napoleon, the capital of France might still be Paris, but it's difficult to say with certainty. Other possibilities could include Versailles or Lyon. (Confidence: 60%) 2. While Paris is the official capital, one could argue that cities like Lyon or Marseille function as 'second capitals' in terms of economic or cultural importance. However, this is subjective and debatable. (Confidence: 75%) 3. It's highly speculative to predict how climate change might affect the capital of France in a century. Paris could remain the capital but with significant adaptations, or a new inland location might be chosen. (Confidence: 40%)",
                "Step 4: Confidence Analysis": "My confidence varied significantly across the variants. For the original question, I was highly confident because it's a well-established fact. The alternate history question introduced uncertainty due to its speculative nature. The 'second capital' question allowed for some confidence in discussing real cities, but the subjectivity reduced overall certainty. The climate change question was the most uncertain due to its long-term speculation and complex factors involved.",
                "Step 5: Adjusted Answer": "The current capital of France is Paris. (Adjusted Confidence: 95%) While this is a well-established fact, the variations highlighted potential sources of uncertainty in different contexts. Historical changes, cultural/economic factors, or long-term environmental shifts could theoretically affect this answer, though the likelihood of change in the near future is very low."
            },
            "Explanation": "The AUST method demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty. While the baseline confidently states the factual answer, AUST explores potential edge cases and future scenarios that could affect the certainty of the answer. This process leads to a slightly reduced but more realistic confidence level, acknowledging the potential for change or alternative interpretations while still asserting the current factual answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If AUST doesn't significantly improve uncertainty estimation, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated adversarial examples to understand what types of variations most effectively challenge LLMs. This could provide insights into model limitations and potential improvements in training data or architectures. 2) Investigate whether the confidence analysis step alone (without adjusting the final answer) provides valuable insights into model reasoning and uncertainty. This could lead to a new method for explicating model uncertainty without necessarily changing the output. 3) Explore using AUST as a data augmentation technique for fine-tuning smaller models on uncertainty estimation, even if it doesn't directly improve large model performance. 4) Analyze cases where AUST performs worse than baselines to identify potential pitfalls in adversarial uncertainty estimation, leading to a paper on the challenges and limitations of this approach."
