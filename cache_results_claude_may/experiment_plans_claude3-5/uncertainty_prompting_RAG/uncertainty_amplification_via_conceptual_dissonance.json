    "idea_name": "Uncertainty Amplification via Conceptual Dissonance",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when dealing with conceptually ambiguous or contradictory information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence estimation or ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "By intentionally introducing conceptual dissonance in prompts, we can amplify the model's inherent uncertainty and make it more apparent in the output.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting technique: 1) Generate an initial response to a query. 2) Introduce conceptual dissonance by prompting the model to consider contradictory viewpoints or information related to the query. The model is then asked to re-evaluate its initial response and provide a revised answer with an explicit uncertainty rating. The prompt includes instructions like 'Consider these conflicting perspectives: [dissonant information]. How does this affect your confidence in your initial answer? Provide a revised response with an uncertainty rating from 0-100%.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare this method against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification techniques on tasks involving ambiguous or controversial topics. Evaluate using calibration metrics and human judgments of uncertainty appropriateness."

        "Title": "Dissonance-Amplified Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when dealing with conceptually ambiguous or contradictory information. This issue is particularly pronounced in scenarios involving complex or controversial topics, where the model's confidence may not align with its actual knowledge or the inherent ambiguity of the subject matter.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence estimation or ensemble methods, which may not fully capture the nuances of conceptual ambiguity. By intentionally introducing conceptual dissonance in prompts, we can amplify the model's inherent uncertainty and make it more apparent in the output. This approach leverages the model's ability to process conflicting information and could lead to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting technique called Dissonance-Amplified Uncertainty Quantification (DAUQ):\n1. Generate an initial response to a query.\n2. Introduce conceptual dissonance by prompting the model to consider contradictory viewpoints or information related to the query. The model is then asked to re-evaluate its initial response and provide a revised answer with an explicit uncertainty rating.\n\nThe prompt for the second stage includes instructions like: 'Consider these conflicting perspectives: [dissonant information]. How does this affect your confidence in your initial answer? Provide a revised response with an uncertainty rating from 0-100%.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of 200 questions covering ambiguous or controversial topics from various domains such as science, history, politics, and ethics. Ensure a mix of questions with varying levels of inherent ambiguity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\na) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score.\nb) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses using different prompts and calculate the variance in the answers as a measure of uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: DAUQ Implementation": "For each question in the dataset:\na) Generate an initial response using a standard prompt.\nb) Create a dissonance prompt by identifying key concepts in the initial response and finding contradictory information or perspectives.\nc) Use the dissonance prompt to generate a revised response with an uncertainty rating.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics:\na) Calibration error: Compare model uncertainty ratings with human-annotated ground truth uncertainty scores.\nb) Spearman's rank correlation: Measure the correlation between model uncertainty ratings and human judgments of question ambiguity.\nc) Qualitative analysis: Manually review a subset of responses to assess the quality and coherence of uncertainty justifications.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 5 domain experts to rate the appropriateness of uncertainty estimates for a subset of 50 questions from the dataset.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run all methods (baselines and DAUQ) on the full dataset using both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo.",
            "Step 8: Results Analysis": "Compare the performance of DAUQ against the baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze how the introduction of dissonance affects uncertainty estimates across different types of questions and domains.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the DAUQ method:\na) Vary the amount of dissonant information provided.\nb) Experiment with different phrasings for the dissonance prompt.\nc) Test the effect of providing multiple rounds of dissonance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Question": "Is nuclear energy a safe and sustainable solution for climate change?",
                "Direct Prompting Input": "Is nuclear energy a safe and sustainable solution for climate change? Provide an answer and a confidence score from 0-100%.",
                "Direct Prompting Output": "Yes, nuclear energy is a safe and sustainable solution for climate change. It produces minimal greenhouse gas emissions during operation and can provide reliable baseload power. Modern nuclear plants have advanced safety features. Confidence score: 85%",
                "Ensemble Method Input": "Generate 5 different perspectives on whether nuclear energy is a safe and sustainable solution for climate change.",
                "Ensemble Method Output": "[5 different perspectives with slight variations, mostly positive, leading to a low uncertainty estimate]",
                "Explanation": "Both baseline methods fail to capture the full complexity and controversy surrounding nuclear energy, resulting in overconfident and potentially biased responses."
            },
            "Example 2 (DAUQ Success)": {
                "Question": "Is nuclear energy a safe and sustainable solution for climate change?",
                "Initial Response Prompt": "Is nuclear energy a safe and sustainable solution for climate change?",
                "Initial Response": "Nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy source that can provide reliable baseload power, making it a potential solution for climate change. It has a good safety record in many countries and modern reactors have advanced safety features.",
                "Dissonance Prompt": "Consider these conflicting perspectives: 1) Nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have had devastating long-term impacts. 2) The problem of long-term nuclear waste storage remains unsolved. 3) The high costs and long construction times of nuclear plants may make them less economically viable than rapidly improving renewable technologies. How does this affect your confidence in your initial answer? Provide a revised response with an uncertainty rating from 0-100%.",
                "Final Response": "After considering the conflicting perspectives, I would revise my response on nuclear energy as a safe and sustainable solution for climate change. While nuclear energy does offer low-carbon electricity generation and can provide reliable baseload power, there are significant concerns that complicate its role in addressing climate change.\n\nSafety: Although modern reactors have improved safety features, the potential for catastrophic accidents, as seen in Chernobyl and Fukushima, cannot be completely eliminated. These events have long-lasting environmental and social impacts.\n\nWaste management: The unresolved issue of long-term storage for highly radioactive waste poses environmental and security risks that extend far into the future.\n\nEconomic viability: High construction costs and long build times for nuclear plants may make them less competitive compared to increasingly efficient and cheaper renewable energy technologies.\n\nSustainability: While nuclear power itself produces low emissions, the mining and processing of uranium fuel have environmental impacts.\n\nGiven these complex trade-offs, nuclear energy's role in addressing climate change is not straightforward. It may be part of the solution in some contexts, but it's not a clear-cut, universally applicable answer.\n\nUncertainty rating: 70%\n\nThis high uncertainty reflects the genuine debate among experts, the context-dependent nature of energy solutions, and the need to balance multiple factors including safety, economics, and long-term sustainability.",
                "Explanation": "DAUQ successfully captures the complexity of the nuclear energy debate by introducing conflicting perspectives. The revised response acknowledges both potential benefits and significant concerns, leading to a more nuanced and appropriately uncertain stance."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DAUQ method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the types of questions or domains where DAUQ performs well or poorly, which could provide insights into the strengths and limitations of the method.\n2. Investigate how different models (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5) respond to dissonance prompts, potentially revealing interesting differences in their reasoning capabilities.\n3. Explore variations of the DAUQ method, such as iterative dissonance introduction or combining DAUQ with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why DAUQ might fail in certain cases, which could inform the development of more robust uncertainty quantification methods.\n5. Shift focus to analyzing how the introduction of dissonance affects the model's reasoning process, potentially turning the project into a study on LLM behavior under conflicting information."
