        "Problem": "Large language models often provide responses with inconsistent levels of precision, leading to overconfidence in some areas and underconfidence in others.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on global confidence calibration or post-hoc uncertainty estimation, without addressing precision at the statement level.",

        "Title": "Iterative Precision Tuning: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide responses with inconsistent levels of precision, leading to overconfidence in some areas and underconfidence in others. This inconsistency makes it challenging to accurately quantify uncertainty or calibrate confidence in model outputs, which is crucial for reliable decision-making in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically focus on global confidence calibration or post-hoc uncertainty estimation, without addressing precision at the statement level. By iteratively refining the precision of individual statements within a response, we can achieve more granular and accurate uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to assess and adjust its confidence, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Iterative Precision Tuning (IPT), a prompting technique that guides the model to progressively refine its statements' precision. The process involves five steps: 1) Initial Response: Generate an initial answer to the query. 2) Precision Analysis: Prompt the model to identify statements in its response that could be more or less precise. 3) Confidence Assessment: For each statement, ask the model to estimate its confidence at different levels of precision. 4) Precision Adjustment: Guide the model to reformulate statements, increasing or decreasing precision based on confidence. 5) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 until a desired level of overall confidence is achieved or no further adjustments are possible.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of datasets that require varying levels of precision: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ScienceQA for scientific knowledge. These datasets cover a range of domains where precision is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and 3) Self-consistency sampling. For each baseline, we'll use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to generate responses to the questions in our datasets.",
            "Step 3: IPT Implementation": "Implement the Iterative Precision Tuning method using the following prompts for each step: 1) Initial Response: \"Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]\". 2) Precision Analysis: \"Identify statements in your previous response that could be more or less precise. List them.\". 3) Confidence Assessment: \"For each statement identified, estimate your confidence at three levels of precision: high, medium, and low. Provide these estimates.\". 4) Precision Adjustment: \"Reformulate each statement to the level of precision where your confidence is highest, based on your previous estimates.\". 5) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 with the prompt \"Analyze the precision of the updated response and make further adjustments if necessary.\"",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of IPT compared to baselines: 1) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. 2) Calibration Error: Calculate the difference between the model's confidence and its actual accuracy. 3) Semantic Precision Score: Develop a rubric to score the precision of statements on a scale from 1-5. 4) Human Evaluation: Recruit domain experts to rate the appropriateness and helpfulness of the model's precision levels.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: 1) Generate responses using all baseline methods and IPT. 2) For IPT, record intermediate steps and final output. 3) Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method. 4) Repeat the process for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of IPT against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze how the number of iterations in IPT affects performance. 3) Investigate patterns in which types of statements tend to be adjusted for precision. 4) Examine differences in performance between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "1) Test IPT without the confidence assessment step to evaluate its importance. 2) Experiment with different prompts for each step of IPT to assess sensitivity to prompt wording. 3) Try varying the number of precision levels (e.g., 2, 5) in the confidence assessment step."

            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: What is the population of New York City?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The population of New York City is approximately 8.4 million people.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPT Step 1: Initial Response)": "Please answer the following question: What is the population of New York City?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPT Step 1: Initial Response)": "The population of New York City is approximately 8.4 million people as of 2021.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPT Step 2: Precision Analysis)": "Identify statements in your previous response that could be more or less precise. List them.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPT Step 2: Precision Analysis)": "1. \"approximately 8.4 million people\"\n2. \"as of 2021\"",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPT Step 3: Confidence Assessment)": "For each statement identified, estimate your confidence at three levels of precision: high, medium, and low. Provide these estimates.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPT Step 3: Confidence Assessment)": "1. \"approximately 8.4 million people\":\n   High precision (8,419,316): Low confidence\n   Medium precision (8.4 million): High confidence\n   Low precision (over 8 million): Very high confidence\n2. \"as of 2021\":\n   High precision (as of July 1, 2021): Medium confidence\n   Medium precision (in 2021): High confidence\n   Low precision (in recent years): Very high confidence",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPT Step 4: Precision Adjustment)": "Reformulate each statement to the level of precision where your confidence is highest, based on your previous estimates.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPT Step 4: Precision Adjustment)": "The population of New York City is over 8 million people in recent years.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPT Step 5: Iteration)": "Analyze the precision of the updated response and make further adjustments if necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPT Step 5: Iteration)": "The current response balances precision and confidence well. No further adjustments are necessary as increasing precision would lower confidence, while decreasing precision further would not provide meaningful information.",
            "explanation": "IPT allows the model to iteratively refine its response, adjusting the precision of statements based on its confidence levels. This process results in a more calibrated final answer compared to the baseline, which provided a precise figure without expressing uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If IPT does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification or confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why IPT fails, examining patterns in the types of questions or domains where it underperforms. This could provide insights into the limitations of self-reflection in LLMs. 2) Explore combining IPT with external knowledge sources or fact-checking mechanisms to create a hybrid approach that leverages both model-based and retrieval-based methods for improving precision and confidence. 3) Investigate whether IPT can be used as a data generation technique to create training examples for fine-tuning models on uncertainty quantification tasks. 4) Extend the study to compare IPT across a wider range of model sizes and architectures to understand how model capacity affects the ability to self-calibrate precision and confidence."
