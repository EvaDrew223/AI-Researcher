        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Debate Simulation for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often fail to consider multiple viewpoints when assessing their confidence, leading to overconfidence in complex or controversial topics. This problem is particularly acute when dealing with nuanced or contentious issues where multiple valid perspectives exist.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-perspective confidence elicitation or basic ensemble techniques. These approaches often fail to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty, especially in complex domains. Inspired by the practice of academic debate and peer review, we propose a method that simulates a multi-perspective debate to uncover and quantify uncertainty. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to generate diverse viewpoints and engage in reasoned discourse, potentially leading to more robust uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We design a structured prompting protocol with the following steps: 1) Initial response generation: The LLM generates an initial answer to the given question. 2) Perspective generation: The LLM is prompted to generate multiple distinct perspectives or 'experts' on the topic. 3) Debate simulation: We orchestrate a back-and-forth dialogue between these perspectives, each critiquing and refining the original answer. 4) Consensus building: The perspectives are prompted to collaboratively identify points of agreement and disagreement. 5) Uncertainty quantification: We analyze the degree of consensus and the strength of opposing arguments to derive an uncertainty score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets that cover controversial and nuanced topics. We will use a combination of questions from the following sources: a) Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset for complex reasoning tasks, b) ProCon.org for controversial topics, and c) AmbigQA dataset for ambiguous questions. Select 100 questions that span various domains and levels of controversy.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods for comparison: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100%). b) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses using different temperature settings and calculate the variance in the answers as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Multi-Perspective Debate Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response: Prompt the LLM to answer the question. b) Perspective generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 3-5 distinct expert perspectives on the topic. c) Debate simulation: For each perspective, generate a critique of the initial answer, then allow other perspectives to respond. Repeat for 2-3 rounds. d) Consensus building: Prompt the LLM to summarize points of agreement and disagreement among the perspectives. e) Uncertainty quantification: Develop a scoring system based on the degree of consensus and the strength of opposing arguments.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design and refine prompts for each step of the multi-perspective debate method. Example prompts: a) Perspective generation: \"Generate 3 distinct expert perspectives on [TOPIC]. Each expert should have a unique background and viewpoint.\" b) Debate simulation: \"As [EXPERT], critique the following answer: [INITIAL_ANSWER]. Provide specific points of disagreement or areas of uncertainty.\" c) Consensus building: \"Summarize the main points of agreement and disagreement among the expert perspectives discussed above.\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test the method on GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration score: Compare the model's uncertainty estimates with human expert ratings. b) Uncertainty resolution: Measure how often higher uncertainty scores correlate with actual errors or disagreements. c) Diversity of perspectives: Quantify the semantic diversity of generated expert viewpoints. d) Qualitative analysis: Manually review a subset of debate simulations for coherence and relevance.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run the baseline methods and the proposed multi-perspective debate method on the curated dataset using both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. Collect results for all evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 8: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare the performance of the proposed method against the baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the results to determine if the multi-perspective debate approach leads to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more comprehensive consideration of different viewpoints.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the method: a) Vary the number of expert perspectives generated. b) Adjust the number of debate rounds. c) Test alternative consensus-building prompts.",
            "Step 10: Error Analysis": "Perform a detailed error analysis on cases where the multi-perspective debate method fails to improve uncertainty estimation. Identify patterns or types of questions that are particularly challenging for the method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Does violent video game exposure lead to increased aggression in children? Please provide an answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: Yes, violent video game exposure can lead to increased aggression in children. Numerous studies have shown a correlation between playing violent video games and short-term increases in aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. However, the long-term effects and the strength of this relationship are still debated in the scientific community. Confidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Does violent video game exposure lead to increased aggression in children?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: There is evidence suggesting that exposure to violent video games can lead to increased aggression in children, but the relationship is complex and not fully understood. Some studies have found short-term increases in aggressive thoughts and behaviors after playing violent video games, while others have found no significant long-term effects. The impact may vary depending on individual factors, family environment, and other contextual elements.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 2: Perspective Generation)": "Generate 3 distinct expert perspectives on the relationship between violent video game exposure and aggression in children. Each expert should have a unique background and viewpoint.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 2: Perspective Generation)": "1. Dr. Emily Chen (Developmental Psychologist): Believes there is a significant link between violent video game exposure and increased aggression in children, based on numerous controlled studies showing short-term effects on aggressive thoughts and behaviors.\n2. Prof. Mark Johnson (Media Studies Researcher): Argues that the relationship between video game violence and real-world aggression is overstated, pointing to the lack of conclusive long-term studies and the failure to account for other factors influencing aggression.\n3. Dr. Sarah Thompson (Neuroscientist): Takes a nuanced view, suggesting that violent video games may affect brain development and emotional regulation in some children, but the effects are highly dependent on individual differences and environmental factors.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 3: Debate Simulation)": "As Dr. Emily Chen, critique the following answer: [INITIAL_ANSWER]. Provide specific points of disagreement or areas of uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 3: Debate Simulation)": "As Dr. Emily Chen, I would argue that the initial response understates the strength of the evidence linking violent video game exposure to increased aggression in children. While it's true that the relationship is complex, numerous meta-analyses have consistently shown a significant correlation between violent video game play and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The American Psychological Association has stated that there is sufficient evidence to establish a link. Additionally, longitudinal studies have demonstrated long-term effects, contrary to the claim that only short-term effects have been observed. However, I agree that individual and contextual factors play a role, which is why more research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms and moderating factors involved in this relationship.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 4: Consensus Building)": "Summarize the main points of agreement and disagreement among the expert perspectives discussed above regarding the relationship between violent video game exposure and aggression in children.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 4: Consensus Building)": "Points of Agreement:\n1. The relationship between violent video game exposure and aggression in children is complex and multifaceted.\n2. Short-term effects on aggressive thoughts and behaviors have been observed in some studies.\n3. Individual differences and environmental factors play a role in mediating the effects of violent video game exposure.\n\nPoints of Disagreement:\n1. The strength and consistency of the evidence linking violent video games to aggression.\n2. The existence and significance of long-term effects on aggressive behavior.\n3. The relative importance of video game violence compared to other factors influencing aggression.\n4. The interpretation and generalizability of existing research findings.\n\nAreas of Uncertainty:\n1. The specific neurological mechanisms through which violent video games might influence aggression.\n2. The effectiveness of potential interventions to mitigate any negative effects of violent video game exposure.\n3. The interaction between violent video game exposure and other risk factors for aggressive behavior.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 5: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Based on the debate and consensus summary, provide an uncertainty score (0-100%) for the claim 'Violent video game exposure leads to increased aggression in children.' Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Debate; Step 5: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Uncertainty Score: 60%\n\nReasoning: The uncertainty score of 60% reflects the significant debate and remaining questions surrounding the relationship between violent video game exposure and aggression in children. While there is agreement on the existence of short-term effects and the complex nature of the relationship, experts disagree on the strength of the evidence, the significance of long-term effects, and the relative importance of video game violence compared to other factors. The score also accounts for the acknowledged areas of uncertainty, such as the specific neurological mechanisms involved and the effectiveness of potential interventions. This moderate level of uncertainty suggests that while there is evidence supporting a link, more research is needed to fully understand the nature and extent of the relationship, as well as the contextual factors that influence it.",
            "explanation": "The multi-perspective debate approach provides a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the uncertainty surrounding the question. By simulating a debate among experts with different viewpoints, it uncovers various aspects of the issue that might be overlooked in a single-perspective response. The final uncertainty quantification takes into account both the points of agreement and disagreement, as well as explicitly acknowledged areas of uncertainty, leading to a more robust and justifiable uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-perspective debate method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of the generated debates to understand why they fail to capture uncertainty effectively. This could involve examining the diversity and quality of the generated perspectives, the coherence of the simulated debates, and the relevance of the points raised to the original question. We might discover that the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a focused application of the technique. Alternatively, we could explore hybrid approaches that combine our method with existing uncertainty quantification techniques, such as using the debate outputs to inform ensemble-based methods or to calibrate direct confidence estimates. Another direction could be to use the debate outputs as training data for a supervised model that predicts uncertainty, potentially capturing subtle patterns that our rule-based scoring system misses. Finally, if the method proves more valuable for generating comprehensive analyses rather than quantifying uncertainty, we could refocus the project on using multi-perspective debates as a tool for enhancing the depth and breadth of LLM-generated content on complex topics."
