    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often struggle to accurately assess their uncertainty when approaching problems from a single perspective, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in complex scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on a single perspective or simple ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to approach a problem from multiple distinct perspectives and triangulating the results, we can obtain a more robust and nuanced estimate of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Uncertainty Triangulation, a prompting technique that guides the model to analyze a problem from various viewpoints. The prompt includes instructions like 'Approach this problem from the perspective of: 1) a skeptic, 2) an optimist, 3) a domain expert, 4) a novice.' For each perspective, the model provides an answer and a confidence score. The method then triangulates these scores, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from a weighted combination of these perspectives, with weights determined by the coherence and justification of each viewpoint. The prompt also encourages the model to reflect on discrepancies between perspectives, providing valuable insights into the sources of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on a range of tasks including ethical dilemmas, scientific reasoning, and open-ended prediction problems. Compare against single-perspective methods and simple ensemble techniques. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration plots, sharpness, and resolution, as well as qualitative analysis of the multi-perspective insights generated."

        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Uncertainty Triangulation: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their uncertainty when approaching problems from a single perspective, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in complex scenarios. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks involving ethical dilemmas, scientific reasoning, and open-ended prediction problems.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on a single perspective or simple ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation, which can be limiting. By prompting the model to approach a problem from multiple distinct perspectives and triangulating the results, we can obtain a more robust and nuanced estimate of uncertainty. This method leverages the model's ability to reason from different viewpoints, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence scores and more insightful uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Uncertainty Triangulation (MPUT), a prompting technique that guides the model to analyze a problem from various viewpoints. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Prompt the model to approach the problem from multiple perspectives (e.g., skeptic, optimist, domain expert, novice). 2) For each perspective, obtain an answer and a confidence score. 3) Triangulate these scores, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. 4) Derive the final uncertainty estimate from a weighted combination of these perspectives, with weights determined by the coherence and justification of each viewpoint. 5) Prompt the model to reflect on discrepancies between perspectives, providing insights into the sources of uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets covering ethical dilemmas (e.g., Moral Scenarios dataset), scientific reasoning (e.g., SciQ), and open-ended prediction problems (e.g., ForecastQA). Aim for 100-200 questions per category.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct prompting (single perspective), b) Ensemble method (average of multiple independent runs), c) Temperature scaling for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: MPUT Implementation": "Develop prompts for each perspective (skeptic, optimist, domain expert, novice). Create a pipeline to generate answers and confidence scores from each perspective, triangulate the results, and produce a final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their outputs and uncertainty estimates. b) Apply MPUT and record the outputs from each perspective, the triangulated result, and the final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: a) Calibration plots (comparing predicted probabilities vs. observed frequencies), b) Brier score (for binary questions), c) Continuous Ranked Probability Score (for open-ended predictions), d) Qualitative analysis of multi-perspective insights.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare MPUT against baselines across different question types. Analyze how often MPUT leads to better calibrated uncertainties and more insightful explanations of uncertainty sources."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Will quantum computers be commercially available for general-purpose computing by 2030? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: Yes, quantum computers will likely be commercially available for general-purpose computing by 2030. Confidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: Will quantum computers be commercially available for general-purpose computing by 2030? Please approach this question from the following perspectives: 1) A skeptical computer scientist, 2) An optimistic quantum physicist, 3) A cautious industry analyst, 4) A novice technology enthusiast. For each perspective, provide an answer and a confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1) Skeptical computer scientist: Answer: No, quantum computers will not be commercially available for general-purpose computing by 2030. There are still significant technical challenges to overcome, including error correction and scalability issues. Confidence: 70%\n\n2) Optimistic quantum physicist: Answer: Yes, quantum computers will be commercially available for general-purpose computing by 2030. Recent breakthroughs in qubit coherence and quantum error correction are very promising. Confidence: 80%\n\n3) Cautious industry analyst: Answer: It's possible, but not certain that quantum computers will be commercially available for general-purpose computing by 2030. While progress is being made, there are still significant hurdles in terms of cost, reliability, and practical applications. Confidence: 50%\n\n4) Novice technology enthusiast: Answer: Yes, quantum computers will definitely be available by 2030! The pace of technological advancement is so rapid, and there's so much investment in this field. Confidence: 90%\n\nTriangulated result: The availability of commercial quantum computers for general-purpose computing by 2030 is uncertain, with a slight lean towards 'yes'. The confidence levels vary significantly across perspectives, indicating high uncertainty. The main sources of uncertainty are the technical challenges highlighted by the skeptical view versus the recent breakthroughs and rapid progress emphasized by the optimistic view. The industry analyst's perspective suggests that practical and economic factors also contribute to the uncertainty. Final confidence: 60% \u00b1 15%",
            "Explanation": "The MPUT method provides a more nuanced view of the uncertainty surrounding the question. It captures different aspects of the problem (technical challenges, recent progress, industry factors) and explicitly shows the variation in confidence across perspectives. This leads to a more calibrated final confidence estimate and provides insights into the sources of uncertainty, which are not present in the baseline output."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MPUT doesn't significantly improve calibration or provide more insightful uncertainty estimates, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze why certain perspectives are more or less calibrated, potentially leading to insights about biases in different viewpoints. 2) Investigate how the number and types of perspectives affect the final uncertainty estimate, which could inform an optimal set of perspectives for different question types. 3) Explore using MPUT as a data augmentation technique for fine-tuning smaller models on uncertainty estimation. 4) Develop a method to automatically generate relevant perspectives for any given question, potentially improving the generalizability of the approach."
