        "Problem": "Current LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid paths of thought exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods typically focus on model-level uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by human problem-solving, where we often consider multiple approaches before settling on a solution, we propose exploring divergent reasoning paths to better gauge model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Path Exploration (DPE), a prompting method that encourages the LLM to generate multiple distinct reasoning paths for a given problem. The prompt structure is as follows: 1) Present the problem. 2) Ask the model to generate N different reasoning approaches (e.g., 'Generate 5 distinct ways to approach this problem.'). 3) For each approach, ask the model to follow through and generate a solution. 4) Finally, prompt the model to analyze the consistency and plausibility of the different solutions, and to provide a confidence score based on this analysis. The confidence score is derived from the agreement between paths and the model's assessment of each path's validity.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare DPE against standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting on reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH. Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, calibration error, and correlation between confidence scores and correctness."

        "Title": "Divergent Path Exploration: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Path Reasoning",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid paths of thought exist. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions in ambiguous situations, potentially resulting in unreliable or misleading outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods typically focus on model-level uncertainty estimation, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties inherent in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by human problem-solving, where we often consider multiple approaches before settling on a solution, we propose exploring divergent reasoning paths to better gauge model uncertainty. This method leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to generate and analyze multiple solution paths, potentially providing a more accurate and interpretable measure of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Path Exploration (DPE), a prompting method that encourages the LLM to generate multiple distinct reasoning paths for a given problem. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Present the problem. 2) Ask the model to generate N different reasoning approaches (e.g., 'Generate 5 distinct ways to approach this problem.'). 3) For each approach, ask the model to follow through and generate a solution. 4) Finally, prompt the model to analyze the consistency and plausibility of the different solutions, and to provide a confidence score based on this analysis. The confidence score is derived from the agreement between paths and the model's assessment of each path's validity.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets provide a diverse range of problems that require multi-step reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly asking the model to solve the problem. 2) Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: asking the model to show its work step-by-step.",
            "Step 3: DPE Implementation": "Implement the Divergent Path Exploration method with the following steps for each problem: a) Present the problem. b) Generate N=5 distinct reasoning approaches. c) For each approach, generate a solution. d) Analyze the solutions and provide a confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the datasets: a) Apply standard prompting. b) Apply CoT prompting. c) Apply DPE method. d) Record the final answers, intermediate steps (for CoT and DPE), and confidence scores (for DPE).",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: percentage of correct final answers. b) Calibration error: difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. c) Correlation: between confidence scores and correctness of answers.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis, including: a) Comparison of accuracy across methods. b) Analysis of calibration error and correlation for DPE. c) Qualitative analysis of generated reasoning paths and their diversity. d) Investigation of cases where DPE significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Problem": "A store is offering a 15% discount on all items. If an item originally costs $80, what is the final price after the discount?",
                "Standard Prompt Input": "A store is offering a 15% discount on all items. If an item originally costs $80, what is the final price after the discount?",
                "Standard Prompt Output": "The final price after the 15% discount would be $68. To calculate this, we first find 15% of $80, which is $12 (0.15 * $80 = $12). Then we subtract this from the original price: $80 - $12 = $68.",
                "CoT Prompt Input": "A store is offering a 15% discount on all items. If an item originally costs $80, what is the final price after the discount? Let's approach this step-by-step.",
                "CoT Prompt Output": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. The original price of the item is $80.\n2. The discount is 15% of the original price.\n3. To calculate the discount amount: 15% of $80 = 0.15 * $80 = $12\n4. To find the final price, we subtract the discount from the original price:\n   $80 - $12 = $68\nTherefore, the final price after the 15% discount is $68.",
                "Explanation": "Both standard prompting and CoT prompting provide a single solution path, which happens to be correct in this case. However, they don't provide any measure of the model's confidence or explore alternative approaches."
            },
            "Example 2 (DPE Success)": {
                "Problem": "A store is offering a 15% discount on all items. If an item originally costs $80, what is the final price after the discount?",
                "DPE Prompt Input": "A store is offering a 15% discount on all items. If an item originally costs $80, what is the final price after the discount? Generate 5 distinct ways to approach this problem.",
                "DPE Prompt Output": "Here are 5 distinct approaches to solve this problem:\n\n1. Percentage Reduction Approach:\n   - Calculate 15% of $80\n   - Subtract this amount from $80\n\n2. Decimal Multiplication Approach:\n   - Convert 15% to 0.15\n   - Multiply $80 by (1 - 0.15)\n\n3. Fraction Approach:\n   - Express 15% as 15/100\n   - Multiply $80 by (1 - 15/100)\n\n4. Ratio Approach:\n   - Set up a ratio: 85:100 = x:80\n   - Solve for x\n\n5. Reverse Percentage Approach:\n   - Consider the final price as 85% of the original\n   - Calculate 85% of $80\n\nNow, let's solve using each approach:\n\n1. Percentage Reduction:\n   15% of $80 = 0.15 * $80 = $12\n   $80 - $12 = $68\n\n2. Decimal Multiplication:\n   $80 * (1 - 0.15) = $80 * 0.85 = $68\n\n3. Fraction:\n   $80 * (1 - 15/100) = $80 * (85/100) = $68\n\n4. Ratio:\n   85:100 = x:80\n   85x = 8000\n   x = 8000/85 = $68 (rounded to nearest cent)\n\n5. Reverse Percentage:\n   85% of $80 = 0.85 * $80 = $68\n\nAnalysis:\nAll five approaches yield the same result of $68. This consistency across different methods increases our confidence in the answer. Each method is mathematically sound and approaches the problem from a different angle, providing a robust verification of the result.\n\nConfidence Score: 95%\n\nExplanation of Confidence Score:\nThe high confidence score of 95% is based on the following factors:\n1. All five distinct approaches produced the same result.\n2. The methods used are all mathematically valid and commonly accepted for discount calculations.\n3. The calculations are straightforward with little room for computational errors.\n4. The approaches cover a wide range of mathematical concepts (percentages, decimals, fractions, ratios), all leading to the same conclusion.\n\nThe 5% uncertainty accounts for potential human error in the problem statement or extremely unlikely calculation errors across all methods. In real-world scenarios, it's prudent to leave a small margin for uncertainty.",
                "Explanation": "DPE generates multiple solution paths, providing a more comprehensive analysis of the problem. By exploring different approaches and comparing their results, the model can better assess its confidence in the answer. This method also demonstrates the model's ability to approach the problem from various mathematical perspectives, potentially uncovering insights that a single-path approach might miss."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Divergent Path Exploration method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification or calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why DPE fails to capture uncertainty effectively. This might involve categorizing the types of problems where DPE underperforms and analyzing the generated reasoning paths for these cases. We could also investigate whether the number of generated paths (N) affects performance, potentially revealing an optimal number of paths for different problem types. Additionally, we could explore alternative methods for combining the multiple reasoning paths, such as weighted averaging based on the model's assessment of each path's validity. Another direction could be to combine DPE with other uncertainty quantification methods, like ensemble techniques or Monte Carlo dropout, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could shift focus to analyze how DPE affects the interpretability and explainability of the model's reasoning process, even if it doesn't directly improve uncertainty quantification. This could lead to insights about the model's reasoning capabilities and limitations, potentially informing future research on improving LLM reasoning and uncertainty estimation."
