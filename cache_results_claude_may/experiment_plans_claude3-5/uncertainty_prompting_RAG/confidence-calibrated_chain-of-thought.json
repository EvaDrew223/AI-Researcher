        "Problem": "While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it doesn't inherently provide calibrated uncertainty estimates for each step or the final conclusion.",
        "Existing Methods": "Standard CoT focuses on improving reasoning without explicit uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "Integrating fine-grained confidence calibration into the CoT process could provide more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates for complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Chain-of-Thought (CC-CoT), an extension of CoT that incorporates uncertainty quantification at each reasoning step. The prompting process guides the model to: 1) Begin a standard CoT reasoning process. 2) After each logical step, pause to: a) Assign a confidence score (0-100) to that specific step. b) Identify the main source of uncertainty for that step. c) Suggest an alternative path if confidence is low. 3) Before stating the final answer, review the confidence scores of all steps. 4) Provide a final answer along with an overall confidence score, explaining how it relates to the step-wise confidence assessments. 5) Identify the weakest links in the reasoning chain and suggest focused areas for verification or improvement.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CC-CoT against standard CoT and other uncertainty quantification methods on multi-step reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems, logical deductions). Analyze the correlation between step-wise confidence scores and correctness of individual reasoning steps. Assess the overall calibration of final confidence scores and the informativeness of uncertainty breakdowns."

        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Chain-of-Thought (CC-CoT): Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models, it lacks inherent mechanisms for providing calibrated uncertainty estimates for each reasoning step and the final conclusion. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of complex reasoning tasks performed by these models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like standard CoT focus primarily on improving reasoning without explicit uncertainty quantification. By integrating fine-grained confidence calibration into the CoT process, we can potentially provide more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates for complex reasoning tasks. This approach could significantly enhance the trustworthiness and applicability of LLMs in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Chain-of-Thought (CC-CoT), an extension of CoT that incorporates uncertainty quantification at each reasoning step. The prompting process guides the model to: 1) Begin a standard CoT reasoning process. 2) After each logical step, pause to: a) Assign a confidence score (0-100) to that specific step. b) Identify the main source of uncertainty for that step. c) Suggest an alternative path if confidence is low. 3) Before stating the final answer, review the confidence scores of all steps. 4) Provide a final answer along with an overall confidence score, explaining how it relates to the step-wise confidence assessments. 5) Identify the weakest links in the reasoning chain and suggest focused areas for verification or improvement.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) GSM8K for math word problems, 2) LogiQA for logical reasoning, and 3) MMLU for multi-task language understanding. These datasets cover a range of reasoning tasks and will help evaluate the effectiveness of CC-CoT across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible for research purposes.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Zero-shot (direct prompting), 2) Few-shot prompting, and 3) Standard Chain-of-Thought prompting. For each baseline, we'll use the same prompts across all datasets to ensure consistency.",
            "Step 4: CC-CoT Implementation": "Develop the CC-CoT prompting strategy. The prompt will include instructions for the model to follow the CC-CoT process, including confidence scoring, uncertainty identification, and alternative path suggestion for each step.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the three baseline methods. b) Run the CC-CoT method. c) Collect model outputs, including intermediate steps, confidence scores, and final answers.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of final answers. 2) Calibration Error: Compare model-assigned confidence scores with actual performance. 3) Uncertainty Correlation: Analyze the correlation between step-wise confidence scores and correctness of individual reasoning steps. 4) Alternative Path Quality: Assess the relevance and correctness of suggested alternative paths for low-confidence steps.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform comparative analysis between CC-CoT and baselines: 1) Compare overall accuracy across methods. 2) Analyze calibration improvements of CC-CoT over standard CoT. 3) Evaluate the informativeness of uncertainty breakdowns in CC-CoT. 4) Assess the quality and usefulness of suggested alternative paths in CC-CoT.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of CC-CoT: 1) Remove confidence scoring. 2) Remove uncertainty source identification. 3) Remove alternative path suggestion. This will help identify which components contribute most to the method's effectiveness."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard CoT)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does John have now? Let's approach this step by step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard CoT)": "1. Initial number of apples: John starts with 5 apples.\n2. Apples given away: John gives 2 apples to his friend.\n   5 - 2 = 3 apples remaining\n3. Apples bought: John buys 3 more apples.\n   3 + 3 = 6 apples\nTherefore, John now has 6 apples.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CC-CoT)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does John have now? Let's approach this step by step, assigning a confidence score (0-100) to each step, identifying sources of uncertainty, and suggesting alternatives for low-confidence steps:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CC-CoT)": "1. Initial number of apples: John starts with 5 apples.\n   Confidence: 100\n   Uncertainty: None\n   Alternative: N/A\n\n2. Apples given away: John gives 2 apples to his friend.\n   5 - 2 = 3 apples remaining\n   Confidence: 95\n   Uncertainty: Minor uncertainty about the accuracy of the subtraction\n   Alternative: Double-check the subtraction\n\n3. Apples bought: John buys 3 more apples.\n   3 + 3 = 6 apples\n   Confidence: 98\n   Uncertainty: Slight uncertainty about combining previous result with new information\n   Alternative: Recheck the addition and the carry-over from previous step\n\nReview of confidence scores: All steps have high confidence (95+), suggesting a reliable reasoning process.\n\nFinal answer: John now has 6 apples.\nOverall confidence: 97\nExplanation: The high confidence in each step contributes to a high overall confidence. The slight uncertainties in steps 2 and 3 marginally reduce the overall confidence.\n\nWeakest link: Step 2 has the lowest confidence, though still high at 95. For verification, one could double-check the subtraction in this step.",
            "Explanation": "The CC-CoT output provides a more nuanced understanding of the model's reasoning process. It includes confidence scores, sources of uncertainty, and potential alternatives for each step. This additional information allows for better assessment of the reliability of the model's reasoning and highlights areas that might need verification or improvement."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CC-CoT doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why CC-CoT fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in self-assessment and uncertainty quantification. 2) Explore variations of CC-CoT, such as adjusting the granularity of confidence scoring or modifying how alternative paths are suggested. 3) Investigate how different prompting strategies affect the model's ability to provide calibrated confidence estimates. This could lead to a study on prompt engineering for improved uncertainty quantification. 4) Analyze the relationship between task difficulty and the effectiveness of CC-CoT, which could inform when such methods are most beneficial. 5) Examine how CC-CoT performs across different model sizes and architectures, potentially revealing insights about how model scale relates to self-assessment capabilities."
