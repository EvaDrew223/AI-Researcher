    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to maintain consistent confidence levels across semantically related but distinct concepts, leading to miscalibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods focus on global calibration but fail to address concept-specific confidence inconsistencies.",
        "Motivation": "By detecting and quantifying semantic drift in model responses, we can better understand how confidence levels shift across related concepts and use this information to calibrate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting approach: 1) Semantic Expansion: Given an input query, prompt the model to generate a set of semantically related concepts or questions. 2) Drift Detection: For each expanded concept, prompt the model to answer and provide a confidence score. Analyze the pattern of confidence scores across the semantic space to detect drifts. Use detected drifts to adjust the original confidence estimate. Prompt the model to explain observed drifts, providing interpretability.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on diverse datasets covering factual knowledge, common sense reasoning, and specialized domains. Compare against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and temperature scaling. Measure calibration improvements using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)."

        "Title": "Semantic Drift Detection for Calibrated Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to maintain consistent confidence levels across semantically related but distinct concepts, leading to miscalibrated uncertainty estimates. This inconsistency can result in overconfident predictions for unfamiliar or ambiguous queries, potentially leading to unreliable or misleading outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods focus on global calibration but fail to address concept-specific confidence inconsistencies. By detecting and quantifying semantic drift in model responses, we can better understand how confidence levels shift across related concepts and use this information to calibrate uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's own understanding of semantic relationships to improve its calibration, potentially offering a more nuanced and accurate representation of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting approach: 1) Semantic Expansion: Given an input query, prompt the model to generate a set of semantically related concepts or questions. 2) Drift Detection: For each expanded concept, prompt the model to answer and provide a confidence score. Analyze the pattern of confidence scores across the semantic space to detect drifts. Use detected drifts to adjust the original confidence estimate. Prompt the model to explain observed drifts, providing interpretability.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Collect diverse datasets covering factual knowledge (e.g., TriviaQA), common sense reasoning (e.g., CommonsenseQA), and specialized domains (e.g., MedQA for medical knowledge). Ensure each dataset has ground truth answers and covers a range of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement direct confidence elicitation and temperature scaling as baseline methods. For direct elicitation, prompt the model to provide an answer and confidence score. For temperature scaling, use a held-out validation set to optimize the temperature parameter.",
            "Step 3: Semantic Expansion Prompting": "Design a prompt template for semantic expansion. Example: 'Given the question \"{question}\", generate 5 semantically related questions or concepts that explore similar knowledge areas.' Apply this prompt to each question in the datasets.",
            "Step 4: Drift Detection Prompting": "For each original question and its expanded set, create a prompt that asks the model to answer and provide a confidence score. Example: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: {question}' Apply this to the original question and all expanded questions.",
            "Step 5: Drift Analysis": "Implement an algorithm to analyze the pattern of confidence scores across the semantic space. Calculate the variance and identify significant deviations from the mean confidence. Flag instances where the confidence for expanded questions differs significantly from the original.",
            "Step 6: Confidence Adjustment": "Develop a method to adjust the original confidence estimate based on detected drifts. For example, if the confidence scores for expanded questions are consistently lower, reduce the original confidence estimate.",
            "Step 7: Explanation Generation": "For cases with significant drift, prompt the model to explain the observed differences. Example: 'Explain why the confidence level might differ between the original question \"{original_question}\" and the related question \"{drifted_question}\".'",
            "Step 8: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines using calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). Also evaluate the accuracy of adjusted predictions and the quality of generated explanations.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of cases where the method significantly improved or worsened calibration. Examine patterns in semantic drift across different types of questions and knowledge domains."

                "Explanation": "The confidence in Paris as the capital is high, but there's more uncertainty about historical aspects and specific details about the city. The adjusted confidence reflects this broader context."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly improve calibration, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on patterns of semantic drift in LLM confidence. We would examine how confidence varies across different types of questions, knowledge domains, and levels of abstraction. This could involve clustering semantically related questions and analyzing confidence patterns within clusters. We could also investigate whether certain linguistic features or question structures correlate with higher or lower confidence drift. Additionally, we might explore whether the explanations generated for confidence differences provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases. This analysis could inform future approaches to improving LLM calibration and provide valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty in language models."
