    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often rely on single-pass evaluations, which may not capture the full spectrum of model confidence across different contexts and phrasings.",
        "Existing Methods": "Typical approaches include token probability analysis, ensemble methods, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence often fluctuates when considering a problem from multiple angles. By mimicking this process, we can potentially uncover a more nuanced and accurate representation of an LLM's true uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Oscillation Prompting, a multi-step process where the model is prompted to answer the same question multiple times, each with a slight variation in context or phrasing. The prompt includes instructions like \"Answer the following question. Then, rephrase the question slightly and answer again. Repeat this process 5 times.\" We then analyze the variation in responses and self-reported confidence across these iterations. The degree of oscillation in confidence and consistency of answers provides a meta-measure of uncertainty. Additionally, we prompt the model to reflect on its own oscillations: \"Considering your varying responses, what is your overall confidence in your ability to answer this question accurately?\"",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare this method against standard confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on a range of tasks including factual QA, reasoning problems, and open-ended generation. Evaluate using calibration metrics, correlation with human judgments of uncertainty, and performance on abstention tasks."

        "Title": "Confidence Oscillation Prompting: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Step Evaluation",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-pass evaluations, which may not capture the full spectrum of model confidence across different contexts and phrasings. This limitation can lead to overconfident or inconsistent responses, potentially undermining the reliability of LLMs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence often fluctuates when considering a problem from multiple angles. By mimicking this process in LLMs, we can potentially uncover a more nuanced and accurate representation of an LLM's true uncertainty. Existing methods like token probability analysis, ensemble methods, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting do not fully capture this dynamic nature of confidence. Our proposed method, Confidence Oscillation Prompting, aims to address this gap by introducing a multi-step evaluation process that more closely mirrors human cognitive processes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Oscillation Prompting, a multi-step process where the model is prompted to answer the same question multiple times, each with a slight variation in context or phrasing. The process involves the following steps: 1) Initial question presentation. 2) Model generates an answer and self-reported confidence. 3) Model rephrases the question slightly. 4) Model answers the rephrased question and reports confidence. 5) Steps 3-4 are repeated for a total of 5 iterations. 6) Model reflects on its varying responses and provides an overall confidence assessment. We then analyze the variation in responses and self-reported confidence across these iterations. The degree of oscillation in confidence and consistency of answers provides a meta-measure of uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse range of tasks including: a) Factual QA: Use TriviaQA dataset. b) Reasoning problems: Use MATH dataset. c) Open-ended generation: Use writing prompts from the WritingPrompts subreddit.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for primary experiments. Also include Claude from Anthropic as an additional model for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard confidence elicitation: Direct prompting for answer and confidence. b) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses and use their variance as a proxy for uncertainty. c) Token probability analysis: Use the model's output probabilities to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: Confidence Oscillation Prompting Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following prompt structure: 'Question: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION] Answer this question and rate your confidence from 0-100%. Then, rephrase the question slightly and answer again with a new confidence rating. Repeat this process 5 times. Finally, considering your varying responses, what is your overall confidence in your ability to answer this question accurately?' For each task, generate 5 iterations of rephrased questions, answers, and confidence ratings.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare model's reported confidence with actual accuracy. b) Confidence oscillation magnitude: Calculate the standard deviation of confidence scores across iterations. c) Answer consistency: Measure semantic similarity between answers using sentence embeddings. d) Correlation with human judgments: Recruit human annotators to rate the difficulty and ambiguity of a subset of questions, and correlate these with the model's confidence oscillation.",
            "Step 6: Abstention Task": "Implement an abstention task where the model can choose not to answer based on its confidence. Compare the performance of baseline methods and Confidence Oscillation Prompting in terms of accuracy on answered questions vs. proportion of abstentions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct the following analyses: a) Compare performance of Confidence Oscillation Prompting against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze how confidence oscillation varies across different task types. c) Investigate the relationship between confidence oscillation magnitude and task difficulty/ambiguity. d) Examine cases where Confidence Oscillation Prompting significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of: a) Number of iterations (vary from 1 to 10). b) Presence/absence of the final reflection step. c) Different phrasings for the confidence elicitation prompt."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please answer and rate your confidence from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Confidence Oscillation Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Answer this question and rate your confidence from 0-100%. Then, rephrase the question slightly and answer again with a new confidence rating. Repeat this process 5 times. Finally, considering your varying responses, what is your overall confidence in your ability to answer this question accurately?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Oscillation Prompting)": "1. The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%\n2. Which city serves as the capital of France? The capital city of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%\n3. What is the name of the French capital? Paris is the capital of France. Confidence: 100%\n4. Can you identify the capital city of France? Yes, the capital city of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%\n5. What urban center is recognized as France's capital? Paris is recognized as the capital of France. Confidence: 100%\nOverall confidence: Given the consistency of my responses and the well-known nature of this fact, my overall confidence in answering this question accurately is 100%.",
            "Explanation": "In this example, the baseline method provides a single confidence score, while the Confidence Oscillation Prompting method allows for multiple iterations and a final reflection. Even for this simple factual question, the proposed method provides more information about the model's confidence across different phrasings, potentially revealing any uncertainties that might not be apparent in a single-pass evaluation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Confidence Oscillation Prompting method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of the patterns in confidence oscillation across different task types and difficulty levels. This could provide insights into when and why LLMs exhibit uncertainty, even if it doesn't directly improve uncertainty quantification. Second, we could explore combining Confidence Oscillation Prompting with other methods, such as using it to generate inputs for ensemble methods or to refine token probability analysis. Finally, we could investigate whether the rephrasing step itself improves answer quality, turning the project into an exploration of how question reformulation impacts LLM performance and confidence. These alternative directions could still yield valuable insights into LLM behavior and uncertainty, even if the original hypothesis isn't fully supported."
