        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often focus on output-level uncertainty, neglecting the rich information available in the model's internal representations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods rely on output probabilities or ensemble techniques that don't leverage the model's internal state.",
        "Motivation": "The internal representations of LLMs contain valuable information about the model's decision-making process and uncertainty. By mapping these representations to uncertainty estimates, we can potentially capture more nuanced and accurate measures of model confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Latent Space Uncertainty Mapping (LSUM), a novel prompting technique that guides the LLM to introspect on its own internal representations. The method involves a series of carefully crafted prompts that ask the model to 'visualize' and describe its internal state when processing a given input. For example, we might prompt: 'Imagine your internal representation for this input as a landscape. Describe the terrain in detail.' or 'If your confidence was a color palette, what colors would you see for this question?'. These metaphorical descriptions are then mapped to uncertainty estimates using a learned transformation. The transformation is trained on a small set of calibrated examples, allowing it to generalize to new inputs.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate LSUM on a range of tasks including open-ended generation, fact-checking, and multi-hop reasoning. We will compare its performance against traditional uncertainty estimation methods and other prompting techniques. We will also conduct an ablation study to understand the contribution of different components of the LSUM method."

        "Title": "Latent Space Uncertainty Mapping: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Internal Representation Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often focus on output-level uncertainty, neglecting the rich information available in the model's internal representations. This approach limits our ability to accurately quantify model confidence and uncertainty, particularly in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "The internal representations of LLMs contain valuable information about the model's decision-making process and uncertainty. Traditional methods relying on output probabilities or ensemble techniques don't leverage this internal state. By mapping these representations to uncertainty estimates, we can potentially capture more nuanced and accurate measures of model confidence. This approach is inspired by how humans often introspect on their thought processes to gauge their confidence in a decision.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Latent Space Uncertainty Mapping (LSUM), a novel prompting technique that guides the LLM to introspect on its own internal representations. The method involves a series of carefully crafted prompts that ask the model to 'visualize' and describe its internal state when processing a given input. These metaphorical descriptions are then mapped to uncertainty estimates using a learned transformation. The process involves three main steps: 1) Generating metaphorical descriptions of internal states, 2) Mapping these descriptions to numerical uncertainty estimates, and 3) Calibrating the uncertainty estimates using a small set of labeled examples.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) MMLU for multi-task evaluation. Split each dataset into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Output probability, 2) Ensemble disagreement, and 3) Monte Carlo Dropout. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as the base models for all experiments.",
            "Step 3: LSUM Prompt Design": "Design a set of prompts for each task that ask the model to describe its internal state metaphorically. For example: 'Imagine your internal representation for this input as a landscape. Describe the terrain in detail.' or 'If your confidence was a color palette, what colors would you see for this question?'",
            "Step 4: Metaphor Generation": "For each input in the datasets, use the designed prompts to generate metaphorical descriptions of the model's internal state. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for this step.",
            "Step 5: Uncertainty Mapping": "Design a simple neural network that takes the generated metaphorical descriptions as input and outputs a scalar uncertainty estimate. Train this network on a small subset of the training data where we have ground truth labels for correctness.",
            "Step 6: LSUM Pipeline Implementation": "Implement the full LSUM pipeline: 1) Input processing, 2) Metaphor generation, 3) Uncertainty mapping.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate LSUM and the baselines on the test sets of all three datasets. Use metrics such as Brier score, calibration error, and AUC-ROC to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform an ablation study to understand the contribution of different components of the LSUM method. Analyze the generated metaphors to gain insights into the model's decision-making process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Confidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. Now, imagine your internal representation for this answer as a landscape. Describe the terrain in detail.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "The landscape for this answer is a vast, open plain with a prominent, towering structure at its center - clearly representing the Eiffel Tower. The plain is lush and green, symbolizing the certainty and ease with which this information is recalled. The sky above is clear and blue, indicating a high level of confidence. There are no obstacles or unclear areas in sight, suggesting a straightforward and unambiguous answer. The entire scene is bathed in bright sunlight, further emphasizing the clarity and certainty of the response.",
            "Explanation": "The LSUM method provides a rich, metaphorical description of the model's internal state, which can be mapped to a more nuanced uncertainty estimate. In contrast, the baseline method only provides a single confidence score, which may not capture the full complexity of the model's uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the LSUM method doesn't outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why metaphorical descriptions of internal states don't correlate well with uncertainty. We could investigate: 1) The consistency of generated metaphors across different inputs and models, 2) How well humans can interpret these metaphors to gauge model uncertainty, and 3) Whether certain types of metaphors (e.g., visual, auditory, emotional) are more informative for uncertainty estimation. We could also explore combining LSUM with traditional uncertainty estimation methods, using the metaphorical descriptions as additional features in a more complex uncertainty prediction model."
