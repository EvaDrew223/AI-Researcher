    "idea_name": "Confidence Calibration through Hypothetical Peer Review",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often lack external perspective when assessing their own confidence, leading to miscalibration.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current methods rely on the model's self-assessment or direct confidence elicitation.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a peer review process, we can encourage the model to take a more critical and external perspective on its own responses, leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting process: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate for the query. 2) Prompt the model to assume the role of three different expert reviewers, each critiquing the initial response from a unique perspective. 3) For each reviewer, generate potential criticisms, questions, and alternative viewpoints. 4) Prompt the original 'author' to respond to each reviewer, addressing concerns and updating the response if necessary. 5) Finally, ask the model to synthesize a final response and confidence estimate, taking into account the entire review process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test this method on a range of tasks, particularly those requiring domain expertise or critical thinking. Compare against baseline confidence elicitation methods and other multi-step prompting techniques. Evaluate using standard calibration metrics as well as qualitative analysis of the generated peer reviews and responses."

        "Title": "Peer Review Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack external perspective when assessing their own confidence, leading to miscalibration. This can result in overconfident responses for incorrect or uncertain information, potentially misleading users.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for confidence calibration in LLMs primarily rely on the model's self-assessment or direct confidence elicitation, which may not capture the nuances of uncertainty in complex tasks. By simulating a peer review process, we can encourage the model to take a more critical and external perspective on its own responses, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates. This approach leverages the model's ability to assume different roles and critique its own work, which could provide a more robust and nuanced assessment of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting process called Peer Review Prompting (PRP): 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate for the query. 2) Prompt the model to assume the role of three different expert reviewers, each critiquing the initial response from a unique perspective. 3) For each reviewer, generate potential criticisms, questions, and alternative viewpoints. 4) Prompt the original 'author' to respond to each reviewer, addressing concerns and updating the response if necessary. 5) Finally, ask the model to synthesize a final response and confidence estimate, taking into account the entire review process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks that require domain expertise or critical thinking. Datasets include: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and honesty, 2) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for domain-specific knowledge, and 3) ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement the following baselines: a) Direct prompting with confidence elicitation, b) Temperature scaling, c) Ensemble methods (e.g., using multiple model samples).",
            "Step 3: Implement Peer Review Prompting": "For each query: 1) Generate initial response and confidence. 2) Generate three reviewer perspectives. 3) Generate criticisms from each reviewer. 4) Generate author responses to criticisms. 5) Synthesize final response and confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Use standard calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. Also evaluate accuracy to ensure calibration doesn't come at the cost of performance.",
            "Step 6: Experiments": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and PRP. Vary the number of reviewers (1, 3, 5) to assess the impact on calibration.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare PRP against baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the generated peer reviews and responses qualitatively to understand the method's strengths and weaknesses.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "1) Vary the expertise level of reviewers. 2) Remove the author response step. 3) Use different prompts for reviewer generation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Generate Reviewers)": "You are now three different expert reviewers: a historian, a geographer, and a political scientist. Each of you will critique the following answer: 'The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Generate Reviewers)": "Historian: While the answer is correct, the confidence score might be slightly high. There have been periods in history where other cities served as the capital of France, such as Vichy during World War II. This historical context might warrant a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nGeographer: The answer is correct from a current geographical standpoint. However, it's worth noting that the concept of a 'capital' can sometimes be complex, as some countries have multiple capitals for different functions. In France's case, this isn't an issue, but it might be worth mentioning for completeness.\n\nPolitical Scientist: The answer is correct in terms of current political organization. However, it's important to note that the status of capital cities can change due to political decisions. While unlikely for France in the near future, this possibility exists theoretically, which might justify a marginally lower confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Author Response)": "As the original author, please respond to each reviewer's comments and consider updating your answer and confidence score if necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Author Response)": "Thank you all for your insightful comments. I appreciate the historical, geographical, and political perspectives you've provided.\n\nTo the historian: You make a valid point about Vichy's role during World War II. While this was a unique circumstance in French history, it does highlight that capital status can change.\n\nTo the geographer: Your point about the complexity of capital cities is well-taken, though as you noted, it doesn't directly apply to France's current situation.\n\nTo the political scientist: I agree that theoretically, capital status can change due to political decisions, even if it's unlikely for France in the foreseeable future.\n\nConsidering these points, I will slightly adjust my answer and confidence score:\n\nUpdated answer: The current capital of France is Paris. While this has been the case for most of modern history, it's worth noting that capital status can theoretically change due to historical events or political decisions. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on the initial answer, reviewer comments, and author response, please provide a final answer and confidence score for the question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final answer: The capital of France is Paris. This has been the case for most of modern French history and remains true today. However, it's worth acknowledging that capital status can theoretically change due to extraordinary historical circumstances or political decisions, as evidenced by brief periods in French history. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Explanation": "The Peer Review Prompting method allows for a more nuanced and well-rounded assessment of the answer and its associated confidence. By incorporating different expert perspectives and allowing for a response to these critiques, the final answer maintains accuracy while slightly reducing the confidence score to account for historical nuances and theoretical possibilities. This process demonstrates how PRP can lead to more calibrated confidence estimates compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Peer Review Prompting method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated peer reviews and responses to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of critiques generated, assessing their relevance and impact on the final confidence scores, and identifying patterns in how the model incorporates or dismisses feedback. Second, we could explore variations of the PRP method, such as using a meta-reviewer to synthesize the individual reviews, or incorporating a quantitative scoring system for each critique. Third, we could combine PRP with other calibration techniques, like ensemble methods or calibrated few-shot learning, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Lastly, if the method shows promise in certain domains but not others, we could focus on analyzing why it works well in those specific areas and potentially develop domain-specific variants of the PRP method."
