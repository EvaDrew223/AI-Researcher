        "Title": "Causal Graph Prompting for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately track and propagate uncertainty through multi-step reasoning processes, leading to overconfident conclusions. This problem is particularly evident in complex reasoning tasks that require multiple steps of inference and uncertainty propagation.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like chain-of-thought prompting improve multi-step reasoning but don't explicitly handle uncertainty propagation. Causal graphs provide a principled way to represent dependencies between variables and propagate uncertainties. Adapting this framework for LLM prompting could lead to more accurate uncertainty quantification in complex reasoning tasks. By guiding LLMs to construct and reason with causal graphs, we can potentially improve their ability to track and propagate uncertainties, leading to more calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel prompting technique called Causal Graph Prompting (CGP) that guides the LLM through the following steps: 1) Construct a causal graph representing the relationships between key variables in the problem. 2) Assign initial uncertainty estimates to root nodes. 3) Propagate uncertainties through the graph using verbal descriptions of probabilistic operations. 4) Aggregate uncertainties at the leaf nodes to produce a final confidence estimate. This approach encourages the model to explicitly reason about how uncertainties compound and interact throughout the problem-solving process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets are suitable for evaluating multi-step reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement and evaluate the following baselines: a) Direct prompting (no special instructions), b) Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting (appending 'Let's approach this step by step:' to the question), c) Few-shot chain-of-thought prompting (providing 2-3 examples of step-by-step reasoning before the main question).",
            "Step 3: Causal Graph Prompting Implementation": "Develop a prompt template for CGP that guides the model through the four steps mentioned in the proposed method. The prompt should include instructions for graph construction, uncertainty assignment, propagation, and aggregation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each problem in the datasets, we will use both the baseline methods and CGP to generate solutions and confidence estimates. We will evaluate performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy of final answers, b) Calibration error (comparing estimated confidence with actual accuracy), c) Brier score (a proper scoring rule for probabilistic predictions), d) Quality of generated causal graphs (manually evaluated on a subset of problems).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CGP against the baselines. Analyze how well the model constructs causal graphs, assigns uncertainties, and propagates them. Investigate cases where CGP performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does John have now?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "John has 6 apples now.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does John have now? Let's approach this step by step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Let's approach this step by step:\n1. John starts with 5 apples.\n2. He gives 2 apples to his friend, so now he has 5 - 2 = 3 apples.\n3. Then he buys 3 more apples, so we add 3 to his current number: 3 + 3 = 6 apples.\nTherefore, John has 6 apples now.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Causal Graph Prompting)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does John have now?\n\nLet's solve this problem using a causal graph approach:\n\n1. Construct a causal graph:\nIdentify the key variables and their relationships. Draw the graph using '->' to indicate causal relationships.\n\n2. Assign initial uncertainties:\nFor each root node (variable not influenced by others), assign an initial uncertainty level (High, Medium, Low, or None).\n\n3. Propagate uncertainties:\nDescribe how uncertainties propagate through the graph, considering how operations affect uncertainty.\n\n4. Aggregate uncertainties:\nCombine uncertainties to produce a final confidence estimate for the answer.\n\n5. Provide the final answer and confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Causal Graph Prompting)": "1. Causal Graph:\nInitial Apples -> Apples After Giving -> Final Apples\nBought Apples -> Final Apples\n\n2. Initial Uncertainties:\nInitial Apples: None (given as 5)\nBought Apples: None (given as 3)\n\n3. Uncertainty Propagation:\nApples After Giving: None (simple subtraction)\nFinal Apples: None (simple addition)\n\n4. Uncertainty Aggregation:\nSince all operations involve certain values and simple arithmetic, the final uncertainty remains None.\n\n5. Final Answer and Confidence:\nJohn has 6 apples now.\nConfidence: Very High (100%)\n\nExplanation:\nInitial Apples (5) - Given Away (2) = 3\n3 + Bought Apples (3) = 6\n\nThe problem involves only simple arithmetic with certain values, so there's no uncertainty in the calculation.",
            "explanation": "The Causal Graph Prompting method provides a structured approach to solving the problem while explicitly considering uncertainties. In this simple example, there are no uncertainties, but the method demonstrates how it would handle more complex problems with uncertain variables or operations. The baseline methods, while correct, don't provide any information about confidence or uncertainty in the answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Causal Graph Prompting method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification or calibration, we can explore several alternatives: 1) Analyze the generated causal graphs to understand if the model is constructing them correctly. If not, we could provide more explicit instructions or examples for graph construction. 2) Investigate whether the uncertainty propagation step is the bottleneck. We could experiment with different verbal descriptions of probabilistic operations to see if some are more effective than others. 3) If the method works well for some types of problems but not others, we could develop a hybrid approach that uses CGP for problems where it excels and falls back to standard chain-of-thought for others. 4) We could also explore combining CGP with other techniques like self-consistency or calibrated few-shot prompting to see if their strengths complement each other. 5) Finally, if the results are interesting but not conclusively better, we could pivot to an analysis paper that explores how LLMs reason about uncertainty and causal relationships, using the CGP method as a probe to investigate these capabilities."
