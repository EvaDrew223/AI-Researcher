    "idea_name": "Confidence Gradient Exploration",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different parts of their responses, leading to overconfidence in incorrect information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on global confidence scores or simple binary classifications of certain/uncertain statements.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by techniques in computer vision for generating saliency maps, we propose exploring the 'confidence landscape' of LLM responses to identify areas of high and low certainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Gradient Exploration (CGE), a novel prompting technique that iteratively probes an LLM's confidence at different granularities. Starting with the full response, CGE recursively splits it into smaller segments and prompts the model to rate its confidence for each part. This process continues until reaching word-level granularity, creating a hierarchical confidence map. The prompt includes instructions like 'Rate your confidence in the following statement from 0-100:' and 'Now split this statement into two parts and rate each separately.' By analyzing the resulting confidence gradients, we can identify specific phrases or concepts where the model's certainty changes dramatically, potentially indicating areas of weakness or uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CGE against baselines like global confidence scores and binary certainty classification on tasks including factual QA, logical reasoning, and open-ended generation. We'll measure the correlation between confidence gradients and actual error rates, as well as the ability to predict and localize mistakes in model outputs."

        "Title": "Confidence Gradient Exploration: Mapping Uncertainty in Large Language Model Responses",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different parts of their responses, leading to overconfidence in incorrect information. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis or legal advice.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on global confidence scores or simple binary classifications of certain/uncertain statements, which fail to capture the nuanced variations in confidence across different parts of a response. Inspired by techniques in computer vision for generating saliency maps, we propose exploring the 'confidence landscape' of LLM responses to identify areas of high and low certainty. This approach could provide more granular insights into model uncertainty, potentially improving the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Gradient Exploration (CGE), a novel prompting technique that iteratively probes an LLM's confidence at different granularities. Starting with the full response, CGE recursively splits it into smaller segments and prompts the model to rate its confidence for each part. This process continues until reaching word-level granularity, creating a hierarchical confidence map.

By analyzing the resulting confidence gradients, we can identify specific phrases or concepts where the model's certainty changes dramatically, potentially indicating areas of weakness or uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate CGE: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, (2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and (3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of domains and complexity levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Global Confidence Score: Prompt the model to generate a single confidence score for the entire response. (2) Binary Certainty Classification: Prompt the model to classify each sentence as 'certain' or 'uncertain'.",
            "Step 3: CGE Implementation": "Implement the CGE method as follows: a) Generate initial response to the input question. b) Prompt for overall confidence score. c) Split response into sentences and prompt for confidence scores. d) Recursively split sentences into phrases and prompt for confidence scores. e) Continue until word-level granularity is reached.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design effective prompts for each step of CGE. For example: 'Rate your confidence in the following statement from 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain: [statement]' and 'Split the following statement into two meaningful parts and rate your confidence in each part separately: [statement]'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: (1) Correlation between confidence scores and actual correctness. (2) Precision and recall in identifying incorrect statements. (3) Mean absolute error between predicted confidence and actual correctness.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Generate responses using standard prompting. b) Apply baseline methods to get confidence scores. c) Apply CGE to generate hierarchical confidence maps. d) Compute evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the results to compare CGE against baselines. Investigate patterns in confidence gradients, such as areas of sudden confidence drops or consistently low confidence regions. Examine how these patterns correlate with actual errors or uncertainties in the model's responses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Global Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. How confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Global Confidence)": "Confidence: 100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Binary Classification)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. Classify each part of this answer as 'certain' or 'uncertain'.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Binary Classification)": "1. 'The capital of France is' - Certain\n2. 'Paris' - Certain",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CGE; Step 1: Overall Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. Rate your confidence in this entire answer from 0-100:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CGE; Step 1: Overall Confidence)": "Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CGE; Step 2: Sentence-level Confidence)": "Split the following statement into two parts and rate your confidence in each part separately from 0-100: 'The capital of France is Paris.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CGE; Step 2: Sentence-level Confidence)": "1. 'The capital of France is' - Confidence: 100\n2. 'Paris' - Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CGE; Step 3: Word-level Confidence)": "Rate your confidence in each word of the statement 'The capital of France is Paris' from 0-100:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CGE; Step 3: Word-level Confidence)": "'The': 100, 'capital': 100, 'of': 100, 'France': 100, 'is': 100, 'Paris': 100",
            "explanation": "CGE provides a more granular view of the model's confidence across different parts of the response, potentially revealing nuanced uncertainties that global or binary methods might miss. In this simple example, the model shows high confidence throughout, but in more complex cases, CGE could reveal specific words or phrases where confidence drops."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CGE does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why fine-grained confidence estimation is challenging for LLMs. We could investigate patterns in how confidence varies across different types of questions or knowledge domains. Additionally, we could explore how different prompting strategies affect the model's ability to estimate its own confidence. Another direction could be to analyze the relationship between the model's stated confidence and various factors such as token probabilities, perplexity scores, or the presence of certain linguistic features in the response. This analysis could provide insights into the limitations of current LLMs in self-assessment and suggest directions for future improvements in model architecture or training techniques."
