    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty across different aspects of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in complex, multi-faceted tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-shot confidence estimates or basic uncertainty sampling techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down complex queries into constituent narrative elements, we can probe the model's confidence more granularly and construct a more nuanced uncertainty profile.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting process: 1) Narrative Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the query into key narrative elements (e.g., entities, relationships, events). 2) Element-wise Confidence Elicitation: For each narrative element, prompt the model to provide a confidence score and justification. 3) Confidence Spectrum Construction: Aggregate the element-wise confidences into a spectrum, highlighting areas of high and low certainty. 4) Holistic Confidence Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize an overall confidence estimate based on the spectrum, explaining how different elements contribute to the final assessment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare our method against baseline confidence estimation techniques on multi-domain question answering datasets, evaluating calibration, discrimination, and explanatory power of the confidence estimates."

        "Title": "Multi-Stage Narrative Decomposition for Granular Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty across different aspects of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in complex, multi-faceted tasks. Current approaches typically rely on single-shot confidence estimates or basic uncertainty sampling techniques, which fail to capture the nuanced uncertainty profiles inherent in complex queries.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often treat queries as monolithic entities, failing to account for the varying levels of certainty a model may have across different aspects of a complex question. By breaking down complex queries into constituent narrative elements, we can probe the model's confidence more granularly and construct a more nuanced uncertainty profile. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where we often assess our confidence in different parts of a complex problem separately before synthesizing an overall judgment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting process: 1) Narrative Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the query into key narrative elements (e.g., entities, relationships, events). 2) Element-wise Confidence Elicitation: For each narrative element, prompt the model to provide a confidence score and justification. 3) Confidence Spectrum Construction: Aggregate the element-wise confidences into a spectrum, highlighting areas of high and low certainty. 4) Holistic Confidence Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize an overall confidence estimate based on the spectrum, explaining how different elements contribute to the final assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-domain question answering datasets that involve complex, multi-faceted queries. Specifically, we'll use HotpotQA for multi-hop reasoning questions and TruthfulQA for questions requiring factual accuracy across multiple dimensions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for the entire query. 2) Basic uncertainty sampling: Use Monte Carlo Dropout or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Narrative Decomposition Prompt": "Design a prompt that instructs the model to break down the query into key narrative elements. Example prompt: 'Given the following question, break it down into its key narrative elements (entities, relationships, events, etc.): [QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Element-wise Confidence Elicitation": "For each narrative element identified in Step 3, prompt the model to provide a confidence score (0-100) and justification. Example prompt: 'For the narrative element '[ELEMENT]', provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification for your score.'",
            "Step 5: Confidence Spectrum Construction": "Aggregate the element-wise confidences into a visual spectrum or table, highlighting areas of high and low certainty.",
            "Step 6: Holistic Confidence Synthesis": "Prompt the model to synthesize an overall confidence estimate based on the spectrum. Example prompt: 'Given the confidence spectrum for the narrative elements, provide an overall confidence score (0-100) for the entire question. Explain how different elements contribute to your final assessment.'",
            "Step 7: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 8: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence estimates with its actual performance. 2) Discrimination: Assess how well the confidence estimates distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. 3) Explanatory power: Qualitatively evaluate the justifications provided for element-wise and holistic confidence estimates.",
            "Step 9: Comparative Analysis": "Compare the performance of our multi-stage narrative decomposition method against the baseline methods across all evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing or modifying individual stages of our method to understand the contribution of each component."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: Who was the first person to receive a Nobel Prize in two different sciences? Provide your answer and a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: Marie Curie was the first person to receive Nobel Prizes in two different sciences. She won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Narrative Decomposition)": "Q: Who was the first person to receive a Nobel Prize in two different sciences? Break this question down into its key narrative elements.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Narrative Decomposition)": "1. Identity of the person\n2. Concept of 'first' (chronological order)\n3. Nobel Prize as an award\n4. Multiple Nobel Prizes (specifically two)\n5. Different scientific fields",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Element-wise Confidence Elicitation)": "For the narrative element 'Identity of the person', provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification for your score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Element-wise Confidence Elicitation)": "Confidence score: 98\nJustification: I'm highly confident about the identity of the person because Marie Curie is widely known and celebrated for this unique achievement. Her story is well-documented in historical records and frequently cited in scientific literature.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Holistic Confidence Synthesis)": "Given the confidence spectrum for the narrative elements, provide an overall confidence score (0-100) for the entire question. Explain how different elements contribute to your final assessment.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Holistic Confidence Synthesis)": "Overall confidence score: 96\nExplanation: The high confidence in the identity of Marie Curie (98) and the concept of the Nobel Prize (99) significantly contribute to the overall confidence. The slightly lower confidence in the exact chronology (94) and the specifics of the scientific fields (95) slightly reduce the overall score. The combination of these elements results in a very high overall confidence of 96.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed method provides a more nuanced and granular assessment of the model's confidence across different aspects of the question. This allows for a more accurate overall confidence estimate and provides valuable insights into which parts of the question the model is more or less certain about."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-stage narrative decomposition method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper that explores the patterns and inconsistencies in LLM confidence across different types of narrative elements. We could investigate questions such as: Are LLMs consistently more confident about certain types of narrative elements (e.g., entities vs. relationships)? How does the granularity of narrative decomposition affect the final confidence estimates? Do LLMs show systematic biases in their confidence assessments for certain topics or domains? This analysis could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in assessing their own knowledge and uncertainty, potentially informing future approaches to improving their calibration and reliability."
