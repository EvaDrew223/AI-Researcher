        "Problem": "LLMs often maintain high confidence even when their responses drift semantically from the original query, leading to overconfidence in irrelevant or incorrect outputs.",

        "Title": "Semantic Drift-Aware Confidence Calibration for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often maintain high confidence even when their responses drift semantically from the original query, leading to overconfidence in irrelevant or incorrect outputs. This misalignment between confidence and semantic relevance can result in unreliable and potentially misleading information being presented to users.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to confidence calibration in LLMs primarily focus on direct confidence elicitation or simple perturbation techniques. These methods, while valuable, do not explicitly address the issue of semantic drift during response generation. By intentionally inducing semantic drift and probing the model's awareness of this drift, we can stress test the model's confidence calibration mechanisms and potentially develop more robust confidence estimation techniques. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we tend to become less confident as we realize we're straying from the original topic.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Semantic Drift-Aware Confidence Calibration (SDACC), involves four main steps: 1) Initial Response Generation: Prompt the model to answer the original query. 2) Iterative Semantic Drift: Repeatedly prompt the model to generate responses that are incrementally more semantically distant from the original query. 3) Drift Awareness Probing: At each step, prompt the model to assess its semantic distance from the original query and provide a confidence score. 4) Confidence Trajectory Analysis: Analyze how the model's confidence changes as semantic drift increases, identifying points of overconfidence or appropriate uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of question-answering datasets, including SQuAD, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. These datasets provide a good mix of factual and open-ended questions.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Initial Response Generation": "For each question in the dataset, prompt the model to generate an initial response. Use the following prompt template: 'Question: {question}\\nAnswer:'",
            "Step 4: Iterative Semantic Drift": "For each initial response, generate a series of increasingly drifted responses. Use the following prompt template: 'Given the following question and answer, provide a response that is slightly more semantically distant from the original question, while still attempting to be relevant:\\nQuestion: {question}\\nPrevious Answer: {previous_answer}\\nMore Distant Answer:'",
            "Step 5: Drift Awareness Probing": "After each drifted response, prompt the model to assess its semantic distance and confidence. Use the following prompt template: 'Given the original question and your last answer, please provide:\\n1) A score from 0 to 10 indicating how semantically distant your last answer is from the original question (0 being identical, 10 being completely unrelated)\\n2) Your confidence in the correctness and relevance of your last answer (as a percentage)\\nQuestion: {question}\\nLast Answer: {last_answer}\\nSemantic Distance Score (0-10):\\nConfidence (%):' ",
            "Step 6: Data Collection": "For each question, collect the following data: original question, initial response, series of drifted responses (we suggest 5 drift steps), semantic distance scores, and confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Confidence Trajectory Analysis": "For each question, plot the confidence scores against the semantic distance scores. Calculate the correlation between semantic distance and confidence.",
            "Step 8: Human Evaluation": "Randomly sample 100 question-answer pairs from each drift step. Have human annotators rate the relevance and correctness of these answers. Compare human ratings with model-reported confidence.",
            "Step 9: Baseline Comparison": "Compare the performance of our method against two baselines: 1) Direct confidence elicitation without drift induction, 2) Confidence estimation using answer likelihood from the model.",
            "Step 10: Results Analysis": "Analyze the results to determine: 1) How well the model's confidence aligns with semantic drift, 2) At what point of semantic drift does confidence typically start to decrease, 3) How the model's confidence compares to human judgments of relevance and correctness."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Question: What is the capital of France?\\nAnswer this question and provide your confidence in your answer as a percentage.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\\nConfidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDACC; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Question: What is the capital of France?\\nAnswer:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDACC; Step 1: Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDACC; Step 2: Drift Step 1)": "Given the following question and answer, provide a response that is slightly more semantically distant from the original question, while still attempting to be relevant:\\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\\nPrevious Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\\nMore Distant Answer:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDACC; Step 2: Drift Step 1)": "Paris, the capital of France, is known for its iconic Eiffel Tower and world-class cuisine.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDACC; Step 3: Drift Awareness Probe 1)": "Given the original question and your last answer, please provide:\\n1) A score from 0 to 10 indicating how semantically distant your last answer is from the original question (0 being identical, 10 being completely unrelated)\\n2) Your confidence in the correctness and relevance of your last answer (as a percentage)\\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\\nLast Answer: Paris, the capital of France, is known for its iconic Eiffel Tower and world-class cuisine.\\nSemantic Distance Score (0-10):\\nConfidence (%):",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDACC; Step 3: Drift Awareness Probe 1)": "Semantic Distance Score (0-10): 3\\nConfidence (%): 95%",
            "explanation": "The SDACC method allows for a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence as the response drifts semantically. In this example, we can see that even with a slight drift (adding information about Paris), the model recognizes a small increase in semantic distance and a slight decrease in confidence. As we continue this process, we expect to see further increases in semantic distance and decreases in confidence, providing a more accurate picture of the model's uncertainty as it moves away from directly answering the original question."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SDACC method doesn't yield significant improvements in confidence calibration, we can pivot our analysis to focus on understanding why LLMs struggle with recognizing semantic drift. We could investigate patterns in the types of questions or topics where drift awareness is particularly challenging. Additionally, we could explore alternative methods of inducing and measuring semantic drift, such as using embedding-based similarity metrics or fine-tuning smaller models specifically for drift detection. Another direction could be to analyze the relationship between semantic drift and factual accuracy, which could provide insights into how LLMs balance staying on-topic with providing accurate information. These analyses could lead to a valuable paper on the limitations of current LLMs in metacognitive tasks and suggest new directions for improving their self-awareness capabilities."
