        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when faced with novel or ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like confidence scores or ensemble methods provide limited insight into model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by genetic algorithms, we hypothesize that iteratively mutating prompts can reveal areas of model uncertainty by exploring the stability of responses across slight variations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Stochastic Prompt Mutation (SPM), which generates a population of slightly mutated versions of the original prompt. These mutations include synonym substitution, sentence reordering, and insertion/deletion of qualifier phrases. The model processes each mutated prompt, and we analyze the variance in responses to quantify uncertainty. High variance indicates areas of uncertainty, while consistent responses across mutations suggest higher confidence. We also incorporate a 'fitness function' that evaluates the semantic similarity between the original and mutated prompts to ensure meaningful comparisons.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SPM against baselines like direct uncertainty estimation and ensemble methods on tasks including open-ended question answering and fact verification. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human judgments of model uncertainty."

        "Title": "Stochastic Prompt Mutation for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when faced with novel or ambiguous queries. This inability to reliably assess confidence can lead to overconfident predictions on unfamiliar inputs, potentially resulting in misinformation or inappropriate actions in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like confidence scores or ensemble methods provide limited insight into model uncertainty. Inspired by genetic algorithms, we hypothesize that iteratively mutating prompts can reveal areas of model uncertainty by exploring the stability of responses across slight variations. This method leverages the model's own capabilities to generate and evaluate variations, potentially offering a more nuanced and adaptive approach to uncertainty quantification compared to static confidence metrics.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Stochastic Prompt Mutation (SPM), which generates a population of slightly mutated versions of the original prompt. These mutations include synonym substitution, sentence reordering, and insertion/deletion of qualifier phrases. The model processes each mutated prompt, and we analyze the variance in responses to quantify uncertainty. High variance indicates areas of uncertainty, while consistent responses across mutations suggest higher confidence. We also incorporate a 'fitness function' that evaluates the semantic similarity between the original and mutated prompts to ensure meaningful comparisons.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering different domains: (a) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (b) AmbigQA for ambiguous questions, and (c) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement baseline methods: (a) Direct uncertainty estimation: Use the model's softmax probabilities or perplexity as uncertainty measure. (b) Ensemble method: Use predictions from multiple model checkpoints or different models.",
            "Step 3: SPM Implementation": "Develop the Stochastic Prompt Mutation algorithm: (a) Implement mutation operators: synonym substitution, sentence reordering, qualifier insertion/deletion. (b) Create a fitness function using sentence transformers to calculate semantic similarity between original and mutated prompts. (c) Generate a population of mutated prompts for each input query.",
            "Step 4: Response Generation": "For each dataset and method (baseline and SPM): (a) Generate responses using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs. (b) For SPM, generate responses for each mutated prompt in the population.",
            "Step 5: Uncertainty Quantification": "For SPM: (a) Calculate response variance across mutated prompts. (b) Normalize variance scores to [0, 1] range. For baselines: Use their respective uncertainty measures.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare SPM against baselines using: (a) Calibration error: Plot predicted uncertainty vs. actual error rate. (b) Brier score: Measure accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (c) Spearman correlation: Between model uncertainty and human judgments of answer correctness (collect from crowdsourcing platforms).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct ablation studies: (a) Impact of different mutation operators. (b) Effect of population size on uncertainty estimates. (c) Correlation between semantic similarity (fitness) and response variance."

            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Direct Uncertainty Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 0.95",
                "Ensemble Method Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong (4/5 models), Buzz Aldrin (1/5 models). Uncertainty: 0.2",
                "Explanation": "Baselines provide a single uncertainty score, which may not capture nuanced uncertainties."
            },
            "SPM Example": {
                "Original Prompt": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Mutated Prompts": [
                    "Q: Which individual initially set foot on the lunar surface?",
                    "Q: Can you name the pioneer who first stepped onto the moon?",
                    "Q: In the history of space exploration, who was the first human to walk on the moon's surface?"
                ],
                "Responses": [
                    "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
                    "The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong.",
                    "Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut, was the first human to set foot on the lunar surface."
                ],
                "Uncertainty Score": "0.05 (Low variance in responses indicates high confidence)",
                "Explanation": "SPM generates multiple variations of the question, allowing for a more robust assessment of the model's certainty. The consistent responses across mutations suggest high confidence in this well-known fact."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SPM doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why certain types of questions or domains benefit more from prompt mutation than others. We could investigate the relationship between prompt complexity and uncertainty estimation accuracy, or analyze how different mutation strategies affect the model's responses. Additionally, we could explore combining SPM with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it to augment ensemble approaches or as a feature in a meta-model for uncertainty prediction. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of prompt-based uncertainty estimation techniques and guide future research in this area."
