        "Problem": "LLMs often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when faced with semantically equivalent but syntactically different queries, indicating a lack of robustness in their uncertainty quantification.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-query confidence estimation or use simple paraphrasing techniques for robustness.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from adversarial testing in computer vision, we propose to systematically perturb input queries to probe the stability of an LLM's confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Perturbation for Robustness Estimation (SPRE), a prompting method that generates multiple semantically equivalent variations of a given query using techniques such as synonym substitution, sentence structure alteration, and abstraction/specification. The prompt instructs the LLM to generate these variations, answer each one, and provide confidence scores. It then analyzes the variance in confidence across these perturbations to estimate the robustness of its uncertainty quantification. The method also prompts the LLM to explain any significant discrepancies in confidence between variations, providing insights into the sources of uncertainty instability.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SPRE against standard confidence estimation methods on diverse datasets, measuring both calibration accuracy and consistency across perturbations. We'll introduce metrics such as Confidence Stability Score (CSS) to quantify the robustness of uncertainty estimates across semantic variations."

        "Title": "SPRE: Semantic Perturbation for Robust Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when faced with semantically equivalent but syntactically different queries, indicating a lack of robustness in their uncertainty quantification. This inconsistency can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications and hinders the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on single-query confidence estimation or use simple paraphrasing techniques for robustness. These methods fail to capture the full spectrum of semantic variations and their impact on model uncertainty. Drawing inspiration from adversarial testing in computer vision, we propose to systematically perturb input queries to probe the stability of an LLM's confidence estimates. This approach allows us to better understand and quantify the model's uncertainty across a range of semantically equivalent inputs, leading to more robust and reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Perturbation for Robustness Estimation (SPRE), a prompting method that generates multiple semantically equivalent variations of a given query using techniques such as synonym substitution, sentence structure alteration, and abstraction/specification. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Generate semantic variations: Prompt the LLM to create multiple semantically equivalent versions of the input query. 2) Answer generation: For each variation, prompt the LLM to generate an answer and provide a confidence score. 3) Variance analysis: Calculate the variance in confidence scores across all variations. 4) Discrepancy explanation: Prompt the LLM to explain any significant discrepancies in confidence between variations. 5) Robustness score calculation: Compute a Confidence Stability Score (CSS) based on the variance and explanations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets that cover various domains and question types. We will use: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 3) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation methods as baselines: 1) Direct confidence scoring: Prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Calibrated confidence: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the model's confidence estimates. 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use multiple forward passes with different prompts and calculate the variance in predictions.",
            "Step 3: SPRE Implementation": "Implement the SPRE method with the following sub-steps: a) Semantic variation generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 5 semantically equivalent variations of each input query. b) Answer and confidence generation: For each variation, prompt the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100). c) Variance calculation: Compute the variance in confidence scores across all variations. d) Discrepancy explanation: If the variance exceeds a threshold (e.g., 20), prompt the LLM to explain the discrepancies. e) CSS calculation: Compute the Confidence Stability Score as CSS = 100 - (variance * 10), capped at 0 and 100.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset: 1) Apply baseline methods and SPRE to all questions. 2) Record answers, confidence scores, and CSS for SPRE. 3) For a subset of high-variance cases, record LLM explanations for discrepancies.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "1) Compare the calibration of baseline methods and SPRE using Expected Calibration Error (ECE). 2) Analyze the correlation between CSS and answer correctness. 3) Evaluate the consistency of answers across semantic variations. 4) Qualitatively assess the usefulness of discrepancy explanations.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1) Identify patterns in queries that lead to high variance in confidence. 2) Analyze the types of semantic variations that most affect confidence estimates. 3) Investigate the relationship between task difficulty and confidence stability. 4) Examine how different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4) compare in terms of confidence stability."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98",
            "SPRE Prompt Input (Step 1: Generate Variations)": "Generate 5 semantically equivalent variations of the question 'What is the capital of France?'. Ensure that the variations maintain the same meaning but use different wording or sentence structures.",
            "SPRE Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Generate Variations)": "1. Which city serves as the capital of France?\n2. Can you name the French capital?\n3. In France, what urban center is designated as the nation's capital?\n4. What is the primary city and seat of government in France?\n5. If asked about France's capital, what would be the correct answer?",
            "SPRE Prompt Input (Step 2: Answer and Confidence)": "For each of the following questions, provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100:\n1. Which city serves as the capital of France?\n2. Can you name the French capital?\n3. In France, what urban center is designated as the nation's capital?\n4. What is the primary city and seat of government in France?\n5. If asked about France's capital, what would be the correct answer?",
            "SPRE Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Answer and Confidence)": "1. Answer: Paris. Confidence: 100\n2. Answer: Paris. Confidence: 100\n3. Answer: Paris. Confidence: 99\n4. Answer: Paris. Confidence: 100\n5. Answer: Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "SPRE Prompt Input (Step 3: Explain Discrepancies)": "The confidence scores for the variations of the question about France's capital were [100, 100, 99, 100, 100]. Please explain any discrepancies in these confidence scores and why they might occur.",
            "SPRE Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Explain Discrepancies)": "The slight discrepancy in confidence scores (99 vs. 100) is minimal and likely due to the phrasing of the third question, which uses more formal language ('urban center', 'designated'). This might introduce a tiny amount of uncertainty, as it could be interpreted as asking for a more official or legal designation. However, the difference is negligible, and all scores indicate very high confidence in the answer 'Paris'.",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how SPRE generates multiple semantic variations of a query, obtains confidence scores for each, and analyzes discrepancies. In this case, the confidence scores are very consistent, indicating high reliability in the model's answer. The slight variation prompts an explanation, which could be valuable for understanding subtle effects of phrasing on model confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SPRE does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will pivot to an in-depth analysis of how semantic variations affect LLM confidence. This could involve: 1) Categorizing types of semantic variations (e.g., synonym substitution, structural changes, abstraction) and analyzing their individual impacts on confidence. 2) Investigating whether certain topics or question types are more susceptible to confidence instability across semantic variations. 3) Examining the relationship between answer correctness and confidence stability. 4) Analyzing the quality and consistency of LLM-generated explanations for confidence discrepancies. This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and potential weaknesses in their uncertainty quantification, potentially leading to new research directions or improved prompting strategies for more robust confidence estimation."
