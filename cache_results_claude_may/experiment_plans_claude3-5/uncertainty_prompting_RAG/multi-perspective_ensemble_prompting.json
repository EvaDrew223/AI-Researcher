    "idea_name": "Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Single-perspective prompting can lead to biased or incomplete uncertainty estimates, especially for complex or controversial topics.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current ensemble methods typically use multiple model runs or simple variations of the same prompt.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often consider multiple perspectives or consult with diverse experts to form a well-calibrated view of their uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting, a technique that simulates a diverse panel of experts within a single LLM. The method involves crafting a series of prompts that instruct the model to adopt different personas, each with a unique background, expertise, and perspective on the given question. These personas are designed to cover a wide range of viewpoints and knowledge bases. The LLM is then asked to provide confidence estimates and justifications from each perspective. These multi-perspective estimates are aggregated using a novel weighting scheme that considers the relevance and potential biases of each persona. This approach aims to produce a more comprehensive and well-calibrated uncertainty estimate that accounts for diverse viewpoints and potential blind spots.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting on a diverse set of complex, potentially controversial topics. Compare against standard single-perspective and simple ensemble methods, measuring improvements in calibration and robustness across different domains."

        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Single-perspective prompting can lead to biased or incomplete uncertainty estimates, especially for complex or controversial topics. This issue limits the reliability and applicability of large language models in decision-critical domains where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current ensemble methods typically use multiple model runs or simple variations of the same prompt, which may not capture the full range of perspectives on a given topic. Human experts often consider multiple viewpoints or consult with diverse experts to form a well-calibrated view of their uncertainty. By simulating this process within a single LLM, we aim to produce more comprehensive and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that account for diverse viewpoints and potential blind spots.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting (MPEP), a technique that simulates a diverse panel of experts within a single LLM. The method involves the following steps:\n1. Design a set of diverse personas, each with a unique background, expertise, and perspective relevant to the given question.\n2. Craft prompts for each persona, instructing the model to adopt that perspective and provide an answer with a confidence estimate.\n3. Generate responses from each persona using the LLM.\n4. Aggregate the multi-perspective estimates using a novel weighting scheme that considers the relevance and potential biases of each persona.\n5. Produce a final uncertainty estimate and justification based on the aggregated responses.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of complex, potentially controversial topics from existing datasets such as MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) and TruthfulQA. Select a subset of questions that span various domains including science, politics, ethics, and current events.",
            "Step 2: Persona Design": "Create a set of 5-7 diverse personas, each with a distinct background, expertise, and potential biases. For example: 1) Academic Researcher, 2) Industry Expert, 3) Skeptical Journalist, 4) Experienced Practitioner, 5) Ethical Philosopher, 6) Data Analyst, 7) General Public Representative.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Engineering": "Develop a template for persona-based prompts that includes: 1) Persona description, 2) Task instructions, 3) Request for confidence estimate, 4) Request for justification. Example:\n\"You are a [Persona Description]. Please answer the following question from your perspective, providing a confidence estimate (0-100%) and a brief justification for your answer:\n[Question]\nAnswer:\nConfidence:\nJustification:\"",
            "Step 4: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard single-perspective prompting, 2) Simple ensemble method using multiple runs of the same prompt.",
            "Step 5: MPEP Implementation": "For each question in the dataset:\n1. Generate responses from each persona using the designed prompts.\n2. Extract answers, confidence estimates, and justifications from the responses.\n3. Implement the aggregation method to combine the multi-perspective estimates.",
            "Step 6: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for evaluation. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-v1 to assess generalizability across different LLMs.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics:\n1. Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error)\n2. Brier score\n3. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)\n4. F1 score for binary questions\n5. Spearman's rank correlation between confidence and correctness",
            "Step 8: Experiments": "1. Compare MPEP against baselines on the full dataset.\n2. Analyze performance across different domains and question types.\n3. Conduct ablation studies on the number and types of personas used.\n4. Evaluate the impact of different aggregation methods.\n5. Assess the quality and diversity of justifications provided.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "1. Quantitative analysis: Compare performance metrics across methods and domains.\n2. Qualitative analysis: Examine cases where MPEP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.\n3. Bias analysis: Assess how MPEP affects biases present in single-perspective responses.\n4. Calibration analysis: Compare calibration curves of MPEP vs. baselines.",
            "Step 10: Robustness Check": "Test the method's robustness by:\n1. Varying the order of personas in the prompt.\n2. Introducing intentionally biased or incorrect personas.\n3. Applying the method to out-of-distribution questions."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the current scientific consensus on the primary causes of climate change?\nA: Provide an answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The current scientific consensus is that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary causes of climate change. This has led to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide, which trap heat and cause global temperatures to rise.\nConfidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "You are an [Academic Researcher] specializing in climate science. Please answer the following question from your perspective, providing a confidence estimate (0-100%) and a brief justification for your answer:\nQ: What is the current scientific consensus on the primary causes of climate change?\nAnswer:\nConfidence:\nJustification:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: The current scientific consensus overwhelmingly attributes the primary causes of climate change to human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This anthropogenic forcing has led to a rapid increase in global average temperatures, far exceeding natural variability.\nConfidence: 98%\nJustification: This conclusion is based on multiple lines of evidence, including direct observations of rising temperatures, satellite measurements of Earth's energy imbalance, paleoclimate records, and sophisticated climate models. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), representing thousands of scientists worldwide, has stated with high confidence that human activities are the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century. The convergence of evidence from various scientific disciplines and the consistent findings across numerous peer-reviewed studies support this high level of confidence.",
            "explanation": "The MPEP method allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the question. By incorporating multiple perspectives (e.g., Academic Researcher, Industry Expert, Skeptical Journalist), we can capture a broader range of viewpoints and potential uncertainties. This approach is likely to produce a more robust and well-calibrated final uncertainty estimate compared to the single-perspective baseline."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MPEP method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated responses to understand why the method didn't perform as expected. This might involve examining the diversity and quality of perspectives generated, the effectiveness of the aggregation method, or potential biases introduced by the persona designs. We could then use these insights to refine the method, perhaps by developing more sophisticated persona selection algorithms or exploring alternative aggregation techniques. Additionally, we could shift focus to analyze how different types of questions or domains benefit (or don't benefit) from multi-perspective approaches, potentially uncovering valuable insights about the nature of uncertainty in language models. Finally, we could explore combining MPEP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as calibration techniques or Bayesian approaches, to create a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches."
