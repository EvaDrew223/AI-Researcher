    "idea_name": "Cognitive Load Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, often providing overconfident responses even when faced with complex or ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches include direct confidence elicitation, token probability analysis, and ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Human cognition research shows that increased cognitive load correlates with decreased confidence in decision-making. We can leverage this insight to design prompts that induce varying levels of cognitive load in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cognitive Load Prompting (CLP), a technique that systematically increases the complexity of the task presented to the LLM. The method involves: 1) Decomposing the original query into subtasks of increasing difficulty. 2) Prompting the LLM to solve these subtasks sequentially, each time asking for a confidence estimate. 3) Introducing time pressure by instructing the model to 'think faster' for some subtasks. 4) Requesting the LLM to multitask by holding previous information in 'memory' while solving new subtasks. 5) Finally, asking the LLM to synthesize all subtask results and provide a final answer with a calibrated confidence score.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CLP against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods on diverse tasks including factual QA, logical reasoning, and open-ended generation. Evaluate using calibration metrics, selective accuracy, and correlation with human judges' confidence ratings."

        "Title": "Cognitive Load Prompting: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Induced Task Complexity",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, frequently providing overconfident responses to complex or ambiguous queries. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, highlighting the need for better uncertainty quantification methods in LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as direct confidence elicitation, token probability analysis, and ensemble methods, have shown limited success in accurately calibrating model confidence. Drawing inspiration from human cognition research, which demonstrates a correlation between increased cognitive load and decreased confidence in decision-making, we propose a novel prompting method to induce varying levels of cognitive load in LLMs. This approach aims to leverage the LLM's own capabilities to generate more accurately calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cognitive Load Prompting (CLP), a technique that systematically increases the complexity of the task presented to the LLM to calibrate its confidence. The method involves five key steps: 1) Decomposing the original query into subtasks of increasing difficulty. 2) Prompting the LLM to solve these subtasks sequentially, requesting a confidence estimate for each. 3) Introducing time pressure by instructing the model to 'think faster' for some subtasks. 4) Requesting the LLM to multitask by holding previous information in 'memory' while solving new subtasks. 5) Finally, asking the LLM to synthesize all subtask results and provide a final answer with a calibrated confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TriviaQA for factual question answering, 2) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. Each dataset should be split into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: simply ask the question and request a confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: use different temperature settings to generate multiple outputs and compute uncertainty. 3) Ensemble method: use multiple model instances or different prompts to generate an ensemble of answers and derive uncertainty from the disagreement.",
            "Step 3: CLP Implementation": "Implement the Cognitive Load Prompting method: a) Subtask decomposition: For each question, create a prompt that breaks down the task into 3-5 subtasks of increasing difficulty. b) Sequential solving with confidence: Prompt the model to solve each subtask and provide a confidence score. c) Time pressure: For some subtasks, add instructions like 'Answer quickly' or 'You have only 10 seconds to respond'. d) Multitasking: Ask the model to refer back to previous subtask results while solving new ones. e) Final synthesis: Prompt the model to combine all subtask results and provide a final answer with a calibrated confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM from Google.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect their outputs and confidence scores. b) Run the CLP method and collect its outputs, intermediate confidence scores, and final calibrated confidence scores. c) Repeat each experiment 5 times to account for variability in model outputs.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Compare the correctness of answers across methods. b) Calibration error: Calculate the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. c) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. d) Selective accuracy: Evaluate accuracy on top-k most confident predictions. e) AUC-ROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis: a) Compare CLP performance against baselines across different task types and difficulty levels. b) Analyze how confidence scores change across subtasks in CLP. c) Investigate the impact of time pressure and multitasking on confidence calibration. d) Examine cases where CLP significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 means you are absolutely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Cognitive Load Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Let's break this down into steps:\n1. List three major cities in France.\n2. Among these cities, which one is located in the north-central part of the country?\n3. What river runs through this city?\n4. This city is known for a famous tower. What's the name of this tower?\n5. Now, considering all this information, what is the capital of France?\nFor each step, provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1. For steps 2 and 4, please answer quickly as if you only have 5 seconds. For step 3, please hold in memory the cities you mentioned in step 1 while answering.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Cognitive Load Prompting)": "1. Three major cities in France are Paris, Marseille, and Lyon. Confidence: 0.95\n2. Paris is located in the north-central part of France. Confidence: 0.9 (answered quickly)\n3. The Seine river runs through Paris. (Remembering cities: Paris, Marseille, Lyon) Confidence: 0.85\n4. The famous tower is the Eiffel Tower. Confidence: 0.95 (answered quickly)\n5. Considering all this information, the capital of France is Paris. Final confidence: 0.92",
            "Explanation": "The CLP method induces cognitive load through task decomposition, time pressure, and multitasking. This process leads to a more nuanced confidence assessment (0.92) compared to the overconfident baseline (0.99), potentially resulting in better-calibrated uncertainty estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CLP method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate which aspects of cognitive load (decomposition, time pressure, or multitasking) have the most impact on confidence estimates. This could involve ablation studies where we remove each component of CLP and observe the effects. Additionally, we could analyze how different types of questions (factual, reasoning, open-ended) respond to CLP, which might reveal task-specific patterns in confidence calibration. Another direction could be to explore how CLP affects the actual reasoning process of the LLM, by comparing the intermediate steps generated in CLP with those from a standard chain-of-thought prompt. This could provide insights into how induced cognitive load influences the model's problem-solving approach and potentially inform new prompting strategies."
