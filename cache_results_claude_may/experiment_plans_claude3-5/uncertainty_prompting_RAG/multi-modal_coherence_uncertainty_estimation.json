        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs typically focus on text-only inputs, neglecting the potential for improved calibration through multi-modal coherence analysis.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly work with text data and don't leverage the potential of cross-modal information for uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By assessing the coherence between textual descriptions and associated images or other modalities, we can potentially achieve more robust uncertainty estimates, especially for tasks involving real-world knowledge.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Modal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation (MMCUE), a technique that leverages the alignment between text and image modalities to calibrate uncertainty. The method involves: 1) Given a text query, prompt the model to generate or retrieve relevant image descriptions. 2) Present these descriptions alongside actual images (some matching, some not) and prompt the model to assess the coherence between each text-image pair. 3) Guide the model to use these coherence assessments to calibrate its confidence in the original query. For example, for a question about animal behavior, the model might generate descriptions of relevant scenes, then assess how well these align with presented images, using this information to gauge its overall confidence in its knowledge about the topic.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MMCUE against text-only uncertainty estimation methods on tasks involving real-world knowledge, such as visual question answering or fact-checking of news articles with associated images. Evaluate using standard calibration metrics, as well as measures of how well the model's uncertainty estimates correlate with actual text-image coherence as judged by humans."

        "Title": "Multi-Modal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation (MMCUE): Leveraging Cross-Modal Alignment for Improved Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on text-only inputs, neglecting the potential for improved calibration through multi-modal coherence analysis. This limitation hinders the ability to accurately assess model confidence, especially in tasks involving real-world knowledge where visual information can provide crucial context.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs are predominantly text-based, failing to capitalize on the rich information available in multi-modal contexts. By assessing the coherence between textual descriptions and associated images, we can potentially achieve more robust uncertainty estimates. This is particularly valuable for tasks involving real-world knowledge, where visual cues can significantly enhance the model's understanding and confidence assessment. Our method, Multi-Modal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation (MMCUE), aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the alignment between text and image modalities to calibrate uncertainty in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "MMCUE operates in three main steps: 1) Given a text query, the LLM is prompted to generate or retrieve relevant image descriptions. 2) These descriptions are presented alongside actual images (some matching, some not), and the model is prompted to assess the coherence between each text-image pair. 3) The model is then guided to use these coherence assessments to calibrate its confidence in the original query. For instance, when answering a question about animal behavior, the model might generate descriptions of relevant scenes, then evaluate how well these align with presented images, using this information to gauge its overall confidence in its knowledge about the topic.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: 1) Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2.0 dataset, which contains open-ended questions about images. 2) A subset of the FEVER dataset for fact-checking, augmented with relevant images sourced from Google Images API. For FEVER, we'll focus on claims that can be visually verified.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 with vision capabilities (GPT-4V) as our primary model, accessed through the OpenAI API. For comparison, we'll also use GPT-3.5-turbo for text-only baselines.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baselines: 1) Text-only: Use GPT-3.5-turbo to answer questions or verify claims without images, and extract confidence scores. 2) Simple Visual: Use GPT-4V to answer or verify with images, but without our coherence-based calibration.",
            "Step 4: MMCUE Implementation": "Implement our proposed method in three stages: a) Image Description Generation: Prompt GPT-4V to generate relevant image descriptions for the query. b) Coherence Assessment: Present these descriptions with actual images (some matching, some not) and prompt GPT-4V to assess coherence. c) Confidence Calibration: Use the coherence assessments to calibrate the final confidence score.",
            "Step 5: Prompts Design": "Design prompts for each stage of MMCUE: a) For image description generation: 'Given the question/claim \"[QUERY]\", generate 3 detailed descriptions of images that would be relevant to answering this question or verifying this claim.' b) For coherence assessment: 'On a scale of 1-10, how well does the following image match this description: [DESCRIPTION]? Explain your rating.' c) For confidence calibration: 'Based on the coherence scores of the image-description pairs, adjust your confidence in your answer to the original query \"[QUERY]\". Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of answers/verifications. 2) Calibration Error: Calculate the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. 3) Brier Score: Assess the quality of probabilistic predictions. 4) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect predictions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare MMCUE against the baselines on all metrics. Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component (image description generation, coherence assessment, confidence calibration) to the overall performance. Analyze cases where MMCUE significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What color is the bird in this image?",
                "Expected Output": "Based on the image provided, the bird appears to be primarily blue in color. It looks like a Blue Jay or a similar species of blue-colored bird. The bird has bright blue feathers covering most of its body, with some white markings visible as well. Without seeing the actual image, I can't be 100% certain, but I'm fairly confident (about 85% sure) that the main color of the bird in question is blue.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a reasonable answer but lacks the ability to verify its response against the actual image, potentially leading to overconfidence or inaccuracies."
            },
            "MMCUE Example": {
                "Step 1 - Image Description Generation": {
                    "Input": "Q: What color is the bird in this image?",
                    "Output": "1. A close-up of a vibrant blue bird with a distinctive crest on its head, perched on a branch against a blurred background.\n2. A small bird with primarily gray feathers and a black cap, sitting on a wooden feeder with seeds visible.\n3. A red cardinal with a bright red plumage and a black face mask, standing on a snow-covered branch."
                },
                "Step 2 - Coherence Assessment": {
                    "Input": "(For each description, present with the actual image) On a scale of 1-10, how well does the following image match this description: [DESCRIPTION]? Explain your rating.",
                    "Output": "Description 1: Coherence score 9/10. The image closely matches the description of a vibrant blue bird with a crest, likely a Blue Jay, perched on a branch.\nDescription 2: Coherence score 2/10. The image does not show a gray bird with a black cap or a feeder.\nDescription 3: Coherence score 1/10. There is no red cardinal or snow-covered branch in the image."
                },
                "Step 3 - Confidence Calibration": {
                    "Input": "Based on the coherence scores of the image-description pairs, adjust your confidence in your answer to the original query \"What color is the bird in this image?\". Explain your reasoning.",
                    "Output": "Based on the coherence assessments, I can confidently state that the bird in the image is blue. The high coherence score (9/10) for the description of a vibrant blue bird, likely a Blue Jay, strongly supports this conclusion. The low coherence scores for other descriptions (gray bird and red cardinal) further reinforce that the bird is indeed blue. Given this evidence, I'm 95% confident that the bird in the image is blue. The slight uncertainty accounts for potential variations in lighting or subtle color nuances that might be present in the actual image."
                },
                "Explanation": "MMCUE demonstrates improved confidence calibration by generating relevant image descriptions, assessing their coherence with the actual image, and using this information to adjust the final confidence score. This process allows for a more nuanced and accurate assessment of the model's certainty in its answer."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MMCUE does not significantly outperform the baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of generated image descriptions to identify if the issue lies in the description generation step. 2) Analyzing the coherence assessment process to ensure it's providing meaningful information. 3) Investigating whether the confidence calibration step is effectively utilizing the coherence information. Based on these findings, we could explore alternative approaches such as: a) Fine-tuning the image description generation process with more specific prompts or by incorporating feedback loops. b) Developing a more sophisticated coherence assessment metric that considers multiple aspects of image-text alignment. c) Exploring different ways of integrating coherence information into the final confidence score, possibly using a learned weighting scheme. Additionally, we could expand the project scope to include an in-depth analysis of when and why multi-modal coherence is most beneficial for uncertainty estimation, potentially identifying specific types of queries or domains where this approach is particularly effective."
