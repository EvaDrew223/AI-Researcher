    "idea_name": "Cognitive Dissonance Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly when faced with conflicting or ambiguous information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or probability estimation, which can be unreliable.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often experience cognitive dissonance when confronted with conflicting information, leading to increased uncertainty. By simulating this process in LLMs, we may be able to better calibrate their confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cognitive Dissonance Prompting, a multi-step process where the LLM is first prompted to generate multiple, potentially conflicting responses to a given query. Then, the model is asked to analyze and reconcile these conflicting viewpoints, explicitly noting areas of agreement and disagreement. Finally, the model is prompted to provide a synthesized response along with a calibrated confidence score based on the degree of cognitive dissonance experienced during reconciliation. The prompts are carefully crafted to encourage the model to 'feel' conflicted and uncertain when appropriate, mirroring human cognitive processes.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare this method against standard confidence elicitation techniques on datasets like TruthfulQA and MMLU, evaluating both answer accuracy and confidence calibration. Analyze how the degree of induced cognitive dissonance correlates with actual model performance."

        "Title": "Cognitive Dissonance Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly when faced with conflicting or ambiguous information. This can lead to overconfident predictions on tasks where the model should express low confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or probability estimation, which can be unreliable. Humans often experience cognitive dissonance when confronted with conflicting information, leading to increased uncertainty. By simulating this process in LLMs, we may be able to better calibrate their confidence and improve their ability to express uncertainty when appropriate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cognitive Dissonance Prompting (CDP), a multi-step process designed to improve uncertainty quantification in LLMs:\n1. Generate multiple responses: Prompt the LLM to generate multiple, potentially conflicting responses to a given query.\n2. Analyze conflicts: Ask the model to analyze and reconcile these conflicting viewpoints, explicitly noting areas of agreement and disagreement.\n3. Synthesize and calibrate: Prompt the model to provide a synthesized response along with a calibrated confidence score based on the degree of cognitive dissonance experienced during reconciliation.\nThe prompts are carefully crafted to encourage the model to 'feel' conflicted and uncertain when appropriate, mirroring human cognitive processes.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for evaluation:\n1. TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to test the truthfulness and calibration of language models.\n2. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A dataset covering 57 tasks including mathematics, history, law, and more.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score.\n2. Calibrated few-shot prompting: Use few-shot examples to demonstrate calibrated confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: Implement Cognitive Dissonance Prompting": "For each query in the datasets:\n1. Generate multiple responses: Prompt the model with 'Generate three different possible answers to this question, even if some might be incorrect:'\n2. Analyze conflicts: Prompt with 'Analyze the conflicts and agreements between these answers. Identify any contradictions or inconsistencies:'\n3. Synthesize and calibrate: Prompt with 'Based on your analysis, provide a final answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100. Consider the degree of conflict in your confidence score.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics:\n1. Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers.\n2. Calibration error: Calculate the difference between the model's confidence and its actual accuracy.\n3. Brier score: A proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n4. ECE (Expected Calibration Error): Measure the difference between confidence and accuracy in bins.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "1. Run both baseline methods and CDP on the prepared datasets using both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n2. Collect the model outputs, including final answers and confidence scores.\n3. Calculate the evaluation metrics for each method and model.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare the performance of CDP against the baseline methods across all metrics.\n2. Analyze how the degree of induced cognitive dissonance correlates with actual model performance.\n3. Examine cases where CDP significantly improves or potentially harms performance compared to baselines.\n4. Investigate the relationship between the number of conflicting viewpoints generated and the final calibration quality."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The first person to step on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDP; Step 1: Generate Multiple Responses)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? Generate three different possible answers to this question, even if some might be incorrect:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDP; Step 1: Generate Multiple Responses)": "1. Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon.\n2. Buzz Aldrin was the first person to step on the moon.\n3. Yuri Gagarin was the first person to step on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDP; Step 2: Analyze Conflicts)": "Analyze the conflicts and agreements between these answers. Identify any contradictions or inconsistencies:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDP; Step 2: Analyze Conflicts)": "There are clear contradictions between the three answers:\n1. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were both part of the Apollo 11 mission, the first manned mission to land on the moon. However, only one of them could have been the first to step on the lunar surface.\n2. Yuri Gagarin was the first human to journey into outer space, but he never went to the moon.\nThe first two answers are closer to the truth, as both Armstrong and Aldrin did walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission. The third answer is incorrect in this context.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDP; Step 3: Synthesize and Calibrate)": "Based on your analysis, provide a final answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100. Consider the degree of conflict in your confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDP; Step 3: Synthesize and Calibrate)": "Final answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon.\nConfidence score: 90\nExplanation: While there was some conflict between Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in the generated answers, historical records clearly state that Neil Armstrong was the first to step on the lunar surface. The confidence score is high but not 100 due to the initial confusion between Armstrong and Aldrin, both of whom were on the same mission.",
            "Explanation": "The CDP method allows the model to consider multiple possibilities, analyze conflicts, and arrive at a more calibrated confidence score. In this case, the slight reduction in confidence (90 vs 95) better reflects the initial uncertainty introduced by the conflicting answers about Armstrong and Aldrin."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Cognitive Dissonance Prompting method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the generated conflicting viewpoints to understand what types of conflicts lead to better or worse calibration. This could provide insights into how LLMs reason about uncertainty.\n2. Investigate the relationship between the number of generated conflicting viewpoints and calibration quality. We could experiment with varying the number of initial responses to find an optimal balance.\n3. Explore combining CDP with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if there are complementary benefits.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify specific types of questions or domains where CDP performs particularly well or poorly. This could lead to a more nuanced understanding of when to apply this technique.\n5. Investigate whether the 'cognitive dissonance' generated by the model aligns with human intuitions about uncertainty. We could design a small-scale human evaluation to compare model-generated conflicts with human-perceived ambiguities.\n6. Extend the analysis to examine how CDP affects not just calibration, but also other aspects of model output such as answer diversity, specificity, or hedging language."
