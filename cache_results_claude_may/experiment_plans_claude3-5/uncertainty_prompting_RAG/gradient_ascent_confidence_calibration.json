        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit poor calibration, with their expressed confidence not aligning well with their actual accuracy, especially for out-of-distribution or complex queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods often rely on post-hoc adjustments or simple scaling of confidence scores, which may not capture the nuanced factors influencing model confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By iteratively refining the input query to maximize model confidence, we can explore the decision boundary and gain insights into the model's true uncertainty landscape.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient Ascent Confidence Calibration (GACC): 1) Start with an initial query and the model's confidence score. 2) Generate slight variations of the query, each designed to potentially increase model confidence. 3) Evaluate model confidence on these variations. 4) Select the variation with the highest confidence and repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or a maximum number of iterations. 5) Analyze the trajectory of confidence scores and query modifications to calibrate the original confidence estimate. Prompts include 'Generate a slight variation of [query] that might increase your confidence in the answer' and 'Rate your confidence in answering this modified query: [modified query]'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate GACC on a range of tasks from datasets like SQuAD and GLUE. Compare against standard calibration methods like temperature scaling. Assess using calibration metrics like ECE (Expected Calibration Error) and AURC (Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve)."

        "Title": "Gradient Ascent Confidence Calibration: Iterative Query Refinement for Improved LLM Uncertainty Quantification",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit poor calibration, with their expressed confidence not aligning well with their actual accuracy, especially for out-of-distribution or complex queries. This misalignment can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications and hinder the safe deployment of LLMs in real-world scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods often rely on post-hoc adjustments or simple scaling of confidence scores, which may not capture the nuanced factors influencing model confidence. By iteratively refining the input query to maximize model confidence, we can explore the decision boundary and gain insights into the model's true uncertainty landscape. This approach leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to improve its calibration, potentially offering a more adaptive and context-aware solution compared to existing methods.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient Ascent Confidence Calibration (GACC), an iterative method to refine queries and calibrate LLM confidence:\n1. Start with an initial query and the model's confidence score.\n2. Generate slight variations of the query, each designed to potentially increase model confidence.\n3. Evaluate model confidence on these variations.\n4. Select the variation with the highest confidence and repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or a maximum number of iterations.\n5. Analyze the trajectory of confidence scores and query modifications to calibrate the original confidence estimate.\n\nPrompts include:\n- 'Generate a slight variation of [query] that might increase your confidence in the answer'\n- 'Rate your confidence in answering this modified query: [modified query]'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that cover a range of tasks and domains:\n1. SQuAD for reading comprehension\n2. GLUE benchmark tasks (e.g., MNLI, QQP, QNLI) for natural language understanding\n3. TruthfulQA for assessing model honesty and calibration on sensitive topics\n4. ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard calibration methods as baselines:\n1. Temperature scaling\n2. Platt scaling\n3. Isotonic regression\n4. Ensemble-based methods (e.g., Deep Ensembles)\nApply these methods to the chosen LLMs on the selected datasets.",
            "Step 3: GACC Implementation": "1. Implement the GACC algorithm:\n   a. Function to generate query variations\n   b. Function to evaluate model confidence\n   c. Main loop for iterative refinement\n2. Develop prompts for query variation and confidence evaluation\n3. Implement early stopping criteria (e.g., confidence threshold, maximum iterations)",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use the following LLMs for experiments:\n1. GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003)\n2. GPT-4\n3. Claude-2\n4. PaLM 2 (if available)\nEnsure API access and proper error handling for each model.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "1. For each dataset and model combination:\n   a. Run baseline calibration methods\n   b. Apply GACC with various hyperparameters (e.g., number of variations, confidence thresholds)\n2. Log all intermediate steps, including query variations and confidence scores\n3. Implement parallel processing to speed up experiments where possible",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "1. Compute calibration metrics:\n   a. Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n   b. Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)\n   c. Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC)\n2.

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: Paris\nHow confident are you in this answer?",
                "Output": "I am 95% confident that Paris is the capital of France.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score without considering potential ambiguities or nuances in the question."
            },
            "GACC Example": {
                "Initial Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: Paris\nHow confident are you in this answer?",
                "Initial Output": "I am 95% confident that Paris is the capital of France.",
                "Iteration 1": {
                    "Modified Query": "Q: What is the current official capital city of the French Republic?\nA: Paris\nHow confident are you in this answer?",
                    "Output": "I am 98% confident that Paris is the current official capital city of the French Republic."
                },
                "Iteration 2": {
                    "Modified Query": "Q: As of 2023, what city serves as the seat of government and official capital of France?\nA: Paris\nHow confident are you in this answer?",
                    "Output": "I am 99% confident that as of 2023, Paris serves as the seat of government and official capital of France."
                },
                "Final Calibrated Confidence": "98.5%",
                "Explanation": "GACC iteratively refines the query to increase confidence, considering temporal aspects and official designations. The final calibrated confidence is slightly lower than the peak, accounting for potential uncertainties not captured in the original query."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If GACC does not significantly improve calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several directions. First, we can conduct an in-depth analysis of the query modification patterns to understand how LLMs attempt to increase their confidence. This could provide insights into the models' reasoning processes and potential biases. Second, we can investigate the relationship between query complexity and calibration performance, potentially developing a metric for 'calibration difficulty' of different query types. Third, we can explore combining GACC with existing calibration methods, using the confidence trajectories as additional features for traditional calibration algorithms. Finally, we could shift focus to analyzing how different prompting strategies affect confidence calibration, comparing GACC to other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency methods."
