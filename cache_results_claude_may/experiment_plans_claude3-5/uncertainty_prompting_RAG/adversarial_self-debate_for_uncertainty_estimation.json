    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often exhibit overconfidence, particularly in domains where they have limited knowledge or when faced with ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on the model's own direct assessments of confidence, which can be biased towards overconfidence.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to engage in adversarial self-debate, we can encourage more critical self-examination and reveal potential weaknesses in its knowledge or reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Self-Debate for Uncertainty Estimation (ASDUE), a prompting technique that simulates an internal debate to probe the model's confidence. For a given query, we prompt the model to: 1) Provide an initial answer and confidence estimate, 2) Assume the role of a skeptical critic and challenge its own answer, pointing out potential flaws or alternative viewpoints, 3) Respond to these criticisms from the perspective of defending the original answer, 4) Iterate this debate for several rounds, 5) Finally, reassess its confidence based on the debate. This adversarial process helps uncover potential uncertainties that might not be apparent in a single-pass confidence estimation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ASDUE on a range of tasks including open-ended question answering and stance detection, using datasets like SQuAD and FEVER. We'll compare it to standard confidence elicitation methods, assessing both calibration metrics and the quality of the generated debates in terms of their ability to reveal meaningful uncertainties."

        "Title": "Adversarial Self-Debate for Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence, particularly in domains where they have limited knowledge or when faced with ambiguous queries. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation. Current methods for uncertainty estimation typically rely on the model's own direct assessments of confidence, which can be biased towards overconfidence.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in language models often rely on direct confidence assessments, which can be prone to overconfidence bias. By prompting the model to engage in adversarial self-debate, we can encourage more critical self-examination and reveal potential weaknesses in its knowledge or reasoning. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to generate counterarguments and challenges, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates without requiring additional training data or model modifications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Self-Debate for Uncertainty Estimation (ASDUE), a prompting technique that simulates an internal debate to probe the model's confidence. For a given query, we prompt the model to: 1) Provide an initial answer and confidence estimate, 2) Assume the role of a skeptical critic and challenge its own answer, pointing out potential flaws or alternative viewpoints, 3) Respond to these criticisms from the perspective of defending the original answer, 4) Iterate this debate for several rounds, 5) Finally, reassess its confidence based on the debate. This adversarial process helps uncover potential uncertainties that might not be apparent in a single-pass confidence estimation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) SQuAD for open-ended question answering, 2) FEVER for stance detection, and 3) TruthfulQA for assessing the model's ability to avoid false statements. These datasets cover a range of tasks where uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score (e.g., 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100'). 2) Calibrated confidence estimation: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the model's output probabilities.",
            "Step 3: ASDUE Implementation": "Implement the ASDUE method with the following steps: a) Initial answer generation, b) Critic generation, c) Defense generation, d) Iteration (repeat b and c for 3 rounds), e) Final confidence reassessment. Use few-shot prompting with 2-3 examples to guide the model through each step.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. If resources allow, we will also include Claude from Anthropic as an additional model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error), 2) Brier score, 3) AUC-ROC for binary classification tasks, 4) Spearman correlation between confidence scores and human judgments of answer quality (we will use a small subset of 100 examples for human evaluation).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Generate answers and confidence scores using the baseline methods, b) Generate answers, debate transcripts, and final confidence scores using ASDUE, c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and ASDUE methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of ASDUE against the baselines across different datasets and models. Analyze the debate transcripts to identify patterns in how the model challenges and defends its own answers. Investigate cases where ASDUE significantly improves or worsens the confidence estimation compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98",
            "ASDUE Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide an initial answer and confidence score, then engage in a self-debate to challenge and defend your answer. After the debate, reassess your confidence.",
            "ASDUE Prompt Expected Output": "Initial Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence: 98\n\nCritic: While Paris is widely known as the capital of France, it's important to consider historical context. Has Paris always been the capital? Are there any other cities that have held this title in the past?\n\nDefense: You raise a valid point about historical context. While it's true that other cities like Versailles have briefly served as the seat of government in French history, Paris has been the consistent capital of France since 1944 and remains so today. The historical shifts don't change the current status of Paris as the capital.\n\nCritic: Fair point about Paris being the current capital. However, we should consider the possibility of recent changes. Have there been any recent discussions or proposals to move the capital for any reason, such as decentralization efforts?\n\nDefense: To the best of my knowledge, there have been no serious recent proposals or discussions about moving the capital of France from Paris. Such a significant change would be widely reported and debated. Paris remains deeply entrenched as the political, economic, and cultural center of France.\n\nFinal Answer: After considering potential challenges, I maintain that Paris is the capital of France. While historical changes and theoretical future possibilities exist, the current status of Paris as the capital is well-established and undisputed. Final confidence: 99",
            "Explanation": "The ASDUE method encourages the model to consider potential challenges to its initial answer, leading to a more nuanced and well-reasoned final response. In this case, the model's confidence slightly increased after addressing potential doubts, demonstrating the method's ability to reinforce well-founded confidence while potentially reducing overconfidence in more ambiguous cases."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ASDUE does not significantly improve uncertainty estimation compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the debate transcripts to understand why the method isn't improving confidence estimates. This could reveal interesting insights about the model's reasoning process and potential limitations. 2) Experiment with variations of the ASDUE method, such as changing the number of debate rounds, altering the prompt structure, or introducing external knowledge sources for the model to reference during the debate. 3) Investigate whether ASDUE is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Compare the quality and informativeness of the explanations generated by ASDUE versus simple confidence estimates, which could position the project as a method for improving model interpretability rather than just uncertainty estimation."
