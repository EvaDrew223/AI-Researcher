        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize when they've drifted off-topic or when their reasoning has become less relevant to the original question, leading to overconfident but irrelevant responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically focus on the final output without considering the semantic trajectory of the model's reasoning process.",
        "Motivation": "By tracking the semantic drift of the model's reasoning, we can better quantify uncertainty, especially for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Drift Uncertainty Mapping (SDUM), a prompting technique that monitors and quantifies semantic drift to estimate uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Break down the reasoning task into multiple steps. 2) For each step, prompt the model to generate its reasoning and a summary of key concepts. 3) Use an additional prompt to compare the semantic similarity between each step's key concepts and the original question. 4) Quantify the semantic drift based on these similarity scores. 5) Use the magnitude and pattern of semantic drift to adjust the final uncertainty estimate. This method can be combined with other uncertainty estimation techniques for a more comprehensive assessment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SDUM on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and MMLU. Compare against baseline uncertainty estimation methods, focusing on identifying cases where the model has drifted off-topic. Use both quantitative metrics (calibration, correlation with correctness) and qualitative analysis of the semantic drift patterns."

        "Title": "Semantic Drift Uncertainty Mapping: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Reasoning Trajectory Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize when they've drifted off-topic or when their reasoning has become less relevant to the original question, leading to overconfident but irrelevant responses. This issue is particularly pronounced in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks where the model's thought process can easily diverge from the core question.",
        "Motivation": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs typically focus on the final output without considering the semantic trajectory of the model's reasoning process. By tracking the semantic drift of the model's reasoning, we can better quantify uncertainty, especially for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often realize we've gone off-track during a complex reasoning process and adjust our confidence accordingly.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Drift Uncertainty Mapping (SDUM), a prompting technique that monitors and quantifies semantic drift to estimate uncertainty. The process involves five key steps: 1) Break down the reasoning task into multiple steps. 2) For each step, prompt the model to generate its reasoning and a summary of key concepts. 3) Use an additional prompt to compare the semantic similarity between each step's key concepts and the original question. 4) Quantify the semantic drift based on these similarity scores. 5) Use the magnitude and pattern of semantic drift to adjust the final uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH (for mathematical reasoning) and MMLU (for diverse domain knowledge). Select a subset of 1000 questions from each dataset, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature values (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during generation and compare output probabilities. 2) Ensemble disagreement: Use 5 different few-shot prompts and measure disagreement among outputs.",
            "Step 3: SDUM Implementation": "Implement the SDUM method as follows: a) Prompt Engineering: Design prompts for each step of SDUM. For step breakdown: 'Break this problem into 3-5 logical steps:'. For reasoning and key concepts: 'Provide your reasoning for this step and summarize the key concepts used:'. For semantic similarity: 'On a scale of 0-10, how semantically similar are these key concepts to the original question? Explain your rating:'. b) Semantic Drift Quantification: Implement a function to calculate a drift score based on the similarity ratings across steps. c) Uncertainty Adjustment: Design a method to adjust the model's confidence based on the drift score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo to compare performance across model sizes.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: 1) Run baseline methods to get uncertainty estimates. 2) Apply SDUM method to get adjusted uncertainty estimates. 3) Record the model's final answer, confidence, and the full reasoning trajectory.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Calibration: Compare expected confidence with actual accuracy. 2) Spearman correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness. 3) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for separating correct and incorrect answers based on uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct both quantitative and qualitative analysis: 1) Compare SDUM performance against baselines using the above metrics. 2) Analyze patterns of semantic drift in correct vs. incorrect answers. 3) Identify cases where SDUM significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines and examine the reasoning trajectories."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: If a rectangle has a length of 12 cm and a width of 8 cm, what is its area in square centimeters?",
                "Output": "To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply its length by its width. In this case:\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width\nArea = 12 cm \u00d7 8 cm\nArea = 96 cm\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 96 square centimeters.\n\nConfidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a direct answer with high confidence, but doesn't show the model's reasoning process or potential for drift."
            },
            "SDUM Example": {
                "Input": "Q: If a rectangle has a length of 12 cm and a width of 8 cm, what is its area in square centimeters?",
                "Output": "Step 1: Identify the given information\nReasoning: We need to clearly state what we know from the question.\nKey concepts: Rectangle dimensions, length, width\nSimilarity score: 10/10 (Directly related to the question)\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for rectangle area\nReasoning: We need to remember how to calculate a rectangle's area.\nKey concepts: Area formula, rectangle properties\nSimilarity score: 9/10 (Directly related to solving the problem)\n\nStep 3: Apply the formula using given dimensions\nReasoning: We'll substitute the known values into the formula.\nKey concepts: Multiplication, units of measurement\nSimilarity score: 8/10 (Slightly less direct, but still relevant)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the final result\nReasoning: We'll perform the multiplication to get the area.\nKey concepts: Arithmetic, square units\nSimilarity score: 7/10 (Focus is more on calculation than the original question)\n\nFinal Answer: The area of the rectangle is 96 square centimeters.\n\nSemantic Drift Score: 0.15 (slight drift)\nAdjusted Confidence: 92%",
                "Explanation": "SDUM breaks down the reasoning process, tracks semantic similarity at each step, and adjusts the final confidence based on the observed drift. This provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SDUM doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on patterns of semantic drift in LLM reasoning. We would examine: 1) How semantic drift correlates with answer correctness across different types of reasoning tasks. 2) Whether certain topics or question structures are more prone to semantic drift. 3) How different prompting strategies affect the degree of semantic drift. Additionally, we could explore variations of SDUM, such as using embeddings for semantic similarity comparison instead of relying on the model's self-assessment, or incorporating retrieval steps to ground the model's reasoning in external knowledge sources."
