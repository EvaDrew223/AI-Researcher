        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex reasoning tasks that involve multiple interrelated concepts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like ensemble methods or dropout-based uncertainty estimation often treat concepts independently.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts consider how uncertainties in different concepts influence each other when assessing overall confidence. Modeling these conceptual dependencies could lead to more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Entanglement Prompting (CEP), which explicitly models how uncertainties in different concepts influence each other. Given a query, CEP first decomposes it into constituent concepts. For each concept pair, it then generates prompts to explore how uncertainty in one affects the other (e.g. \"If we're unsure about X, how does that impact our certainty about Y?\"). These pairwise influences are aggregated into a conceptual uncertainty graph. Finally, graph propagation algorithms are used to compute a holistic uncertainty score that accounts for concept interdependencies.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CEP against standard uncertainty estimation methods on multi-hop reasoning datasets like HotpotQA. Evaluate using calibration metrics and human expert judgments of uncertainty realism."

        "Title": "Conceptual Entanglement Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex reasoning tasks that involve multiple interrelated concepts. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions on tasks where the model's knowledge is incomplete or uncertain, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like ensemble methods or dropout-based uncertainty estimation often treat concepts independently, failing to capture the complex interdependencies between different aspects of a problem. In contrast, human experts consider how uncertainties in different concepts influence each other when assessing overall confidence. By modeling these conceptual dependencies, we aim to achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification in LLMs, leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Entanglement Prompting (CEP), which explicitly models how uncertainties in different concepts influence each other. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Concept Decomposition: Given a query, CEP first decomposes it into constituent concepts. 2) Pairwise Influence Prompting: For each concept pair, it generates prompts to explore how uncertainty in one affects the other. 3) Uncertainty Graph Construction: These pairwise influences are aggregated into a conceptual uncertainty graph. 4) Holistic Uncertainty Computation: Graph propagation algorithms are used to compute a holistic uncertainty score that accounts for concept interdependencies.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the HotpotQA dataset, which contains multi-hop reasoning questions. This dataset is suitable for our task as it involves complex reasoning across multiple concepts. We will use a subset of 1000 questions for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting with confidence score request, b) Ensemble method using multiple LLM calls, c) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models).",
            "Step 3: CEP Implementation": "Implement the four steps of Conceptual Entanglement Prompting: a) Concept Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to identify key concepts in each question. b) Pairwise Influence Prompting: Generate prompts for each concept pair to assess their interdependencies. c) Uncertainty Graph Construction: Aggregate pairwise influences into a graph structure. d) Holistic Uncertainty Computation: Apply graph propagation algorithms to compute final uncertainty scores.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. We will also test with GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare CEP against baseline methods using the following metrics: a) Calibration error (expected vs. actual accuracy), b) Brier score, c) Area under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR), d) Human evaluation of uncertainty realism on a subset of 100 questions.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component: a) Compare with a version that doesn't use pairwise influence prompting, b) Test different graph propagation algorithms, c) Vary the number of concepts considered in decomposition.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform qualitative analysis on cases where CEP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. Examine the generated concept decompositions and pairwise influence assessments to gain insights into the method's strengths and weaknesses."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a head office in what city?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: New Delhi\nConfidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Concept Decomposition)": "Decompose the following question into its key concepts: 'The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a head office in what city?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Concept Decomposition)": "1. Oberoi family\n2. Hotel company\n3. Head office location",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Pairwise Influence)": "How does uncertainty about the 'Oberoi family' affect our certainty about the 'head office location' of their hotel company?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Pairwise Influence)": "Uncertainty about the Oberoi family could significantly affect our certainty about the head office location. If we're unsure about the specific branch of the Oberoi family involved in the hotel business, it might lead to uncertainty about which particular Oberoi-owned hotel company we're referring to, and consequently, uncertainty about the head office location. The influence is strong because different branches of the family or different Oberoi-owned companies might have head offices in different cities.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Final Answer and Uncertainty)": "Based on the concept decomposition and pairwise influences analyzed, what is the answer to the question 'The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a head office in what city?' and what is the overall uncertainty in this answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Final Answer and Uncertainty)": "Answer: New Delhi\nUncertainty: Medium (60% confident)\nExplanation: While it's likely that the head office is in New Delhi, as it's a major city in India and the Oberoi Group (the most well-known Oberoi family hotel company) is headquartered there, there's significant uncertainty due to potential confusion between different Oberoi-owned companies or branches of the family. The uncertainty in identifying the specific company in question propagates to uncertainty about the head office location.",
            "Explanation": "CEP provides a more nuanced uncertainty assessment by considering the interdependencies between concepts. The baseline method might give a higher confidence based solely on the association between Oberoi and New Delhi, while CEP recognizes that uncertainty about which specific Oberoi company is being referred to affects the certainty of the head office location."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CEP doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the concept decompositions and pairwise influences to understand why the method isn't capturing uncertainty effectively. This could lead to insights about how LLMs reason about uncertainty. 2) Explore alternative graph structures or propagation algorithms that might better capture concept interdependencies. 3) Investigate whether CEP performs better on certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Combine CEP with other uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., ensembles) to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 5) If the method shows promise but needs refinement, we could focus on improving specific components, such as the concept decomposition step or the pairwise influence assessment."
