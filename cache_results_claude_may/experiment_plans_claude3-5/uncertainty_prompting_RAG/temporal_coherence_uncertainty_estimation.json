        "Problem": "Large language models often produce inconsistent uncertainty estimates when reasoning about temporal sequences or events that unfold over time, leading to unreliable confidence in predictions about past, present, and future states.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on uncertainty estimation for individual time points or static scenarios, neglecting the temporal dynamics of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of temporal coherence in physics and signal processing, we aim to develop a method that captures how uncertainty evolves and propagates through time in language model predictions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation (TCUE), a prompting technique that leverages the model's ability to reason about time to produce coherent uncertainty estimates across temporal sequences. TCUE works by: 1) Temporal Decomposition: Breaking down the input into a sequence of time points or events. 2) Uncertainty Propagation: Prompting the model to estimate uncertainty at each time point while considering how uncertainty from previous points affects the current estimate. 3) Coherence Enforcement: Introducing constraints in the prompt that encourage the model to maintain logical consistency in its uncertainty estimates across time. 4) Temporal Integration: Combining the point estimates into a coherent uncertainty trajectory that respects the causal structure of the events. TCUE also includes a mechanism for handling branching timelines and counterfactual scenarios, allowing for more nuanced uncertainty estimation in complex temporal reasoning tasks.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TCUE on tasks that involve temporal reasoning, such as story completion, event prediction, and historical fact verification. We'll compare it to standard uncertainty estimation methods and assess its performance on maintaining consistency across time points, handling temporal dependencies, and adapting to different time scales. We'll introduce new metrics for measuring temporal coherence in uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models for Time-Dependent Reasoning",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often produce inconsistent uncertainty estimates when reasoning about temporal sequences or events that unfold over time, leading to unreliable confidence in predictions about past, present, and future states. This inconsistency hampers the models' ability to accurately represent their knowledge and limitations across different time points, potentially leading to erroneous decision-making in time-sensitive applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in language models typically focus on static scenarios or individual time points, neglecting the temporal dynamics of uncertainty. Inspired by the concept of temporal coherence in physics and signal processing, we aim to develop a method that captures how uncertainty evolves and propagates through time in language model predictions. This approach is motivated by the observation that uncertainty in real-world scenarios often has a temporal structure, where past events influence future uncertainties. By incorporating this temporal coherence, we expect to achieve more reliable and consistent uncertainty estimates across time-dependent reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Estimation (TCUE), a prompting technique that leverages the model's ability to reason about time to produce coherent uncertainty estimates across temporal sequences. TCUE works through the following steps: 1) Temporal Decomposition: Break down the input into a sequence of time points or events. 2) Uncertainty Propagation: Prompt the model to estimate uncertainty at each time point while considering how uncertainty from previous points affects the current estimate. 3) Coherence Enforcement: Introduce constraints in the prompt that encourage the model to maintain logical consistency in its uncertainty estimates across time. 4) Temporal Integration: Combine the point estimates into a coherent uncertainty trajectory that respects the causal structure of the events. TCUE also includes a mechanism for handling branching timelines and counterfactual scenarios, allowing for more nuanced uncertainty estimation in complex temporal reasoning tasks.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for evaluation: 1) TimeQA: a dataset of time-dependent questions and answers. 2) NarrativeQA: for evaluating story completion tasks with temporal elements. 3) ForecastQA: a dataset for evaluating predictions about future events. For each dataset, we will annotate a subset of questions with ground truth uncertainty labels at different time points.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard uncertainty estimation: Use temperature scaling or Monte Carlo dropout to estimate uncertainty for each question independently. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with uncertainty: Append 'Let's approach this step by step, and for each step, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100' to each prompt.",
            "Step 3: TCUE Implementation": "Implement the TCUE method with the following components: 1) Temporal Decomposition: 'Break down the given scenario into a sequence of key time points or events.' 2) Uncertainty Propagation: 'For each time point, estimate the uncertainty and explain how it relates to the previous time points.' 3) Coherence Enforcement: 'Ensure that your uncertainty estimates are logically consistent across time. If there are any inconsistencies, explain and resolve them.' 4) Temporal Integration: 'Provide a final uncertainty estimate that takes into account the entire temporal sequence.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method, we will evaluate: 1) Accuracy of predictions. 2) Calibration of uncertainty estimates using Expected Calibration Error (ECE). 3) Temporal consistency using a new metric we call Temporal Uncertainty Coherence (TUC), which measures the logical consistency of uncertainty estimates across time points. 4) Qualitative analysis of the generated reasoning chains and uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing each component of TCUE (temporal decomposition, uncertainty propagation, coherence enforcement, temporal integration) to assess their individual contributions to the overall performance.",
            "Step 7: Analysis of Results": "Compare the performance of TCUE against the baselines across all metrics. Analyze how TCUE performs on different types of temporal reasoning tasks (e.g., interpolation vs. extrapolation). Investigate cases where TCUE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Uncertainty Estimation)": "Q: In the story of Little Red Riding Hood, at what point is the grandmother in the most danger? Provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Uncertainty Estimation)": "Answer: The grandmother is in the most danger when the wolf arrives at her house and eats her. Confidence: 85",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought with Uncertainty)": "Q: In the story of Little Red Riding Hood, at what point is the grandmother in the most danger? Let's approach this step by step, and for each step, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought with Uncertainty)": "1. The wolf learns about the grandmother's location (Confidence: 90)\n2. The wolf decides to go to the grandmother's house (Confidence: 95)\n3. The wolf arrives at the grandmother's house (Confidence: 98)\n4. The wolf enters the house and confronts the grandmother (Confidence: 99)\n5. The wolf eats the grandmother (Confidence: 100)\n\nFinal Answer: The grandmother is in the most danger when the wolf enters her house and confronts her, just before eating her. This is the point of maximum danger because it's the moment when the threat is imminent and the grandmother has no chance of escape.\n\nOverall Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUE)": "Q: In the story of Little Red Riding Hood, analyze the danger level for the grandmother throughout the story. Break down the scenario into a sequence of key time points or events. For each time point, estimate the uncertainty in the danger level and explain how it relates to the previous time points. Ensure that your uncertainty estimates are logically consistent across time. If there are any inconsistencies, explain and resolve them. Finally, provide a conclusion about when the grandmother is in the most danger, with a final uncertainty estimate that takes into account the entire temporal sequence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUE)": "Temporal Decomposition:\n1. Little Red Riding Hood leaves for grandmother's house\n2. The wolf learns about the grandmother\n3. The wolf arrives at grandmother's house\n4. The wolf enters the house\n5. The wolf confronts the grandmother\n6. The wolf eats the grandmother\n7. The hunter arrives\n\nUncertainty Propagation and Coherence Enforcement:\n1. Little Red Riding Hood leaves: Danger level - Low, Uncertainty: 10%\n   (No direct threat to grandmother yet)\n\n2. Wolf learns about grandmother: Danger level - Moderate, Uncertainty: 30%\n   (Threat exists but not imminent. Uncertainty increases as the wolf's intentions are not fully known)\n\n3. Wolf arrives at house: Danger level - High, Uncertainty: 20%\n   (Threat is near. Uncertainty decreases as the wolf's intentions become clearer)\n\n4. Wolf enters house: Danger level - Very High, Uncertainty: 15%\n   (Imminent threat. Uncertainty further decreases as the situation unfolds)\n\n5. Wolf confronts grandmother: Danger level - Extreme, Uncertainty: 10%\n   (Direct confrontation. Very low uncertainty about the danger)\n\n6. Wolf eats grandmother: Danger level - Maximum, Uncertainty: 5%\n   (The worst outcome has occurred. Very low uncertainty)\n\n7. Hunter arrives: Danger level - Low (for grandmother), Uncertainty: 25%\n   (Uncertainty increases slightly due to potential for rescue, but grandmother's fate is likely sealed)\n\nTemporal Integration:\nThe danger level for the grandmother increases consistently throughout the story, with uncertainty generally decreasing as events unfold. The point of maximum danger with the lowest uncertainty is when the wolf eats the grandmother.\n\nConclusion:\nThe grandmother is in the most danger when the wolf eats her (time point 6). At this point, the danger level is at its maximum, and the uncertainty is at its lowest (5%) because the worst outcome has occurred. The temporal sequence shows a clear progression of increasing danger and decreasing uncertainty, which is logically consistent with the unfolding of events in the story.\n\nFinal Uncertainty Estimate: 5% (Very High Confidence in this assessment)",
            "explanation": "The TCUE method provides a more nuanced and temporally coherent analysis of the uncertainty in the danger level for the grandmother throughout the story. It breaks down the scenario into key time points, estimates uncertainty at each point while considering previous events, ensures logical consistency across time, and provides a final integrated assessment. This approach offers a more comprehensive and reliable uncertainty estimation compared to the baselines, which either provide a single point estimate or lack the temporal coherence aspect."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCUE method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This analysis will include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of the temporal decompositions generated by the model. 2) Assessing whether the uncertainty propagation step is effectively capturing the temporal dependencies between events. 3) Investigating if the coherence enforcement constraints are too strict or too loose, potentially leading to suboptimal results. 4) Analyzing how well the model is performing the temporal integration step. Based on these findings, we may modify the TCUE method, for example, by providing more structured prompts for each step or by incorporating a meta-learning approach where the model learns to improve its temporal reasoning over multiple iterations. Additionally, we could explore combining TCUE with other uncertainty estimation techniques or investigate its performance on different types of language models to gain insights into its generalizability. If these modifications do not yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of why temporal coherence in uncertainty estimation is challenging for current language models, potentially uncovering important limitations or areas for future research in time-dependent reasoning tasks."
