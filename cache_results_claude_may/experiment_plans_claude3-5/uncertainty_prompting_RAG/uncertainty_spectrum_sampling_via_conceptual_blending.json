    "idea_name": "Uncertainty Spectrum Sampling via Conceptual Blending",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often rely on simplistic measures like token probabilities or single-point estimates, failing to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty across different conceptual domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Traditional approaches include using softmax probabilities, ensemble methods, or asking models to directly verbalize their confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the human ability to blend concepts from different domains to reason about uncertainty, we propose a method that samples across a spectrum of conceptually blended scenarios to better quantify model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Sampling via Conceptual Blending (USS-CB). First, we prompt the LLM to generate a set of diverse conceptual domains related to the query. Then, we use another prompt to blend these domains, creating a spectrum of hybrid scenarios. We sample responses across this spectrum, analyzing how the model's answers and expressed confidence vary. Finally, we aggregate these samples to construct a multi-dimensional uncertainty profile, capturing nuances across different conceptual blendings.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare USS-CB against baseline methods on diverse tasks including open-ended question answering, fact verification, and reasoning problems. Evaluate using calibration metrics, area under the confidence-error curve, and human expert assessment of uncertainty profiles."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Spectrum Sampling via Conceptual Blending: A Novel Approach to Quantifying LLM Uncertainty",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic measures like token probabilities or single-point estimates, failing to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty across different conceptual domains. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret the confidence of LLMs in various tasks, potentially leading to misinterpretation of model outputs and unreliable decision-making based on these outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for quantifying uncertainty in LLMs, such as using softmax probabilities, ensemble methods, or direct verbalization of confidence, often fall short in capturing the nuanced and multi-faceted nature of uncertainty. These approaches typically provide a one-dimensional view of uncertainty, which may not reflect the true complexity of the model's knowledge and reasoning process. Inspired by the human ability to blend concepts from different domains to reason about uncertainty, we propose a method that samples across a spectrum of conceptually blended scenarios to better quantify model uncertainty. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of LLM uncertainty, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Sampling via Conceptual Blending (USS-CB), a novel method for quantifying uncertainty in LLMs. The process involves the following steps: 1) Generate Conceptual Domains: Prompt the LLM to generate a set of diverse conceptual domains related to the query. 2) Blend Concepts: Use another prompt to blend these domains, creating a spectrum of hybrid scenarios. 3) Sample Responses: Generate responses across this spectrum of blended concepts. 4) Analyze Variation: Examine how the model's answers and expressed confidence vary across the spectrum. 5) Construct Uncertainty Profile: Aggregate these samples to build a multi-dimensional uncertainty profile that captures nuances across different conceptual blendings.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering open-ended question answering (e.g., TruthfulQA), fact verification (e.g., FEVER), and reasoning problems (e.g., GSM8K). Ensure a mix of questions with varying levels of difficulty and domain specificity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement baseline uncertainty quantification methods: a) Softmax probabilities, b) Ensemble method (using different seeds or model versions), c) Direct confidence verbalization.",
            "Step 3: USS-CB Implementation": "Implement the USS-CB method: a) Conceptual Domain Generation: Prompt: 'Given the question \"[QUESTION]\", generate 5 diverse conceptual domains related to this query.' b) Concept Blending: Prompt: 'Blend the following conceptual domains: [DOMAINS]. Create a spectrum of 5 hybrid scenarios ranging from closely related to distantly related to the original question.' c) Response Sampling: For each blended scenario, prompt: 'Based on the blended scenario \"[SCENARIO]\", answer the original question \"[QUESTION]\" and provide your confidence level (0-100%).' d) Variation Analysis: Compute statistical measures (mean, variance, etc.) of answers and confidence levels across the spectrum. e) Uncertainty Profile Construction: Aggregate the samples into a multi-dimensional representation, potentially using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE for visualization.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI API for the main experiments. Additionally, test with open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare USS-CB against baselines using: a) Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), b) Area Under the Confidence-Error Curve, c) Human expert assessment of uncertainty profiles (recruit 3-5 domain experts to rate the quality and interpretability of uncertainty profiles).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis: a) Compare performance across different task types, b) Analyze how conceptual blending affects uncertainty estimates, c) Investigate correlations between uncertainty profiles and actual model performance."

            "USS-CB Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 1 Output": "Conceptual Domains: 1) European Geography, 2) French History, 3) Global Politics, 4) Urban Planning, 5) Cultural Landmarks",

                "Step 4 & 5 Output": "Uncertainty Profile: Mean Confidence: 92.6%, Variance: 14.3, Conceptual Consistency: High",
                "Explanation": "USS-CB provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty, showing how confidence varies across different conceptual blendings, potentially revealing subtle uncertainties not captured by baseline methods."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If USS-CB does not significantly outperform baselines, we will pivot to an in-depth analysis of why conceptual blending fails to capture additional uncertainty information. This could involve: 1) Analyzing the quality and diversity of generated conceptual domains and blended scenarios. 2) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from USS-CB than others. 3) Exploring alternative blending strategies or sampling methods. 4) Conducting ablation studies to identify which components of USS-CB contribute most to its performance. 5) Comparing USS-CB's uncertainty profiles with human-generated uncertainty assessments to identify discrepancies and potential areas for improvement. This analysis could lead to insights about the nature of uncertainty in LLMs and how it relates to conceptual understanding, potentially informing future research directions in LLM uncertainty quantification."
