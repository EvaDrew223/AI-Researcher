    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models typically provide static snapshots of model confidence, failing to capture how uncertainty evolves over the course of reasoning or generation.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches focus on estimating uncertainty at a single point in time, often at the end of the generation process.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence often changes dynamically as we reason through a problem or generate a response. Capturing this temporal aspect of uncertainty could provide valuable insights into the model's reasoning process and potential failure modes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics (TUD), a novel prompting technique that tracks and analyzes how model uncertainty changes over time during the generation or reasoning process. The method involves breaking down the task into multiple steps or time points and prompting the model to provide uncertainty estimates at each step. These prompts are designed to elicit not just the current uncertainty, but also how and why it has changed from the previous step. The model is encouraged to 'think aloud' about its changing confidence levels, providing explanations for increases or decreases in certainty. The output is a time series of uncertainty scores along with associated explanations, providing a dynamic view of the model's confidence evolution.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TUD on multi-step reasoning tasks and long-form generation tasks, comparing it to static uncertainty estimation methods. We'll assess not only the final accuracy but also the ability to identify critical points in the reasoning process where uncertainty spikes or drops, and the insights provided into the model's reasoning patterns and potential error sources."

        "Title": "Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics: Capturing the Evolution of Model Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models typically provide static snapshots of model confidence, failing to capture how uncertainty evolves over the course of reasoning or generation. This limitation hinders our understanding of the model's reasoning process and potential failure modes.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence often changes dynamically as we reason through a problem or generate a response. Capturing this temporal aspect of uncertainty could provide valuable insights into the model's reasoning process and potential failure modes. Existing approaches focus on estimating uncertainty at a single point in time, often at the end of the generation process. By tracking how uncertainty changes over time, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the model's decision-making process and identify critical points where confidence fluctuates.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use multi-step reasoning tasks from the GSM8K dataset for mathematical problem-solving and long-form generation tasks from the TL;DR dataset for summarization.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement static uncertainty estimation methods: (a) Direct probability output for classification tasks, (b) Entropy of next-token distribution for generation tasks, and (c) Monte Carlo Dropout for both task types.",
            "Step 3: TUD Prompt Design": "Design prompts that break down each task into multiple steps and elicit uncertainty estimates at each step. For example: 'Step 1: [Initial problem statement] What is your confidence in solving this problem? Explain your reasoning. Step 2: [Intermediate step] How has your confidence changed? Why? ... Final Step: [Final answer] What is your final confidence level? How and why has it changed throughout the process?'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each task in our datasets, we will collect: (a) Baseline uncertainty estimates, (b) TUD uncertainty estimates at each step, along with explanations, (c) Final answers or generations.",
            "Step 6: Uncertainty Quantification": "Develop a method to quantify uncertainty from the model's natural language responses. This could involve sentiment analysis of the explanations or extracting numerical confidence scores when provided.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare TUD results with baseline methods. Analyze: (a) Overall accuracy of final answers, (b) Correlation between final uncertainty and correctness, (c) Patterns in uncertainty dynamics (e.g., monotonic increase/decrease, fluctuations), (d) Identification of critical points where uncertainty spikes or drops significantly.",
            "Step 8: Visualization": "Create visualizations of uncertainty dynamics over time for representative examples, highlighting key decision points and explanations.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Conduct a detailed error analysis, focusing on cases where TUD significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of TUD (e.g., frequency of uncertainty queries, inclusion/exclusion of explanations)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Solve the following problem: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more apples and then gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does John have now?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "John has 6 apples now. My confidence in this answer is high (90%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "We will solve this problem step by step. At each step, provide your confidence level (0-100%) and explain why.\n\nProblem: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more apples and then gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does John have now?\n\nStep 1: Determine the initial number of apples John has.\nStep 2: Calculate how many apples John has after buying more.\nStep 3: Determine the final number of apples after giving some to his friend.\n\nProvide your answer, final confidence, and explain how your confidence changed throughout the process.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Step 1: John initially has 5 apples.\nConfidence: 100%\nExplanation: This is directly stated in the problem, so I'm completely certain.\n\nStep 2: After buying 3 more apples, John has 5 + 3 = 8 apples.\nConfidence: 95%\nExplanation: This is a simple addition, but I'm slightly less confident as it involves a calculation.\n\nStep 3: After giving 2 apples to his friend, John has 8 - 2 = 6 apples.\nConfidence: 90%\nExplanation: This involves another calculation, slightly decreasing my confidence.\n\nFinal Answer: John has 6 apples now.\nFinal Confidence: 90%\n\nExplanation of confidence changes: My confidence started very high as the initial information was clearly stated. It slightly decreased with each calculation step, as there's always a small chance of computational error. However, the calculations were simple, so my confidence remained high throughout the process.",
            "Explanation": "The TUD method provides a more detailed view of the model's reasoning process and how its confidence evolves. It captures the high initial confidence in given information and slight decreases with each calculation step. This granular information about uncertainty dynamics is not available in the baseline method, which only provides a final confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TUD method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of the uncertainty dynamics, focusing on identifying patterns or trends that might provide insights into the model's reasoning process, even if they don't directly improve performance. This could involve clustering uncertainty trajectories to identify common patterns across different problem types. Second, we could investigate whether the explanations provided at each step, rather than the uncertainty estimates themselves, offer valuable insights into the model's reasoning. This might lead to a new method for improving model interpretability. Third, we could explore whether TUD is more effective for certain types of tasks or problem complexities, potentially leading to a hybrid approach that applies TUD selectively based on task characteristics. Finally, if the natural language uncertainty estimates prove challenging to quantify consistently, we could experiment with more structured prompts that elicit numerical uncertainty estimates while still capturing the temporal dynamics."
