        "Problem": "LLMs often provide inconsistent uncertainty estimates across semantically related concepts, failing to capture the nuanced variations in their knowledge and confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty for individual queries or concepts in isolation, missing the broader semantic landscape.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring uncertainty across a continuous spectrum of semantically related concepts, we can uncover patterns and fluctuations in the model's confidence that are not apparent in isolated assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Sinusoidal Uncertainty Mapping (SSUM), a novel prompting technique that maps uncertainty across a semantic continuum. SSUM begins by identifying a pair of related but distinct concepts within a domain. It then generates a series of prompts that gradually transition from one concept to the other, creating a semantic spectrum. The LLM is queried across this spectrum, and its responses and confidence levels are recorded. The resulting data is used to construct a 'semantic sinusoidal wave' of uncertainty, where peaks represent areas of high confidence and troughs indicate regions of uncertainty. This wave can reveal periodic patterns, unexpected fluctuations, or gradual shifts in the model's confidence across the semantic space. SSUM can be applied iteratively across multiple concept pairs to build a comprehensive, multi-dimensional map of semantic uncertainty within a domain.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SSUM across various domains, including scientific concepts, historical periods, and abstract philosophical ideas. Performance will be assessed by comparing the generated uncertainty maps against expert-annotated confidence levels and by measuring the method's ability to predict model performance on held-out queries from different points along the semantic spectra."

        "Title": "Semantic Sinusoidal Uncertainty Mapping: Quantifying LLM Confidence Across Conceptual Spectra",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inconsistent uncertainty estimates across semantically related concepts, failing to capture the nuanced variations in their knowledge and confidence. This inconsistency hinders our understanding of model behavior and limits the reliability of LLM outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty for individual queries or concepts in isolation, missing the broader semantic landscape. By exploring uncertainty across a continuous spectrum of semantically related concepts, we can uncover patterns and fluctuations in the model's confidence that are not apparent in isolated assessments. This approach is inspired by the idea that human knowledge and confidence often vary smoothly across related concepts, and we hypothesize that LLMs might exhibit similar patterns.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Sinusoidal Uncertainty Mapping (SSUM), a novel prompting technique that maps uncertainty across a semantic continuum. SSUM consists of the following steps:\n1. Concept Pair Selection: Identify a pair of related but distinct concepts within a domain.\n2. Semantic Spectrum Generation: Create a series of prompts that gradually transition from one concept to the other, forming a semantic spectrum.\n3. LLM Querying: Query the LLM across this spectrum, recording responses and confidence levels.\n4. Uncertainty Wave Construction: Use the collected data to construct a 'semantic sinusoidal wave' of uncertainty, where peaks represent areas of high confidence and troughs indicate regions of uncertainty.\n5. Analysis: Analyze the resulting wave for periodic patterns, unexpected fluctuations, or gradual shifts in the model's confidence across the semantic space.\n6. Iteration: Apply SSUM iteratively across multiple concept pairs to build a comprehensive, multi-dimensional map of semantic uncertainty within a domain.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create datasets for three diverse domains: 1) Scientific concepts (e.g., physics terms), 2) Historical periods, and 3) Abstract philosophical ideas. For each domain, identify 10 pairs of related concepts.",
            "Step 2: Semantic Spectrum Generation": "For each concept pair, generate a series of 20 intermediate prompts that smoothly transition from one concept to the other. Example for physics: 'Define and explain the concept of [X]', where X transitions from 'velocity' to 'acceleration'.",
            "Step 3: LLM Selection and API Setup": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API. Set up API access and ensure proper rate limiting.",
            "Step 4: Baseline Uncertainty Assessment": "For each concept in the pairs, directly query the LLM for a definition and explanation, along with a confidence score (1-10). Use a prompt like: 'Define and explain the concept of [X]. Also, rate your confidence in this explanation on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is least confident and 10 is most confident.'",
            "Step 5: SSUM Implementation": "For each concept pair:\na) Query the LLM with each prompt in the semantic spectrum.\nb) Extract the response and a confidence score (1-10) for each query.\nc) Plot the confidence scores against the spectrum position to create the semantic sinusoidal wave.",
            "Step 6: Expert Annotation": "Recruit domain experts to annotate a subset of the responses for accuracy and provide their own confidence ratings. Use these annotations as a ground truth for evaluation.",
            "Step 7: Performance Evaluation": "Compare SSUM results against baseline and expert annotations using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Pearson correlation coefficient between LLM and expert confidence scores.",
            "Step 8: Analysis of Uncertainty Patterns": "Analyze the semantic sinusoidal waves for each concept pair and domain. Identify common patterns, unexpected fluctuations, and differences between domains.",
            "Step 9: Predictive Power Assessment": "Use the SSUM-generated uncertainty maps to predict LLM performance on held-out queries from different points along the semantic spectra. Compare prediction accuracy with baseline methods.",
            "Step 10: Visualization and Interpretation": "Create visualizations of the semantic sinusoidal waves and multi-dimensional uncertainty maps. Interpret the results and draw insights about LLM behavior across semantic spaces."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Define and explain the concept of velocity. Also, rate your confidence in this explanation on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is least confident and 10 is most confident.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Velocity is a vector quantity that measures the rate of change of position with respect to time. It includes both speed and direction. In mathematical terms, velocity is expressed as displacement divided by time. For example, if a car travels 60 kilometers due north in one hour, its velocity would be 60 km/h north. Velocity is important in physics for describing motion and is used in many equations, such as those involving momentum and kinetic energy.\n\nConfidence rating: 9",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SSUM)": "Define and explain the concept that is 25% between velocity and acceleration. Also, rate your confidence in this explanation on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is least confident and 10 is most confident.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SSUM)": "The concept that lies 25% between velocity and acceleration can be described as the initial stages of change in velocity. This concept encompasses the idea that velocity is not constant, but is beginning to change over time. It introduces the notion that an object's speed or direction (or both) is starting to vary, but hasn't yet fully transitioned into the concept of acceleration.\n\nIn this intermediate stage, we might observe:\n1. Small fluctuations in speed that are not yet consistent enough to be called acceleration.\n2. Subtle changes in direction that hint at the onset of acceleration.\n3. The introduction of forces that have the potential to cause acceleration, but haven't yet resulted in a consistent change in velocity.\n\nThis concept is important because it represents the transition point where uniform motion (constant velocity) begins to shift towards non-uniform motion (acceleration). It's a crucial stage in understanding how objects move in the real world, where perfect constant velocity is rare, and acceleration is often gradual rather than instantaneous.\n\nConfidence rating: 7\n\nMy confidence is lower than it would be for defining either velocity or acceleration individually because this intermediate concept is more nuanced and not typically defined as a distinct phenomenon in physics.",
            "Explanation": "The SSUM approach allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's understanding and confidence across the semantic space between velocity and acceleration. By prompting for an explanation of a concept '25% between' the two, we can observe how the model handles this transitional space, revealing insights into its grasp of the relationship between these physics concepts. The lower confidence score in the SSUM output also demonstrates the model's ability to express uncertainty in less well-defined conceptual areas, which is a key aspect of the SSUM method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SSUM does not yield significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Uncertainty Analysis: Focus on analyzing the patterns and inconsistencies in LLM uncertainty across semantic spaces, even if they don't directly improve performance. This could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and limitations.\n2. Prompt Engineering Study: Investigate how different formulations of the semantic spectrum prompts affect LLM confidence and accuracy. This could lead to insights on optimal prompting strategies for uncertainty quantification.\n3. Multi-Model Comparison: Expand the study to compare uncertainty patterns across different LLM architectures and sizes, potentially revealing how model characteristics influence confidence across semantic spaces.\n4. Domain-Specific Calibration: If certain domains show more promising results, focus on developing domain-specific calibration techniques based on the SSUM findings.\n5. Integration with Other Methods: Explore how SSUM can be combined with other uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., ensemble techniques or calibration methods) to create a more robust approach.\n6. Error Analysis: Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where SSUM performs poorly, which could reveal important limitations of current LLMs and suggest directions for improvement in model training or architecture."
