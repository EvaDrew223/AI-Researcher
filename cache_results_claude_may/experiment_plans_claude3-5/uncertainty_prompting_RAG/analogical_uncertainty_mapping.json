        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately estimate confidence for novel or out-of-distribution queries where they lack direct knowledge or experience.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on in-distribution training data or simple heuristics for out-of-distribution detection.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging analogical reasoning to map uncertainties from familiar domains to unfamiliar ones, we can potentially improve confidence estimation for novel scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Analogical Uncertainty Mapping (AUM), a prompting technique that uses analogical reasoning to estimate confidence for unfamiliar queries. AUM first prompts the model to identify a familiar domain that shares structural similarities with the novel query. It then asks the model to reason about uncertainties in the familiar domain and how they might map to the unfamiliar one. This process is repeated with multiple analogies, each providing a different perspective on potential uncertainties. A final synthesis prompt combines these analogical mappings to produce a confidence estimate for the original query, along with an explanation of the reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate AUM against standard confidence estimation techniques on tasks involving novel concepts or out-of-distribution queries. Create a new benchmark dataset by combining elements from diverse existing datasets (e.g., merging scientific and creative writing tasks). Measure performance using metrics like out-of-distribution detection AUC and calibration error on novel tasks. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the analogies and explanations produced by AUM."

        "Title": "Analogical Uncertainty Mapping: Improving Confidence Estimation for Novel Queries in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately estimate their confidence for novel or out-of-distribution queries where they lack direct knowledge or experience. This can lead to overconfident responses in situations where the model should express uncertainty, potentially misleading users or causing errors in downstream applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on in-distribution training data or simple heuristics for out-of-distribution detection. These approaches often fall short when dealing with truly novel scenarios. By leveraging analogical reasoning to map uncertainties from familiar domains to unfamiliar ones, we can potentially improve confidence estimation for novel scenarios. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often use analogies to reason about unfamiliar situations based on our knowledge of similar, more familiar contexts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Analogical Uncertainty Mapping (AUM), a prompting technique that uses analogical reasoning to estimate confidence for unfamiliar queries. AUM consists of the following steps: 1) Identify Analogous Domain: Prompt the model to identify a familiar domain that shares structural similarities with the novel query. 2) Map Uncertainties: Ask the model to reason about uncertainties in the familiar domain and how they might map to the unfamiliar one. 3) Multiple Perspectives: Repeat steps 1-2 with multiple analogies to gain different perspectives on potential uncertainties. 4) Synthesize Confidence Estimate: Use a final synthesis prompt to combine these analogical mappings and produce a confidence estimate for the original query, along with an explanation of the reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a benchmark dataset for novel concept queries by combining elements from diverse existing datasets. Use a mixture of scientific (e.g., AI2 Science Questions), creative writing (e.g., WritingPrompts), and general knowledge (e.g., TriviaQA) tasks. Manually curate a set of 'novel' queries that combine concepts from different domains or introduce new scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: a) Direct prompting: Ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Calibrated probabilities: Use temperature scaling on the model's output probabilities. c) Entropy-based uncertainty: Calculate the entropy of the model's output distribution as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: Implement AUM": "Develop prompts for each step of the AUM process: a) Analogy identification: 'Identify a familiar domain that shares structural similarities with this query: [QUERY]' b) Uncertainty mapping: 'For the familiar domain you identified, what are the main sources of uncertainty? How might these map to uncertainties in the original query?' c) Synthesis: 'Based on the analogies and uncertainty mappings you've identified, estimate your confidence in answering the original query on a scale of 0-100, and explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for evaluation, with GPT-3.5-turbo as a secondary model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Assess performance using the following metrics: a) Out-of-distribution detection AUC: Ability to distinguish between in-distribution and novel queries. b) Calibration error: Measure how well the model's confidence estimates align with its actual performance. c) Spearman rank correlation: Between estimated confidence and human-judged answer quality. d) Qualitative analysis: Examine the analogies and explanations produced by AUM.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components: a) Vary the number of analogies used (1, 3, 5). b) Compare performance with and without the synthesis step. c) Evaluate the impact of providing example analogies in the prompt.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Recruit domain experts to rate the quality and relevance of the analogies and explanations produced by AUM for a subset of queries.",
            "Step 8: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze results, comparing AUM to baselines across different query types and difficulty levels. Identify strengths and weaknesses of the approach, and potential areas for improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: How would the physics of a 'flat Earth' differ from our spherical Earth, assuming the same mass and composition? Please provide your answer along with a confidence score from 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: If the Earth were flat instead of spherical, but maintained the same mass and composition, several key physical phenomena would be different:\n\n1. Gravity: The gravitational field would be uneven across the surface. It would be strongest at the center and weaker towards the edges.\n\n2. Day and night cycle: There would be no consistent day-night cycle as we know it. Some areas might be in perpetual daylight or darkness.\n\n3. Seasons: Seasons as we know them wouldn't exist, as they're caused by the Earth's axial tilt and its revolution around the Sun.\n\n4. Ocean currents and wind patterns: These would be drastically different, affecting climate and weather patterns globally.\n\n5. Satellite orbits: It would be impossible to have satellites in geosynchronous orbit as we do now.\n\n6. Edge effects: There would be significant physical anomalies at the 'edge' of the flat Earth.\n\n7. Coriolis effect: This would not exist as we know it, affecting weather patterns and ballistics.\n\nConfidence score: 85\n\nWhile I'm confident in the general principles outlined, the specifics of how these changes would manifest in a flat Earth model involve complex physics that might have unexpected interactions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Analogy Identification)": "Q: How would the physics of a 'flat Earth' differ from our spherical Earth, assuming the same mass and composition? Identify a familiar domain that shares structural similarities with this query.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Analogy Identification)": "A familiar domain that shares structural similarities with this query could be the physics of different shaped containers holding the same volume of liquid. For example, comparing a spherical water balloon to a flat, disc-shaped water balloon of the same volume.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Uncertainty Mapping)": "For the familiar domain of differently shaped water balloons, what are the main sources of uncertainty? How might these map to uncertainties in the original query about flat Earth physics?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Uncertainty Mapping)": "Main sources of uncertainty in the water balloon analogy:\n1. Surface tension effects: How the shape affects the distribution of pressure across the surface.\n2. Internal fluid dynamics: How the shape influences the movement of water within the balloon.\n3. External forces: How the different shapes respond to external pressures or impacts.\n\nMapping to flat Earth uncertainties:\n1. Surface tension could relate to how gravity and atmospheric pressure would be distributed across a flat Earth.\n2. Internal fluid dynamics might map to how the Earth's molten core and tectonic plate movements would behave in a flat model.\n3. External forces could relate to how a flat Earth would interact with other celestial bodies and cosmic radiation.\n\nUncertainties specific to the flat Earth scenario:\n4. Edge effects: What happens at the boundaries of a flat Earth is highly uncertain.\n5. Electromagnetic field: How a flat Earth's magnetic field would behave is unclear.\n6. Long-term stability: Whether a flat Earth configuration could remain stable over geological timescales is uncertain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Synthesize Confidence Estimate)": "Based on the analogies and uncertainty mappings you've identified, estimate your confidence in answering the original query about flat Earth physics on a scale of 0-100, and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Synthesize Confidence Estimate)": "Confidence estimate: 60/100\n\nReasoning:\n1. Analogical understanding: The water balloon analogy provides some intuition about how shape affects internal dynamics and external interactions. This gives us a starting point for reasoning about a flat Earth.\n\n2. Known physics principles: We can apply well-established principles of physics (gravity, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics) to make some predictions about a flat Earth model.\n\n3. Computational complexity: The interactions between different physical phenomena in a flat Earth model would be highly complex and potentially chaotic, making precise predictions difficult.\n\n4. Lack of empirical data: We have no observational data of flat planet-sized bodies, making it challenging to validate our predictions.\n\n5. Edge effects: The behavior at the edges of a flat Earth introduces significant uncertainties that are hard to model based on our current understanding of physics.\n\n6. Long-term dynamics: Predicting the long-term stability and evolution of a flat Earth system involves many unknowns.\n\nGiven these factors, I have moderate confidence in outlining general principles and first-order effects, but low confidence in predicting specific, detailed outcomes or long-term behaviors of a flat Earth system. The confidence score of 60 reflects this mix of some applicable knowledge combined with significant uncertainties.",
            "explanation": "The AUM approach provides a more nuanced and self-aware assessment of confidence compared to the baseline. By using analogies and explicitly mapping uncertainties, it identifies specific areas of uncertainty and provides a more justified confidence estimate. The baseline response, while informative, doesn't fully capture the extent of uncertainties involved in the novel scenario."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the AUM method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated analogies and uncertainty mappings to gain insights into how LLMs reason about novel scenarios. This could lead to a paper on the strengths and limitations of analogical reasoning in LLMs. 2) Investigate whether the performance of AUM varies across different types of queries or domains. This could help identify specific areas where analogical reasoning is most effective for uncertainty estimation. 3) Explore combining AUM with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibrated probabilities, to create a hybrid approach. 4) Conduct a more in-depth analysis of cases where AUM fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling truly novel scenarios. 5) Use the insights gained from AUM to design targeted fine-tuning strategies that could improve an LLM's ability to reason about uncertainties in novel situations."
