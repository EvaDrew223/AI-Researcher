    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately assess their uncertainty, particularly when dealing with complex or multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or ensemble methods, which can be computationally expensive or impractical for real-time applications.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often refine their confidence assessments through iterative thinking and self-questioning. Mimicking this process could lead to more accurate uncertainty quantification in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Iterative Uncertainty Refinement (IUR), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model through a series of self-reflective questions to progressively refine its uncertainty estimate. The process involves: 1) Initial answer and confidence estimation, 2) Prompt for potential sources of error or uncertainty, 3) Re-evaluation of confidence based on identified uncertainties, 4) Exploration of alternative perspectives or approaches, 5) Final synthesis of confidence estimate with justification. Each step uses carefully crafted prompts to encourage deep reflection on the model's knowledge limitations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare IUR with single-pass confidence estimation on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MMLU and BigBench, analyzing both the final confidence scores and the quality of the uncertainty justifications provided."

        "Title": "Iterative Uncertainty Refinement: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their uncertainty, particularly in complex or multi-step reasoning tasks. This leads to overconfident predictions on incorrect answers or underconfident predictions on correct answers, reducing the reliability and interpretability of these models in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or computationally expensive ensemble methods. These approaches fail to capture the nuanced process of human experts refining their confidence through iterative thinking and self-questioning. By mimicking this process, we aim to develop a more accurate and computationally efficient method for uncertainty quantification in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Iterative Uncertainty Refinement (IUR), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model through a series of self-reflective questions to progressively refine its uncertainty estimate. The process involves five key steps: 1) Initial answer and confidence estimation, 2) Prompt for potential sources of error or uncertainty, 3) Re-evaluation of confidence based on identified uncertainties, 4) Exploration of alternative perspectives or approaches, and 5) Final synthesis of confidence estimate with justification. Each step uses carefully crafted prompts to encourage deep reflection on the model's knowledge limitations and potential sources of error.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) and BIG-Bench datasets. Select a diverse subset of 1000 questions from each dataset, ensuring a mix of different difficulty levels and domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Single-pass confidence estimation: directly ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 2) Ensemble method: use 5 different prompts for each question and aggregate the results.",
            "Step 3: IUR Implementation": "Implement the Iterative Uncertainty Refinement method with the following steps for each question:\na) Initial answer and confidence: Prompt the model to provide an initial answer and confidence score.\nb) Error identification: Ask the model to list potential sources of error or uncertainty in its answer.\nc) Confidence re-evaluation: Based on the identified uncertainties, prompt the model to reassess its confidence.\nd) Alternative perspectives: Ask the model to consider alternative approaches or viewpoints.\ne) Final synthesis: Prompt the model to provide a final answer, confidence score, and justification based on the previous steps.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\na) Run the baseline methods on all questions.\nb) Run the IUR method on all questions.\nc) Record the final answers, confidence scores, and intermediate steps for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics:\na) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers.\nb) Calibration error: Measure the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy.\nc) Brier score: Assess the quality of probabilistic predictions.\nd) Confidence-accuracy correlation: Measure how well confidence scores correlate with correct answers.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses:\na) Compare the performance of IUR against baselines using the defined metrics.\nb) Analyze the progression of confidence scores through the IUR steps.\nc) Evaluate the quality and relevance of identified uncertainties and alternative perspectives.\nd) Assess the impact of domain and question difficulty on the effectiveness of IUR.\ne) Compare the performance across different models (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5 vs Claude if applicable)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your initial confidence level from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Error Identification)": "What are potential sources of error or uncertainty in your answer about the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Error Identification)": "Potential sources of uncertainty:\n1. Recent changes in government structure (although highly unlikely)\n2. Confusion with cultural or economic capitals\n3. Historical changes in capital cities\n4. Misunderstanding of the question (e.g., assuming it asks about a different country)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Confidence Re-evaluation)": "Based on these potential sources of uncertainty, re-evaluate your confidence in your answer about the capital of France. Provide a new confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Confidence Re-evaluation)": "After considering the potential sources of uncertainty, I would re-evaluate my confidence score to 98. The identified uncertainties are extremely unlikely to affect the answer, as Paris has been the stable capital of France for centuries and is widely recognized as such.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Alternative Perspectives)": "Consider any alternative perspectives or approaches to answering the question about the capital of France. Are there any other considerations that might affect the answer or your confidence?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Alternative Perspectives)": "Alternative perspectives to consider:\n1. Administrative vs. Cultural Capital: While Paris is undoubtedly the administrative capital, one could argue that other cities like Lyon or Marseille have significant cultural importance.\n2. Historical Perspective: Throughout history, other cities like Versailles have briefly served as the seat of government, although not officially as the capital.\n3. EU Context: In the context of the European Union, one might consider Brussels as a kind of 'capital' for France in terms of EU governance.\nHowever, these perspectives don't change the fact that Paris is the official and widely recognized capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Final Synthesis)": "Based on your initial answer, the identified uncertainties, your re-evaluated confidence, and the alternative perspectives considered, provide your final answer to the question 'What is the capital of France?' Include your final confidence score (0-100) and a justification for your answer and confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nFinal Confidence Score: 99\nJustification: Paris is the undisputed capital of France, both historically and in the present day. It serves as the administrative, political, and cultural center of the country. While we considered potential sources of uncertainty such as recent changes in government structure or historical shifts, these are extremely unlikely to affect the answer. Alternative perspectives, such as the importance of other French cities or the role of Brussels in EU governance, don't change Paris's status as the capital. The high confidence score (99) reflects the overwhelming evidence and global recognition of Paris as France's capital, with only a tiny margin left for any unforeseen circumstances.",
            "explanation": "The IUR method demonstrates a more thorough and reflective process compared to the baseline. It considers potential errors, re-evaluates confidence, and explores alternative perspectives before arriving at a final, well-justified answer and confidence score. This process allows for a more nuanced and potentially more accurate assessment of the model's true uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IUR method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the intermediate steps to understand where the method falls short. This could involve examining which types of questions or domains benefit most from IUR, and which don't, potentially revealing insights about the model's reasoning processes. Second, we could explore variations of the IUR method, such as changing the order of steps, adding or removing steps, or experimenting with different prompting strategies for each step. Third, we could investigate how the effectiveness of IUR varies with model size or architecture, which could provide valuable insights into the relationship between model capacity and uncertainty quantification. Finally, we could turn this into an analysis paper, focusing on how different prompting strategies affect LLMs' expressions of uncertainty, and what this reveals about their internal representations and decision-making processes."
