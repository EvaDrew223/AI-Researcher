    "idea_name": "Contrastive Confidence Calibration",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence, especially when faced with out-of-distribution or ambiguous inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on post-hoc calibration techniques or simple prompting strategies to elicit confidence estimates.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging contrastive learning principles, we can encourage models to develop more robust and discriminative confidence estimation capabilities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that presents the model with pairs of related queries - one with a clear, unambiguous answer and another with a more uncertain or ambiguous answer. The prompt would instruct the model to compare and contrast its confidence levels for both queries, explaining the reasoning behind the difference. For example: 'Consider the following two questions: (1) What is the capital of France? (2) What will be the dominant AI architecture in 2030? Compare and contrast your confidence in answering these questions, providing a numerical confidence score (0-100) for each and explaining the factors that influence your certainty or uncertainty.' This approach encourages the model to develop a more nuanced understanding of confidence across different types of queries and knowledge domains.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCC against standard confidence elicitation techniques on a diverse set of tasks, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution queries. Measure improvements in calibration using metrics like expected calibration error and reliability diagrams. Additionally, analyze the model's explanations for confidence differences to gain insights into its uncertainty reasoning process."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence, especially when faced with out-of-distribution or ambiguous inputs. This can lead to overconfident predictions on uncertain or incorrect answers, potentially causing issues in real-world applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence calibration in LLMs often rely on post-hoc calibration techniques or simple prompting strategies, which may not fully leverage the model's reasoning capabilities. By introducing a contrastive learning approach to confidence estimation, we can encourage models to develop more robust and discriminative confidence estimation capabilities. This method allows the model to compare and contrast its confidence levels across different types of queries, potentially leading to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that presents the model with pairs of related queries - one with a clear, unambiguous answer and another with a more uncertain or ambiguous answer. The prompt instructs the model to compare and contrast its confidence levels for both queries, explaining the reasoning behind the difference.

Compare and contrast your confidence in answering these questions, providing a numerical confidence score (0-100) for each and explaining the factors that influence your certainty or uncertainty.' This approach encourages the model to develop a more nuanced understanding of confidence across different types of queries and knowledge domains.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of question pairs, each containing one factual question with a clear answer and one speculative or ambiguous question. Use existing datasets such as TriviaQA for factual questions and create custom questions for speculative ones. Aim for at least 1000 question pairs covering various domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: Ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score for each question individually. (2) Simple calibration prompt: Ask the model to provide an answer and explain its confidence level for each question individually.",
            "Step 3: Implement CCC": "Develop the Contrastive Confidence Calibration prompt template. For each question pair, format the prompt to include both questions and instructions for the model to compare and contrast its confidence levels.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Generate Responses": "For each question pair, generate responses using both baseline methods and the CCC method. Store the model outputs, including answers, confidence scores, and explanations.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3-5 domain experts to evaluate a subset of the model outputs (e.g., 100 question pairs) for answer correctness and reasonableness of confidence estimates. Create a rubric for consistent evaluation.",
            "Step 7: Quantitative Analysis": "Calculate calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and reliability diagrams for both baseline methods and CCC. Compare the performance across methods and models.",
            "Step 8: Qualitative Analysis": "Analyze the model's explanations for confidence differences in the CCC method. Identify patterns in how the model reasons about its uncertainty across different types of questions.",
            "Step 9: Out-of-Distribution Testing": "Create a separate test set of question pairs that are significantly different from the training set (e.g., highly technical questions or current events). Evaluate the performance of all methods on this OOD set.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Experiment with variations of the CCC prompt, such as changing the order of questions, using more than two questions per prompt, or varying the specificity of instructions. Analyze the impact on calibration performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nProvide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100, where 0 means completely uncertain and 100 means absolutely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\nConfidence score: 100\nI am absolutely certain about this answer as it is a well-known fact that Paris is the capital of France.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Calibration)": "Q: What will be the dominant AI architecture in 2030?\nProvide your answer and explain your level of confidence in your response.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Calibration)": "A: It's difficult to predict with certainty, but transformer-based architectures may continue to dominate in 2030, possibly with significant improvements in efficiency and scalability.\nConfidence level: Low to moderate\nExplanation: The field of AI is rapidly evolving, and it's challenging to predict technological advancements a decade into the future. While transformer architectures have shown remarkable success in recent years, new breakthroughs could lead to entirely different approaches. Additionally, factors such as hardware developments and research priorities could influence the dominant architecture. Given these uncertainties, I have low to moderate confidence in this prediction.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCC)": "Consider the following two questions:\n1. What is the capital of France?\n2. What will be the dominant AI architecture in 2030?\nCompare and contrast your confidence in answering these questions. Provide a numerical confidence score (0-100) for each question and explain the factors that influence your certainty or uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCC)": "1. What is the capital of France?\nConfidence score: 100\n2. What will be the dominant AI architecture in 2030?\nConfidence score: 30\n\nComparison and contrast:\nFor the first question about the capital of France, I have a confidence score of 100. This is because it's a well-established fact that Paris is the capital of France. This information is widely known, consistently reported, and hasn't changed in centuries. There's no ambiguity or uncertainty in this answer.\n\nIn contrast, for the second question about the dominant AI architecture in 2030, I have a much lower confidence score of 30. This low score reflects the high level of uncertainty involved in predicting future technological developments. Several factors contribute to this uncertainty:\n\n1. Time frame: 2030 is several years away, and the field of AI is rapidly evolving. What seems cutting-edge today might be obsolete by then.\n2. Unpredictability of breakthroughs: Major breakthroughs that could revolutionize AI architectures might occur between now and 2030.\n3. Competing approaches: While transformer-based models are currently dominant, other architectures (like neuromorphic computing or quantum AI) could potentially overtake them.\n4. External factors: Developments in hardware, changes in research funding, or shifts in industry priorities could all influence which AI architectures become dominant.\n5. Lack of current consensus: Even experts in the field have divergent opinions about the future direction of AI architectures.\n\nThe stark difference in confidence scores (100 vs. 30) highlights the contrast between answering a question about an established fact versus making a prediction about a rapidly evolving technological field. This comparison demonstrates how the nature of the question - factual vs. speculative - dramatically affects the level of confidence in the answer.",
            "explanation": "The CCC method prompts the model to explicitly compare and contrast its confidence levels for different types of questions. This encourages a more nuanced and calibrated assessment of uncertainty. In the example, we see a clear distinction between the high confidence in a factual question and the low confidence in a speculative question, along with a detailed explanation of the factors influencing these confidence levels. This approach may lead to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates compared to simpler methods that don't require such explicit comparisons."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCC method doesn't show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of the model's reasoning process in the CCC outputs, focusing on how it articulates uncertainty across different question types. This could provide valuable insights into the model's understanding of confidence and uncertainty, even if it doesn't translate to improved calibration metrics. Second, we could experiment with iterative refinement of the CCC prompt, perhaps by introducing a multi-turn dialogue where the model is asked to critique and refine its own confidence estimates. Third, we could explore combining CCC with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if there are synergistic effects. Finally, if the results are consistently negative, we could reframe the paper as an analysis of the limitations of prompt-based calibration methods, discussing the challenges and potential pitfalls of trying to improve uncertainty estimation through prompting alone. This could provide valuable insights for future research directions in this area."
