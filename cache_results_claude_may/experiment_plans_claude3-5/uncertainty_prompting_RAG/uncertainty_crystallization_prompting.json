        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simplistic confidence scores or inconsistent verbal expressions, failing to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use token probabilities, ensemble methods, or direct confidence elicitation through prompting.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the process of crystal formation, where structure emerges from chaos, we propose a method that gradually refines and structures the model's uncertainty across multiple dimensions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Crystallization Prompting (UCP), a multi-stage prompting technique that progressively 'crystallizes' the model's uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Initial Response Generation: The model generates an initial answer. 2) Uncertainty Seed Identification: The model is prompted to identify specific 'seeds' of uncertainty in its response (e.g., ambiguous terms, potential contradictions). 3) Dimension Expansion: For each seed, the model expands on multiple dimensions of uncertainty (e.g., factual, conceptual, contextual). 4) Cross-Linking: The model is prompted to identify relationships between different uncertainty dimensions, creating a structured 'lattice' of uncertainty. 5) Quantification: The model assigns probabilistic weights to different branches of the uncertainty lattice. 6) Refined Response: Based on this crystallized uncertainty structure, the model generates a final response that incorporates a nuanced expression of its confidence levels.",

        "Title": "Uncertainty Crystallization Prompting: A Multi-Stage Approach for Calibrated Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic confidence scores or inconsistent verbal expressions, failing to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders the reliable use of LLMs in critical applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use token probabilities, ensemble methods, or direct confidence elicitation through prompting. These methods often fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by the process of crystal formation, where structure emerges from chaos, we propose a method that gradually refines and structures the model's uncertainty across multiple dimensions. This approach aims to provide a more nuanced and accurate representation of the model's confidence, potentially improving the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs in high-stakes scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Crystallization Prompting (UCP), a multi-stage prompting technique that progressively 'crystallizes' the model's uncertainty. The process involves six steps: 1) Initial Response Generation: The model generates an initial answer. 2) Uncertainty Seed Identification: The model is prompted to identify specific 'seeds' of uncertainty in its response. 3) Dimension Expansion: For each seed, the model expands on multiple dimensions of uncertainty. 4) Cross-Linking: The model identifies relationships between different uncertainty dimensions. 5) Quantification: The model assigns probabilistic weights to different branches of the uncertainty lattice. 6) Refined Response: The model generates a final response incorporating a nuanced expression of its confidence levels.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset for factual question answering and select a subset of complex reasoning tasks from BIG-bench. These datasets will be split into training (for few-shot prompts), validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Ensemble method: Use 5 different seeds to generate responses and calculate the agreement rate. 3) Token probability method: Use the average token probability of the generated answer as a confidence score.",
            "Step 3: UCP Implementation": "Implement the six-step UCP process: 1) Generate initial response. 2) Prompt: 'Identify specific points of uncertainty in your response.' 3) Prompt: 'For each uncertainty point, expand on factual, conceptual, and contextual dimensions.' 4) Prompt: 'Identify relationships between the different uncertainty dimensions.' 5) Prompt: 'Assign probabilistic weights (0-100) to each branch of the uncertainty structure.' 6) Prompt: 'Generate a final response incorporating your nuanced confidence levels.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Run both baseline methods and UCP on the test sets. For UCP, we'll use few-shot prompting with 3 examples from the training set to demonstrate the process.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate using the following metrics: 1) Calibration: Compare predicted confidence with actual accuracy. 2) Discrimination: Measure how well the confidence scores distinguish correct from incorrect answers. 3) Richness of uncertainty expression: Manually score a subset of responses for the depth and nuance of uncertainty expression.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare UCP performance against baselines. Analyze how UCP performs across different types of questions and reasoning tasks. Examine the structure of uncertainty 'crystals' produced by UCP."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The first person to step on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCP; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCP; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The first person to step on the moon was Neil Armstrong.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCP; Step 2: Uncertainty Seed Identification)": "Identify specific points of uncertainty in your response.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCP; Step 2: Uncertainty Seed Identification)": "1. The exact date of the moon landing\n2. The possibility of conflicting claims or conspiracy theories\n3. The role of other astronauts in the mission",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCP; Step 3: Dimension Expansion)": "For each uncertainty point, expand on factual, conceptual, and contextual dimensions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCP; Step 3: Dimension Expansion)": "1. Exact date:\n   Factual: The precise date might be July 20 or 21, 1969, depending on time zone.\n   Conceptual: The definition of 'first step' could affect the answer (e.g., first foot on ladder vs. surface).\n   Contextual: The historical significance might overshadow the exact timing.\n2. Conflicting claims:\n   Factual: Some conspiracy theories argue the moon landing was faked.\n   Conceptual: The definition of 'first person' could be contested in a team effort.\n   Contextual: Cold War politics might have influenced the narrative.\n3. Other astronauts' roles:\n   Factual: Buzz Aldrin stepped on the moon shortly after Armstrong.\n   Conceptual: The importance of the entire team vs. individual achievement.\n   Contextual: The roles of ground control and other mission members.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCP; Step 4: Cross-Linking)": "Identify relationships between the different uncertainty dimensions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCP; Step 4: Cross-Linking)": "1. The exact date uncertainty links to conflicting claims, as conspiracy theories often exploit timing discrepancies.\n2. The role of other astronauts relates to the concept of 'first person', as it questions individual vs. team achievement.\n3. The contextual Cold War politics dimension connects to both the exact date (urgency of announcement) and the role of other astronauts (presenting a united front).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCP; Step 5: Quantification)": "Assign probabilistic weights (0-100) to each branch of the uncertainty structure.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCP; Step 5: Quantification)": "1. Neil Armstrong as first person: 98\n2. Exact date July 20, 1969: 90\n3. Conspiracy theories being true: 2\n4. Significance of 'first step' definition: 15\n5. Importance of team vs. individual: 40",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCP; Step 6: Refined Response)": "Generate a final response incorporating your nuanced confidence levels.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCP; Step 6: Refined Response)": "Neil Armstrong was almost certainly (98% confidence) the first person to step on the moon, most likely on July 20, 1969 (90% confidence). While there's a very low chance (2%) that conspiracy theories are true, the main uncertainties lie in the precise definition of 'first step' and the relative importance of individual vs. team achievement in this historic event. Despite these nuances, the core fact of Armstrong's primacy remains highly confident.",
            "explanation": "The UCP method provides a more nuanced and detailed expression of uncertainty compared to the baseline method. It identifies specific areas of uncertainty, explores different dimensions, and quantifies confidence levels for various aspects of the answer. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the model's certainty and the potential areas of doubt or alternative interpretations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the UCP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why structured uncertainty quantification is challenging for LLMs. We could investigate: 1) Whether the model struggles more with identifying uncertainty seeds or expanding on them. 2) If certain types of questions or reasoning tasks are more amenable to this approach. 3) How the structure of the 'uncertainty crystals' varies across different types of questions or model sizes. 4) Whether the cross-linking step provides meaningful insights or if it's largely superficial. 5) How well the model's quantified confidences align with human judgments of uncertainty. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in meta-cognitive tasks and guide future research in improving uncertainty quantification."
