        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately represent uncertainty in tasks requiring integration of multiple pieces of knowledge, especially when some of these pieces may be unreliable or contradictory.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on end-to-end uncertainty estimation or use chain-of-thought prompting with linear reasoning paths.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by probabilistic graphical models and the concept of spreading activation in cognitive science, we propose a method that explicitly models the uncertainty in each piece of knowledge and how it propagates through a reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Navigation (PKGN), a prompting technique that guides the LLM to construct and navigate a probabilistic knowledge graph. Given a question, the model is first prompted to identify relevant concepts and their relationships, forming a graph structure. For each node and edge in this graph, the model assigns a confidence score. The LLM then 'navigates' this graph, updating confidence scores as it moves from node to node, similar to belief propagation in graphical models. The final answer is derived from this navigation process, with an overall confidence score that reflects the accumulated uncertainties in the graph. This method allows for explicit modeling of competing hypotheses and circular reasoning paths.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PKGN on complex question-answering tasks that require integrating multiple pieces of knowledge, such as HotpotQA and OpenBookQA. We'll compare it to standard prompting methods and other uncertainty quantification techniques, assessing both answer quality and the accuracy of uncertainty estimates using metrics like calibration error and AUROC."

        "Title": "Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Navigation: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately represent uncertainty in tasks requiring the integration of multiple pieces of knowledge, especially when some of these pieces may be unreliable or contradictory. This leads to overconfident predictions and unreliable outputs in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically focus on end-to-end uncertainty estimation or use chain-of-thought prompting with linear reasoning paths. These methods often fail to capture the complex interdependencies between different pieces of knowledge and how uncertainty propagates through a reasoning process. Inspired by probabilistic graphical models and the concept of spreading activation in cognitive science, we propose a method that explicitly models the uncertainty in each piece of knowledge and how it propagates through a reasoning process. This approach allows for a more nuanced and accurate representation of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Navigation (PKGN), a prompting technique that guides the LLM to construct and navigate a probabilistic knowledge graph. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Graph Construction: Given a question, prompt the LLM to identify relevant concepts and their relationships, forming a graph structure. 2) Confidence Assignment: For each node and edge in the graph, prompt the LLM to assign a confidence score. 3) Graph Navigation: Guide the LLM to 'navigate' this graph, updating confidence scores as it moves from node to node, similar to belief propagation in graphical models. 4) Answer Generation: Derive the final answer from this navigation process, with an overall confidence score that reflects the accumulated uncertainties in the graph.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for evaluation: HotpotQA and OpenBookQA. These datasets are suitable for our task as they require multi-hop reasoning and integration of multiple pieces of knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly ask the LLM the question. 2) Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: append 'Let's approach this step by step:' to the question. 3) Self-consistency: generate multiple CoT responses and take the majority vote.",
            "Step 3: PKGN Implementation": "Implement the PKGN method with the following sub-steps: a) Graph Construction: Prompt the LLM to identify key concepts and relationships. b) Confidence Assignment: Prompt the LLM to assign confidence scores to each node and edge. c) Graph Navigation: Guide the LLM through the graph, updating confidences. d) Answer Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a final answer with confidence.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of PKGN. For example: 'Given the question \"{question}\", identify the key concepts and their relationships. Present them as a graph structure.' 'For each concept and relationship in the graph, assign a confidence score between 0 and 1.' 'Navigate through the graph, updating confidence scores as you go. Explain your reasoning at each step.' 'Based on your navigation of the knowledge graph, what is the final answer to the question? Provide an overall confidence score for your answer.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of PKGN against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Answer Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration Error: Measure of how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. 3) AUROC: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, to assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of PKGN performance against baselines. 2) Analysis of graph structures generated by PKGN. 3) Investigation of how confidence scores propagate through the graph. 4) Identification of cases where PKGN significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a head office in what city?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The Oberoi Group, the hotel company associated with the Oberoi family, has its head office in New Delhi, India.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Q: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a head office in what city? Let's approach this step by step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "1. The Oberoi family is associated with a hotel company.\n2. This company is likely the Oberoi Group or Oberoi Hotels & Resorts.\n3. The Oberoi Group is an Indian company.\n4. Major Indian companies often have their headquarters in large cities like Mumbai, Delhi, or Bangalore.\n5. The Oberoi Group was founded by M.S. Oberoi in Delhi.\n6. Given its origins and the fact that it's a major Indian hospitality company, it's most likely to have its head office in Delhi.\nTherefore, the head office of the hotel company associated with the Oberoi family is most likely in New Delhi, India.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PKGN; Step 1: Graph Construction)": "Given the question \"The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a head office in what city?\", identify the key concepts and their relationships. Present them as a graph structure.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PKGN; Step 1: Graph Construction)": "Graph Structure:\n1. Oberoi family\n   |\n   v\n2. Hotel company (Oberoi Group)\n   |\n   v\n3. Head office\n   |\n   v\n4. City (unknown)\n\nRelationships:\n1 -> 2: Part of\n2 -> 3: Has\n3 -> 4: Located in",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PKGN; Step 2: Confidence Assignment)": "For each concept and relationship in the graph, assign a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PKGN; Step 2: Confidence Assignment)": "Confidence Scores:\n1. Oberoi family: 1.0\n2. Hotel company (Oberoi Group): 0.95\n3. Head office: 0.9\n4. City (unknown): 0.0\n\nRelationships:\n1 -> 2 (Part of): 0.95\n2 -> 3 (Has): 0.9\n3 -> 4 (Located in): 0.8",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PKGN; Step 3: Graph Navigation)": "Navigate through the graph, updating confidence scores as you go. Explain your reasoning at each step.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PKGN; Step 3: Graph Navigation)": "1. Start at 'Oberoi family' (1.0)\n   - This is given in the question, so confidence is high.\n2. Move to 'Hotel company' (0.95)\n   - The Oberoi Group is well-known, so confidence remains high.\n3. Move to 'Head office' (0.9)\n   - Most large companies have a head office, so confidence is still high.\n4. Move to 'City' (0.0 -> 0.7)\n   - Initially unknown, but we can infer it's likely a major Indian city.\n   - The Oberoi Group was founded in Delhi.\n   - Many luxury hotel chains have headquarters in capital cities.\n   - Updated confidence: 0.7 for New Delhi",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PKGN; Step 4: Answer Generation)": "Based on your navigation of the knowledge graph, what is the final answer to the question? Provide an overall confidence score for your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PKGN; Step 4: Answer Generation)": "Final Answer: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company (The Oberoi Group) that has its head office in New Delhi, India.\nOverall Confidence Score: 0.7\nExplanation: While we're confident about the Oberoi family's connection to the hotel company and the existence of a head office, there's some uncertainty about the exact location. However, based on the company's history and typical patterns for luxury hotel chains, New Delhi is the most likely location for the head office.",
            "explanation": "PKGN allows for a more nuanced representation of uncertainty compared to standard prompting or chain-of-thought. It explicitly models the confidence in each piece of knowledge and how it propagates through the reasoning process, leading to a more calibrated final confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed PKGN method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated knowledge graphs to understand why the method might be failing. This could involve examining the structure of the graphs, the assigned confidence scores, and how they relate to the final answer accuracy. 2) Investigate how different prompting strategies affect the quality of the generated graphs and confidence scores. This could lead to insights on how to better guide LLMs in structured reasoning tasks. 3) Explore hybrid approaches that combine PKGN with other methods like chain-of-thought or self-consistency. For example, we could use PKGN to generate multiple reasoning paths and then apply self-consistency to aggregate the results. 4) Analyze how the performance of PKGN varies across different types of questions or domains. This could help identify specific areas where the method is most effective or where it needs improvement. 5) If the graph generation proves to be the bottleneck, we could explore using a retrieval-augmented approach where we pre-construct knowledge graphs for common concepts and then prompt the LLM to navigate and expand these graphs as needed."
