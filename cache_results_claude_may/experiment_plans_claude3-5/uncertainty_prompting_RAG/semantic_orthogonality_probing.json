        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to capture the full spectrum of potential interpretations or semantic nuances in complex queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on token-level probabilities or simple ensemble techniques to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "In many cases, uncertainty arises not from a lack of knowledge, but from the existence of multiple valid interpretations or semantic dimensions that are orthogonal to each other.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Orthogonality Probing (SOP), a prompting technique that systematically explores orthogonal semantic dimensions of a query to build a comprehensive uncertainty profile. Given an input query, SOP first prompts the model to identify multiple semantic dimensions relevant to the query (e.g., temporal, spatial, causal, ethical). For each dimension, the model is then instructed to generate 'orthogonal' interpretations or perspectives that are maximally different from each other within that dimension. The model is prompted to assign confidence scores to each interpretation and explain potential interactions between dimensions. Finally, SOP aggregates these multi-dimensional insights into a structured uncertainty representation, capturing both the overall confidence and the specific areas of semantic ambiguity.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SOP on tasks that inherently involve multiple semantic dimensions, such as complex story understanding (e.g., ProtoQA dataset), multi-faceted ethical reasoning (e.g., Dilemmas dataset), and interdisciplinary scientific questions (e.g., AI2 Science Questions dataset). We will compare SOP against standard uncertainty estimation techniques, measuring both the quality of uncertainty estimates and the richness of the semantic insights provided."

        "Title": "Semantic Orthogonality Probing: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the full spectrum of potential interpretations or semantic nuances in complex queries. This limitation leads to incomplete or misleading uncertainty estimates, particularly in scenarios where multiple valid interpretations exist or where semantic dimensions are orthogonal to each other.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on token-level probabilities or simple ensemble techniques to estimate uncertainty. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the multifaceted nature of semantic uncertainty. In many cases, uncertainty arises not from a lack of knowledge, but from the existence of multiple valid interpretations or semantic dimensions that are orthogonal to each other. By systematically exploring these orthogonal semantic dimensions, we can build a more comprehensive and nuanced uncertainty profile, leading to more reliable and interpretable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Orthogonality Probing (SOP), a prompting technique that systematically explores orthogonal semantic dimensions of a query to build a comprehensive uncertainty profile. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Given an input query, prompt the model to identify multiple semantic dimensions relevant to the query (e.g., temporal, spatial, causal, ethical). 2) For each identified dimension, instruct the model to generate 'orthogonal' interpretations or perspectives that are maximally different from each other within that dimension. 3) Prompt the model to assign confidence scores to each interpretation and explain potential interactions between dimensions. 4) Aggregate these multi-dimensional insights into a structured uncertainty representation, capturing both the overall confidence and the specific areas of semantic ambiguity.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that inherently involve multiple semantic dimensions: 1) ProtoQA for complex story understanding, 2) Dilemmas dataset for multi-faceted ethical reasoning, and 3) AI2 Science Questions dataset for interdisciplinary scientific questions. Preprocess these datasets to ensure uniformity in input format.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation techniques: 1) Token-level probability method: Use the model's output probabilities for each token to estimate uncertainty. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple forward passes with different random seeds to generate an ensemble of outputs and calculate variance.",
            "Step 3: SOP Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Orthogonality Probing method with the following sub-steps: a) Dimension Identification: Prompt the model to list relevant semantic dimensions for each query. b) Orthogonal Interpretation Generation: For each dimension, prompt the model to generate maximally different interpretations. c) Confidence Scoring: Prompt the model to assign confidence scores to each interpretation. d) Interaction Analysis: Prompt the model to explain potential interactions between dimensions. e) Uncertainty Aggregation: Develop a method to aggregate the multi-dimensional insights into a structured uncertainty representation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for both baselines and SOP. Additionally, we'll use GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of SOP against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Quality of uncertainty estimates: Measure calibration using Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score. 2) Richness of semantic insights: Develop a rubric to assess the diversity and relevance of identified dimensions and interpretations. 3) Human evaluation: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the uncertainty representations.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of SOP performance across different types of queries and datasets. 2) Analysis of the most common and impactful semantic dimensions identified by SOP. 3) Investigation of cases where SOP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Token-level Probability)": "Rising sea levels due to climate change can lead to coastal flooding, erosion of shorelines, and displacement of coastal communities. It may also result in saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers, affecting agriculture and drinking water supplies.

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SOP; Step 2: Orthogonal Interpretation Generation)": "Temporal dimension interpretations:\n1. Short-term (1-5 years): Increased frequency of coastal flooding during storms and high tides.\n2. Medium-term (5-20 years): Gradual erosion of shorelines and initial displacement of some coastal communities.\n3. Long-term (20-100 years): Permanent inundation of low-lying islands and coastal areas, massive population displacement, and significant changes to global coastlines.\n4. Very long-term (100+ years): Potential stabilization of sea levels due to technological interventions or natural feedback mechanisms.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SOP; Step 3: Confidence Scoring)": "Assign confidence scores (0-100) to each interpretation in the temporal dimension and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SOP; Step 3: Confidence Scoring)": "Confidence scores for temporal dimension interpretations:\n1. Short-term: 90 - High confidence due to already observed increases in coastal flooding frequency.\n2. Medium-term: 80 - Strong scientific consensus, but some uncertainty in the rate of change.\n3. Long-term: 70 - Based on current projections, but higher uncertainty due to potential mitigation efforts and feedback loops.\n4. Very long-term: 40 - High uncertainty due to unpredictable technological advancements and long-term climate dynamics.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SOP; Step 4: Final Uncertainty Representation)": "Based on the analysis of multiple semantic dimensions, provide a structured uncertainty representation for the consequences of rising sea levels due to climate change.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SOP; Step 4: Final Uncertainty Representation)": "Structured Uncertainty Representation:\n\n1. Overall confidence: 75/100\n\n2. Dimension-specific uncertainties:\n   a. Temporal: 70/100 (higher certainty in short-term, decreasing for longer timescales)\n   b. Spatial: 80/100 (high certainty for coastal impacts, less for inland effects)\n   c. Environmental: 85/100 (strong scientific consensus on ecosystem impacts)\n   d. Socioeconomic: 65/100 (complex interactions increase uncertainty)\n   e. Severity: 60/100 (wide range of possible outcomes depending on mitigation efforts)\n\n3. Key areas of ambiguity:\n   - Long-term effectiveness of adaptation strategies\n   - Precise timing and magnitude of major tipping points\n   - Interactions between sea level rise and other climate change effects\n\n4. Confidence distribution:\n   - High confidence (>80%): Increased coastal flooding, shoreline erosion\n   - Medium confidence (60-80%): Saltwater intrusion, ecosystem disruption\n   - Low confidence (<60%): Exact extent of population displacement, economic costs\n\nThis structured representation captures both the overall uncertainty and specific areas of semantic ambiguity, providing a more comprehensive uncertainty profile than simple scalar estimates.",
            "explanation": "The SOP method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive uncertainty representation compared to the baseline. It captures multiple semantic dimensions, explores orthogonal interpretations within each dimension, and provides a structured uncertainty profile that includes dimension-specific uncertainties and key areas of ambiguity. This approach allows for a more detailed understanding of the uncertainties associated with the complex issue of sea level rise due to climate change."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SOP method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the semantic dimensions and interpretations generated by SOP to gain insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases. This could lead to a paper on the semantic structure of uncertainty in LLMs. 2) Investigate whether certain types of queries or domains benefit more from SOP than others, potentially leading to a targeted application of the method. 3) Explore how the SOP method could be used to improve other aspects of LLM performance, such as generating more diverse and creative responses or enhancing the model's ability to consider multiple perspectives. 4) Develop a hybrid approach that combines SOP with other uncertainty quantification methods, potentially leveraging the strengths of each approach."
