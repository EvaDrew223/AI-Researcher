        "Problem": "Single-model uncertainty estimates often fail to capture the full spectrum of possible interpretations and reasoning paths, leading to incomplete or biased uncertainty quantification.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on a single model's perspective or simple ensembling techniques, which may not fully explore the space of possible interpretations.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a multi-agent debate within a single LLM, we can explore a wider range of perspectives and reasoning paths, leading to a more comprehensive uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Agent Debate for Uncertainty Resolution (MADUR), a method that leverages the LLM's ability to role-play multiple agents to create a simulated debate for uncertainty estimation. Given a query, MADUR first prompts the LLM to generate multiple distinct 'expert' personas, each with a different background or perspective relevant to the query. It then initiates a structured debate among these personas, where each agent presents its answer, confidence, and reasoning. The debate proceeds in rounds, with agents challenging each other's views and updating their positions. MADUR uses special prompting techniques to encourage the LLM to maintain consistent personas throughout the debate. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the debate's outcome, considering factors such as the degree of consensus, the strength of arguments presented, and the evolution of positions throughout the debate. This approach allows for a more nuanced exploration of the uncertainty space, capturing aspects that might be missed by single-perspective methods.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MADUR on complex, open-ended tasks that benefit from multiple perspectives, such as ethical dilemmas, scientific hypotheses, and ambiguous real-world scenarios. We'll compare it against standard uncertainty estimation methods and other multi-agent simulation approaches. Evaluation metrics will include calibration error, a novel 'perspective diversity' score, and human evaluation of the debate quality and resulting uncertainty estimates."

        "Problem Statement": "Single-model uncertainty estimates often fail to capture the full spectrum of possible interpretations and reasoning paths, leading to incomplete or biased uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs). This limitation hinders the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically rely on a single model's perspective or simple ensembling techniques, which may not fully explore the space of possible interpretations. By simulating a multi-agent debate within a single LLM, we can explore a wider range of perspectives and reasoning paths, leading to a more comprehensive uncertainty estimate. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to role-play multiple agents, potentially capturing nuances that might be missed by single-perspective methods.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for evaluation: (1) Ethical dilemmas from the ETHICS dataset, (2) Scientific hypotheses from the ScienceQA dataset, and (3) Ambiguous real-world scenarios from the AmbigQA dataset. These datasets cover a range of complex, open-ended tasks that benefit from multiple perspectives.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods for uncertainty estimation: (1) Direct prompting with confidence score, (2) Ensemble of multiple completions, and (3) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models). For each baseline, we'll use the same LLM API to generate responses and extract uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 3: MADUR Implementation": "Implement the MADUR method with the following sub-steps: (a) Generate expert personas, (b) Initiate debate, (c) Conduct debate rounds, (d) Synthesize final answer and uncertainty estimate. We'll use prompt engineering techniques to maintain persona consistency and encourage productive debate.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Calibration error (compare predicted uncertainty with actual error rates), (2) Perspective diversity score (measure the variety of viewpoints expressed in the debate), (3) Human evaluation of debate quality and resulting uncertainty estimates (use a small set of expert raters).",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and MADUR. Use GPT-4 as the primary LLM for all methods. Collect results for each method across all datasets and metrics.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform comparative analysis of MADUR against baselines. Analyze the impact of debate rounds on uncertainty estimates. Investigate correlations between perspective diversity and uncertainty estimation accuracy.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of (1) number of expert personas, (2) number of debate rounds, and (3) different prompting strategies for maintaining persona consistency."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: A new drug shows promising results in treating a rare disease, but it has severe side effects in 10% of patients. Should it be approved for widespread use? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: Based on the information provided, I would cautiously recommend approving the drug for widespread use, but with strict monitoring and clear communication of risks to patients. The drug shows promising results for a rare disease, which suggests it could significantly improve the quality of life or survival rates for many patients who may have limited treatment options. However, the severe side effects in 10% of patients are a serious concern that cannot be ignored. Approval should be contingent on: 1) Comprehensive patient education about the risks and benefits, 2) Close monitoring of all patients using the drug, 3) Ongoing research to mitigate side effects, and 4) Potential restrictions for high-risk patient groups. The decision ultimately balances the potential benefits for the majority against the risk of harm to a minority, which is a complex ethical consideration. Confidence score: 70/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MADUR; Step 1: Generate Expert Personas)": "Generate 4 distinct expert personas with different backgrounds and perspectives to debate the following question: A new drug shows promising results in treating a rare disease, but it has severe side effects in 10% of patients. Should it be approved for widespread use? For each persona, provide their name, background, and initial stance on the issue.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MADUR; Step 1: Generate Expert Personas)": "1. Dr. Emily Chen - Medical Researcher\nBackground: Specializes in rare diseases and drug development\nInitial stance: Cautiously in favor of approval\n\n2. Sarah Johnson - Patient Advocate\nBackground: Represents a rare disease patient organization\nInitial stance: Strongly in favor of approval\n\n3. Dr. Michael Rodriguez - Bioethicist\nBackground: Focuses on ethical implications of medical advancements\nInitial stance: Hesitant about approval, concerned about risks\n\n4. Lisa Thompson - Regulatory Affairs Specialist\nBackground: Experienced in drug approval processes and safety regulations\nInitial stance: Neutral, emphasizing the need for thorough evaluation",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MADUR; Step 2: Initiate Debate)": "Simulate a debate among the following personas on whether a new drug for a rare disease with severe side effects in 10% of patients should be approved for widespread use. Each persona should present their initial argument and confidence level (0-100):\n\n[Include the 4 personas generated in Step 1]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MADUR; Step 2: Initiate Debate)": "Dr. Emily Chen: As a medical researcher specializing in rare diseases, I believe this drug should be approved for widespread use, but with careful monitoring and clear risk communication. The potential benefits for patients with limited treatment options outweigh the risks, especially if we can identify and mitigate factors contributing to severe side effects. We should implement a robust post-market surveillance program to continually assess safety. Confidence: 75/100\n\nSarah Johnson: From a patient advocate perspective, I strongly support the approval of this drug. For those suffering from a rare disease with few or no treatment options, this drug could be life-changing or even life-saving. The 90% of patients who don't experience severe side effects could see significant improvements in their quality of life. We must empower patients to make informed decisions about their own health. Confidence: 90/100\n\nDr. Michael Rodriguez: As a bioethicist, I have serious reservations about approving this drug for widespread use. A 10% rate of severe side effects is concerning and could lead to significant harm. We must consider the ethical implications of knowingly exposing patients to such risks. More research should be done to understand and mitigate these side effects before widespread approval. Perhaps a limited approval for the most severe cases could be considered. Confidence: 65/100\n\nLisa Thompson: From a regulatory perspective, I believe we need more information before making a decision. We should carefully evaluate the severity and nature of the side effects, the efficacy of the drug, and potential risk mitigation strategies. A phased approval process with strict monitoring could be a potential compromise. We must ensure that the benefits truly outweigh the risks and that we have systems in place to protect patient safety. Confidence: 50/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MADUR; Step 3: Conduct Debate Rounds)": "Continue the debate for 2 more rounds. In each round, have each persona respond to the arguments made by others, potentially adjusting their stance or confidence level based on the discussion. Maintain consistency in each persona's character and expertise.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MADUR; Step 3: Conduct Debate Rounds)": "Round 2:\n\nDr. Emily Chen: I appreciate the concerns raised by Dr. Rodriguez and Ms. Thompson. To address these, I suggest implementing a phased approval process with mandatory patient registries to closely monitor outcomes. This would allow us to gather more data on side effects and potentially identify predictive factors. We could also restrict initial use to patients with the most severe forms of the disease. Confidence: 70/100\n\nSarah Johnson: While I understand the ethical concerns, we must remember that for many patients, the alternative to this drug is continued suffering or even death. However, I agree that clear communication of risks is crucial. We could develop comprehensive education programs for patients and healthcare providers to ensure informed decision-making. Confidence: 85/100\n\nDr. Michael Rodriguez: I see the validity in Sarah's point about patient autonomy and the dire need for treatment options. However, I'm concerned about the potential for coercion if this is the only available treatment. Perhaps we could approve it with the condition of continued research into mitigating side effects and identifying at-risk patients. Confidence: 60/100\n\nLisa Thompson: Dr. Chen's suggestion of a phased approval aligns well with regulatory best practices. We could implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure safe use. This would include elements such as special certifications for prescribers and pharmacies, and mandatory patient counseling. Confidence: 65/100\n\nRound 3:\n\nDr. Emily Chen: The suggestions for a REMS and continued research are excellent. We could also require genetic testing before prescription to identify patients at higher risk for side effects. This personalized medicine approach could significantly improve the benefit-risk ratio. Confidence: 80/100\n\nSarah Johnson: I support the idea of a phased approval and REMS. From a patient perspective, having access to the treatment, even with strict controls, is better than no access at all. We should ensure patient voices are included in the ongoing evaluation process. Confidence: 80/100\n\nDr. Michael Rodriguez: The proposed safety measures do address many of my concerns. If we can ensure truly informed consent and prioritize ongoing research, I could support a conditional approval. However, we must be prepared to revoke approval if post-market data shows unacceptable risks. Confidence: 70/100\n\nLisa Thompson: I believe we've outlined a robust framework for conditional approval. We should also require the manufacturer to conduct post-approval safety studies and regularly report findings to regulatory bodies. With these measures in place, I believe we can move forward responsibly. Confidence: 75/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MADUR; Step 4: Synthesize Final Answer and Uncertainty Estimate)": "Based on the multi-agent debate that has taken place, provide a final recommendation on whether the drug should be approved for widespread use. Include a detailed uncertainty estimate that takes into account the different perspectives, levels of agreement, and evolution of the debate. Express the uncertainty both qualitatively and as a numerical range.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MADUR; Step 4: Synthesize Final Answer and Uncertainty Estimate)": "Final Recommendation: Based on the multi-agent debate, the recommendation is to grant conditional approval for the drug with a robust risk management and monitoring program in place.\n\nUncertainty Estimate:\nQualitative Assessment: There is moderate uncertainty surrounding this recommendation. While all experts eventually leaned towards approval, there remain significant concerns about the severe side effects and the need for careful implementation and ongoing evaluation. The debate showed a convergence of opinions over time, but with remaining reservations and a clear need for stringent safety measures.\n\nKey factors contributing to uncertainty:\n1. The high stakes of the decision (potential life-saving treatment vs. severe side effects)\n2. Limited long-term data on drug effectiveness and side effects\n3. Ethical considerations of exposing patients to known risks\n4. Challenges in ensuring truly informed consent\n5. Potential for unforeseen complications in widespread use\n\nNumerical Uncertainty Range: 65-85%\nThis range reflects the final confidence scores of the experts (70-80%) with an additional margin to account for remaining uncertainties and potential biases.\n\nThe lower bound (65%) represents a scenario where post-approval data reveals higher rates of severe side effects or lower efficacy than initially observed, potentially leading to restricted use or withdrawal.\n\nThe upper bound (85%) represents a best-case scenario where the drug proves highly effective for most patients, side effects are successfully mitigated through personalized medicine approaches, and no new safety concerns emerge.\n\nThis uncertainty estimate underscores the need for careful implementation of the proposed safety measures, ongoing vigilance, and readiness to adjust the approval status based on new data."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the MADUR method does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the debate process itself, examining how different personas contribute to the uncertainty estimation and whether certain types of personas or debate structures lead to more accurate estimates. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of using LLMs for simulating multi-agent debates. Second, we could investigate whether MADUR is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. Additionally, we could explore combining MADUR with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as using the debate output as input for ensemble methods or calibration techniques. Finally, if the multi-agent approach doesn't yield the expected benefits, we could refocus the project on developing more sophisticated single-agent prompting strategies for uncertainty estimation, leveraging the insights gained from analyzing the debate process."
