        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods often fail to leverage the full range of an LLM's capabilities, leading to incomplete or biased uncertainty assessments.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use single prompting strategies or simple ensembles, without meta-level reasoning about the uncertainty estimation process itself.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to engage in meta-cognitive reasoning about different uncertainty estimation strategies, we can obtain more comprehensive and robust uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting protocol: 1) Strategy Generation: We prompt the model to propose multiple strategies for estimating uncertainty on the given query (e.g., decomposition, analogical reasoning, counterfactual analysis). 2) Strategy Execution: The model then applies each proposed strategy, generating uncertainty estimates and justifications. 3) Meta-Analysis: We prompt the model to critically evaluate each strategy's strengths and weaknesses for this specific query. 4) Synthesis: Finally, the model is asked to synthesize a final uncertainty estimate, weighing the results of different strategies based on its meta-analysis. This process leverages the model's ability to reason about its own reasoning process, potentially uncovering blind spots or biases in individual uncertainty estimation methods.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate on a diverse set of tasks including factual QA, logical reasoning, and creative problem-solving. Baselines will include individual uncertainty estimation methods and standard ensemble approaches. Metrics will include calibration measures, robustness to different query types, and human evaluation of the meta-cognitive reasoning quality. We will also analyze the diversity and effectiveness of self-generated uncertainty estimation strategies."

        "Title": "Meta-Cognitive Prompting for Robust Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods for large language models (LLMs) often fail to leverage the full range of an LLM's capabilities, leading to incomplete or biased uncertainty assessments. This problem is particularly acute in complex reasoning tasks where multiple strategies for uncertainty estimation may be applicable.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically use single prompting strategies or simple ensembles, without meta-level reasoning about the uncertainty estimation process itself. By prompting LLMs to engage in meta-cognitive reasoning about different uncertainty estimation strategies, we can obtain more comprehensive and robust uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about its own reasoning process, potentially uncovering blind spots or biases in individual uncertainty estimation methods.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks including: a) Factual QA: TriviaQA, b) Logical Reasoning: LogiQA, c) Creative Problem-Solving: CreativeQA (a custom dataset we'll create by combining creative writing prompts with problem-solving scenarios).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baselines: a) Single-strategy uncertainty estimation (e.g., softmax probabilities, Monte Carlo Dropout), b) Simple ensemble of multiple strategies, c) Standard chain-of-thought prompting for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: Meta-Cognitive Prompting Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Strategy Generation Prompt: 'Given the question [QUESTION], propose three distinct strategies for estimating the uncertainty of potential answers. Explain each strategy briefly.' b) Strategy Execution Prompt: 'Apply each of the proposed strategies to estimate uncertainty for the question [QUESTION]. Provide uncertainty estimates and justifications for each strategy.' c) Meta-Analysis Prompt: 'Critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each applied strategy for this specific question. Consider factors such as relevance, comprehensiveness, and potential biases.' d) Synthesis Prompt: 'Based on your meta-analysis, synthesize a final uncertainty estimate for the question [QUESTION]. Explain how you weighted the results of different strategies in your final estimate.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), b) Sharpness: Negative Log Likelihood (NLL), c) Robustness: Variation in uncertainty estimates across different question types, d) Human Evaluation: We will conduct a small-scale human evaluation (using researchers in our lab) to assess the quality and interpretability of the meta-cognitive reasoning process.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results, b) Run our meta-cognitive prompting method and collect results, c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and our method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare performance of our method against baselines across different tasks and metrics, b) Analyze the diversity and effectiveness of self-generated uncertainty estimation strategies, c) Examine how the meta-analysis step influences the final uncertainty estimates, d) Investigate any patterns in where our method outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Estimate your uncertainty in your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. I'm about 95% certain of this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Strategy Generation)": "Given the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?', propose three distinct strategies for estimating the uncertainty of potential answers. Explain each strategy briefly.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Strategy Generation)": "1. Historical Consensus: Examine the level of historical consensus on this fact. If there's widespread agreement, uncertainty would be low.\n2. Personal Knowledge Assessment: Reflect on personal knowledge and how it was acquired (e.g., formal education, documentaries). More reliable sources lead to lower uncertainty.\n3. Counterfactual Analysis: Consider alternative possibilities and assess their plausibility. If no plausible alternatives exist, uncertainty would be low.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Strategy Execution)": "Apply each of the proposed strategies to estimate uncertainty for the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'. Provide uncertainty estimates and justifications for each strategy.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Strategy Execution)": "1. Historical Consensus: 98% certain. There is overwhelming historical consensus that Neil Armstrong was the first person on the moon.\n2. Personal Knowledge Assessment: 95% certain. I learned this from multiple reliable sources including history books and NASA documentation.\n3. Counterfactual Analysis: 99% certain. While it's conceivable that there could have been a secret moon landing before the official one, this is extremely unlikely given the scale and public nature of the Apollo program.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Meta-Analysis)": "Critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each applied strategy for this specific question. Consider factors such as relevance, comprehensiveness, and potential biases.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Meta-Analysis)": "1. Historical Consensus: Strength - Highly relevant for well-documented historical events. Weakness - Could be biased if there's systematic misinformation.\n2. Personal Knowledge Assessment: Strength - Accounts for the model's training. Weakness - May be overly confident based on limited sources.\n3. Counterfactual Analysis: Strength - Considers alternative scenarios comprehensively. Weakness - May overestimate certainty by dismissing unlikely but possible scenarios.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Synthesis)": "Based on your meta-analysis, synthesize a final uncertainty estimate for the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'. Explain how you weighted the results of different strategies in your final estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Synthesis)": "Final uncertainty estimate: 97% certain that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. This synthesis weights the historical consensus most heavily due to the well-documented nature of this event. The personal knowledge assessment is given less weight due to potential limitations in the model's training data. The counterfactual analysis is considered but not heavily weighted as it may overestimate certainty. The small remaining uncertainty accounts for the remote possibility of undisclosed information or misinterpretation of historical records.",
            "Explanation": "The meta-cognitive prompting approach provides a more nuanced and justified uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline. It considers multiple strategies, critically evaluates them, and synthesizes a final estimate with clear reasoning, potentially leading to more robust and interpretable uncertainty quantification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed meta-cognitive prompting method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated strategies, meta-analyses, and syntheses to understand where the method falls short. This could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in meta-cognitive reasoning. 2) Experiment with different prompting techniques for each stage of our method, such as few-shot learning or chain-of-thought prompting, to see if performance can be improved. 3) Investigate how the performance of our method varies across different types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when meta-cognitive approaches are most beneficial. 4) Explore combining our method with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to create a hybrid approach. 5) If the meta-cognitive process itself proves valuable but doesn't improve uncertainty estimates, we could refocus the project on using this approach for explainable AI, where the detailed reasoning process could provide valuable insights even if it doesn't improve quantitative performance."
