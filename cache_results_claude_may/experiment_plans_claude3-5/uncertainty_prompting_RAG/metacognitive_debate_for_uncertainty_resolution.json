        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods often fail to capture the nuanced reasoning processes that contribute to model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence estimation or statistical methods applied to model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the human ability to engage in internal debate and self-reflection to resolve uncertainties, we aim to create a more sophisticated uncertainty estimation process for LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Debate for Uncertainty Resolution (MDUR). Given a query, MDUR initiates a multi-agent debate within the LLM, where different 'agents' (prompted personas) argue for different levels of confidence and potential sources of uncertainty. The debate is structured in rounds, with each round focusing on a specific aspect of uncertainty (e.g., factual knowledge, reasoning steps, potential ambiguities). Agents are prompted to provide arguments, counter-arguments, and synthesize previous points. The debate concludes with a final uncertainty estimate and a detailed breakdown of contributing factors. This process leverages the LLM's ability to approach the problem from multiple perspectives and explicitly reason about its own knowledge and limitations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MDUR against baseline uncertainty quantification methods on a diverse set of tasks, including complex reasoning problems and ambiguous queries. We'll assess not only the calibration of the final uncertainty estimates but also the quality and informativeness of the generated debates. We'll use both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis of the debate transcripts."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Debate for Uncertainty Resolution: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for large language models (LLMs) often fail to capture the nuanced reasoning processes that contribute to model uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates and potential misuse of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence estimation or statistical methods applied to model outputs. These methods often lack the sophistication to account for the complex reasoning processes that underlie model uncertainty. Inspired by the human ability to engage in internal debate and self-reflection to resolve uncertainties, we aim to create a more sophisticated uncertainty estimation process for LLMs. This approach leverages the model's own capacity for multi-perspective reasoning and explicit consideration of its knowledge limitations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Debate for Uncertainty Resolution (MDUR). Given a query, MDUR initiates a multi-agent debate within the LLM, where different 'agents' (prompted personas) argue for different levels of confidence and potential sources of uncertainty. The debate is structured in rounds, with each round focusing on a specific aspect of uncertainty (e.g., factual knowledge, reasoning steps, potential ambiguities). Agents are prompted to provide arguments, counter-arguments, and synthesize previous points. The debate concludes with a final uncertainty estimate and a detailed breakdown of contributing factors. This process leverages the LLM's ability to approach the problem from multiple perspectives and explicitly reason about its own knowledge and limitations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks to evaluate MDUR, including: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and (3) AmbigQA for ambiguous queries. These datasets cover a range of task types and difficulty levels, allowing us to assess the method's generalizability.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement and evaluate the following baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each query. (2) Ensemble method: Use multiple forward passes with different temperatures and calculate the variance of outputs. (3) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and estimate uncertainty from output distribution.",
            "Step 3: MDUR Implementation": "Implement the MDUR method with the following steps: (1) Initial response generation: Generate an initial answer to the query. (2) Debate initialization: Create 3-5 agent personas with different levels of confidence (e.g., 'Confident Expert', 'Cautious Analyst', 'Skeptic'). (3) Debate rounds: Conduct 3-5 rounds of debate, each focusing on a specific aspect of uncertainty. (4) Synthesis: Summarize the debate and generate a final confidence estimate with justification.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the MDUR process. For example: (1) Agent initialization: 'You are a [persona]. Your role is to [debate objective].' (2) Debate round: 'Consider the following aspect of uncertainty: [aspect]. Provide your perspective and respond to previous arguments.' (3) Synthesis: 'Summarize the key points of the debate and provide a final confidence estimate with justification.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. We will also test the method on GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of MDUR against baselines using the following metrics: (1) Calibration error: Compare estimated confidence with actual accuracy. (2) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (3) AUROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. (4) Qualitative analysis: Manually review a subset of debate transcripts to assess reasoning quality and uncertainty identification.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components: (1) Vary the number of debate rounds. (2) Test different agent persona combinations. (3) Compare performance with and without the synthesis step.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of results, including: (1) Compare MDUR performance across different task types. (2) Identify patterns in uncertainty sources highlighted by the debate process. (3) Assess the relationship between debate length/complexity and final confidence calibration."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence estimate without explicit consideration of potential uncertainties or alternative viewpoints."
            },
            "MDUR Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "Initial Response: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nDebate Round 1 (Factual Knowledge):\nConfident Expert: Paris is undoubtedly the capital of France. This is a well-established fact that can be easily verified.\nCautious Analyst: While Paris is indeed widely recognized as the capital, we should consider the possibility of recent changes or alternative definitions of 'capital'.\nSkeptic: Are we certain that the question isn't a trick? Could it be asking about a historical capital or a different context?\n\nDebate Round 2 (Definitions and Context):\nConfident Expert: The term 'capital' in this context clearly refers to the seat of government and the official capital city.\nCautious Analyst: That's a fair point, but we should acknowledge that there can be different types of capitals (e.g., cultural, economic) which might introduce some ambiguity.\nSkeptic: We haven't considered potential language or translation issues. Could 'capital' have a different meaning in another language that we're not accounting for?\n\nDebate Round 3 (Potential Ambiguities):\nConfident Expert: While these are interesting points, they're largely irrelevant to the straightforward nature of this question.\nCautious Analyst: I agree that the question seems straightforward, but maintaining a small degree of uncertainty is prudent.\nSkeptic: Given the simplicity of the question, I concede that major ambiguities are unlikely, but not impossible.\n\nSynthesis: After careful debate, we can conclude with high confidence that Paris is the capital of France. The straightforward nature of the question and the well-established fact leave little room for doubt. However, we acknowledge a small degree of uncertainty due to potential definitional ambiguities or unlikely recent changes.\n\nFinal Confidence Estimate: 98%\n\nJustification: The high confidence is based on the widespread recognition of Paris as France's capital and the lack of credible alternative answers. The 2% uncertainty accounts for the remote possibilities of recent changes, alternative definitions of 'capital', or potential misinterpretations of the question.",
                "Explanation": "MDUR generates a more nuanced confidence estimate by explicitly considering multiple perspectives and potential sources of uncertainty. The debate process allows for a thorough examination of the question, leading to a well-justified confidence level."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MDUR does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we will pivot to an analysis-focused project. We will conduct a detailed examination of the debate transcripts to identify patterns in reasoning and uncertainty consideration across different task types. This analysis could provide insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in metacognitive reasoning. Additionally, we will investigate whether certain components of MDUR (e.g., specific debate rounds or agent personas) show promise for improving particular aspects of uncertainty quantification. These findings could inform the development of hybrid approaches that combine elements of MDUR with traditional uncertainty estimation methods. Finally, we will explore whether the debate process, even if not directly improving calibration, provides valuable explanations for model uncertainty that could enhance interpretability and user trust in LLM outputs."
