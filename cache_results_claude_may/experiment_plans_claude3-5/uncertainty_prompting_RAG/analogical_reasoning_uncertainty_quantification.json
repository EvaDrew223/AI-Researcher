        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their uncertainty when faced with novel scenarios or when required to apply knowledge from one domain to another.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current uncertainty estimation methods typically focus on direct knowledge retrieval or statistical sampling, which may not capture the model's ability to reason by analogy.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging analogical reasoning, we can probe the model's ability to transfer knowledge between domains and better assess its uncertainty in novel or complex scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Analogical Reasoning Uncertainty Quantification (ARUQ), a prompting method that uses analogies to estimate uncertainty. Given a query, ARUQ first prompts the model to identify key concepts and relationships. It then generates a set of analogous scenarios in different domains, preserving the core relationships. The model is prompted to solve these analogous problems and explain the mapping between the original and analogous domains. ARUQ analyzes the consistency of the model's reasoning across analogies and the quality of the analogical mappings to compute an uncertainty estimate. The method also prompts the model to identify potential breakdowns in the analogies, providing insight into the limitations of its knowledge transfer. The final prompt integrates the original query, the analogous scenarios, and the derived uncertainty measure to elicit a well-calibrated response that accounts for the model's ability to reason by analogy.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Create a new benchmark dataset that requires analogical reasoning across diverse domains. Evaluate ARUQ against standard uncertainty quantification methods and analogical reasoning baselines on this dataset and adapted versions of existing benchmarks (e.g., ARC). Introduce new metrics to assess the quality and consistency of analogical mappings in relation to uncertainty estimates. Conduct a study to compare ARUQ's performance with human experts' ability to assess uncertainty in analogical reasoning tasks."

        "Title": "Analogical Reasoning Uncertainty Quantification (ARUQ): Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their uncertainty when faced with novel scenarios or when required to apply knowledge from one domain to another. This leads to overconfident predictions in unfamiliar situations and poor generalization across domains.",
        "Motivation": "Current uncertainty estimation methods typically focus on direct knowledge retrieval or statistical sampling, which may not capture the model's ability to reason by analogy. By leveraging analogical reasoning, we can probe the model's ability to transfer knowledge between domains and better assess its uncertainty in novel or complex scenarios. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often use analogies to understand and reason about unfamiliar concepts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Analogical Reasoning Uncertainty Quantification (ARUQ), a prompting method that uses analogies to estimate uncertainty. Given a query, ARUQ follows these steps:\n1. Concept Identification: Prompt the model to identify key concepts and relationships in the query.\n2. Analogy Generation: Generate a set of analogous scenarios in different domains, preserving the core relationships.\n3. Analogical Problem-Solving: Prompt the model to solve these analogous problems and explain the mapping between the original and analogous domains.\n4. Consistency Analysis: Analyze the consistency of the model's reasoning across analogies and the quality of the analogical mappings.\n5. Breakdown Identification: Prompt the model to identify potential breakdowns in the analogies, providing insight into the limitations of its knowledge transfer.\n6. Uncertainty Estimation: Compute an uncertainty estimate based on the consistency analysis and breakdown identification.\n7. Final Response: Generate a well-calibrated response that integrates the original query, the analogous scenarios, and the derived uncertainty measure.",

            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a new benchmark dataset, Analogical Reasoning Uncertainty (ARU), that requires analogical reasoning across diverse domains. This dataset should include questions from various fields (e.g., science, history, literature) that can be solved through analogical reasoning. Additionally, adapt existing benchmarks such as ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) to include analogical reasoning components.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods as baselines:\n1. Monte Carlo Dropout\n2. Deep Ensembles\n3. Temperature Scaling\n4. Calibrated Few-Shot prompting",
            "Step 3: ARUQ Implementation": "Implement the ARUQ method with the following prompts for each step:\n1. Concept Identification: \"Identify the key concepts and relationships in the following query: [QUERY]\"\n2. Analogy Generation: \"Generate three analogous scenarios in different domains that preserve the core relationships identified in the query.\"\n3. Analogical Problem-Solving: \"Solve each analogous problem and explain the mapping between the original query and the analogous scenario.\"\n4. Consistency Analysis: \"Analyze the consistency of your reasoning across the analogies. Highlight any discrepancies or variations in your approach.\"\n5. Breakdown Identification: \"Identify potential limitations or breakdowns in the analogies. Where might the analogical reasoning fail to capture important aspects of the original query?\"\n6.

            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics:\n1. Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers.\n2. Calibration Error: Compute the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess how well the model's uncertainty estimates align with its actual performance.\n3. Analogical Mapping Quality: Develop a rubric to score the quality and relevance of the generated analogies (e.g., on a scale of 1-5).\n4. Uncertainty Resolution: Measure how often the model's uncertainty estimates correctly identify instances where it makes errors.\n5. Domain Transfer: Assess the model's performance on questions that require transferring knowledge across different domains.",
            "Step 6: Experiments": "1. Compare ARUQ against baseline methods on the ARU dataset and adapted ARC benchmark.\n2. Conduct an ablation study by removing different components of ARUQ (e.g., analogy generation, breakdown identification) to assess their individual contributions.\n3. Analyze the impact of the number of generated analogies on performance and uncertainty estimation.\n4. Evaluate the method's performance across different domains and levels of question difficulty.\n5. Compare ARUQ's performance with human experts' ability to assess uncertainty in analogical reasoning tasks (using a subset of questions and a panel of domain experts).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Qualitative analysis of generated analogies and explanations.\n2. Visualization of uncertainty estimates across different question types and domains.\n3. Error analysis to identify patterns in cases where ARUQ fails or significantly outperforms baselines.\n4.

Identify an initial value\n2. Apply a constant rate of change over a fixed time period\n3. Calculate the total change by multiplying the rate by the time\n4. Add the total change to the initial value\n\nThe main variation is in the scale of the numbers used:\n- Tree growth: Units in feet, small numbers\n- Finance: Units in dollars, medium numbers\n- Population: Units in thousands of people, large numbers\n- Technology: Units in MHz, medium numbers\n\nDespite these scale differences, the underlying mathematical relationship remains the same, demonstrating the robustness of the analogy across domains.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ARUQ Step 5: Breakdown Identification)": "Identify potential limitations or breakdowns in the analogies. Where might the analogical reasoning fail to capture important aspects of the original query?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ARUQ Step 5: Breakdown Identification)": "1. Non-linear growth: The tree growth analogy assumes linear growth, which may not always be accurate for living organisms. Trees might have varying growth rates depending on factors like age, season, or environmental conditions.\n\n2. Upper limits: Unlike the tree, which can theoretically grow indefinitely, the other analogies might have practical upper limits (e.g., maximum population a town can support, or physical limits to processor speeds).\n\n3. Fractional units: The tree height can easily be measured in fractional feet, but some analogies (like population) typically use whole numbers.\n\n4. External factors: The analogies don't account for external factors that could influence growth (e.g., economic conditions for the savings account, migration for population growth, or technological breakthroughs for processor speed).\n\n5. Reversibility: While a tree typically doesn't shrink, the other analogies could potentially decrease (e.g., population decline, financial losses, or slower processors in energy-saving modes).\n\nThese limitations suggest that while the analogies are useful for understanding the basic concept, they may oversimplify the complexities of real-world scenarios.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ARUQ Step 6: Uncertainty Estimation)": "Based on your analysis of consistency and potential breakdowns, estimate your uncertainty in answering the original query on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is completely certain and 100 is completely uncertain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ARUQ Step 6: Uncertainty Estimation)": "Uncertainty estimate: 15\n\nReasoning:\n1. The problem involves simple arithmetic with clear, given values, which contributes to high certainty.\n2. The consistency across multiple analogies in different domains reinforces the underlying mathematical principle, increasing confidence.\n3. The linear growth model is straightforward and directly applicable to the given scenario.\n4. However, the identified limitations, particularly the possibility of non-linear growth in living organisms and the influence of external factors, introduce some uncertainty.\n5. The simplicity of the problem and its well-defined parameters mitigate most of these concerns for this specific scenario.\n\nTherefore, while there is high confidence in the calculated answer, a small degree of uncertainty is maintained to account for potential real-world complexities not captured in the idealized problem statement.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ARUQ Step 7: Final Response)": "Provide a final answer to the original query, incorporating your analogical reasoning and uncertainty estimate. Explain your reasoning and any caveats.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ARUQ Step 7: Final Response)": "Final Answer: The tree will be 13 feet tall after 5 years, starting from an initial height of 3 feet and growing 2 feet each year.\n\nReasoning:\nInitial height: 3 feet\nYearly growth: 2 feet\nTime period: 5 years\nTotal growth: 2 feet \u00d7 5 years = 10 feet\nFinal height: 3 feet + 10 feet = 13 feet\n\nThis answer is based on a simple linear growth model, which is supported by analogies in various domains such as finance (compound interest), population growth, and technological advancement. The consistency across these analogies reinforces the underlying mathematical principle of cumulative linear growth.\n\nUncertainty Estimate: 15 out of 100\n\nCaveats:\n1. Real tree growth may not be perfectly linear and could be influenced by factors such as age, season, and environmental conditions.\n2. The model assumes no upper limit to growth, which may not hold true for all scenarios.\n3. External factors not mentioned in the problem (e.g., disease, extreme weather) could affect the growth rate.\n\nDespite these caveats, the given problem's simplicity and well-defined parameters suggest that the calculated answer is likely to be accurate for this idealized scenario. The low uncertainty reflects high confidence in the mathematical calculation while acknowledging the potential for real-world complexities not captured in the problem statement.",
            "explanation": "The ARUQ method provides a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to answering the question compared to the baseline method. It not only calculates the correct answer but also generates analogies, analyzes consistency, identifies potential limitations, and provides an uncertainty estimate. This process allows for a deeper understanding of the problem and a more informed final response that acknowledges potential real-world complexities."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ARUQ method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification or confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated analogies, examining their relevance, diversity, and complexity in relation to the original problems. This could provide insights into the model's ability to transfer knowledge across domains and identify potential limitations in its analogical reasoning capabilities. Second, we could investigate the relationship between the quality of generated analogies and the accuracy of uncertainty estimates, potentially revealing patterns that could inform improved prompting strategies or alternative uncertainty quantification methods. Third, we could explore combining ARUQ with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibrated few-shot learning, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. Finally, if the analogical reasoning component proves challenging, we could refocus the project on analyzing the model's explanations and reasoning processes across different domains, potentially uncovering insights into how LLMs handle domain transfer and conceptual understanding in relation to uncertainty estimation."
