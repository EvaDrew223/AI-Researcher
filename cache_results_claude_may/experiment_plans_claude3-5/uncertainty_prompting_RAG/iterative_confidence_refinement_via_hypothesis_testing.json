        "Problem": "LLMs often produce overconfident predictions, especially when dealing with ambiguous or partially correct information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on one-shot confidence estimation or simple iterative refinement without structured hypothesis testing.",
        "Motivation": "Scientific inquiry often involves iterative hypothesis testing to refine confidence in conclusions. We propose adapting this approach to improve LLMs' confidence calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Iterative Confidence Refinement via Hypothesis Testing (ICRHT). The prompting procedure involves: 1) Initial answer generation with a confidence estimate. 2) Formulating multiple hypotheses that could potentially invalidate or support the answer. 3) For each hypothesis, prompting the model to design a 'test' (e.g., a follow-up question or a specific piece of information to check). 4) Simulating the execution of these tests and updating the confidence based on the outcomes. 5) Repeating steps 2-4 for multiple iterations, gradually refining the confidence estimate. This approach encourages the model to actively seek out potential flaws in its reasoning and adjust its confidence accordingly.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare ICRHT against baseline confidence estimation methods on tasks from datasets like TruthfulQA and AdvQA that involve ambiguous or partially correct information. Evaluate using metrics such as expected calibration error, confidence-correctness correlation, and the ability to identify high-uncertainty instances."

        "Title": "Iterative Confidence Refinement via Hypothesis Testing (ICRHT): Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce overconfident predictions, especially when dealing with ambiguous or partially correct information. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications and hinder the model's ability to express uncertainty appropriately.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to confidence calibration in LLMs typically focus on one-shot confidence estimation or simple iterative refinement without structured hypothesis testing. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties present in complex reasoning tasks. Scientific inquiry, on the other hand, involves iterative hypothesis testing to refine confidence in conclusions. By adapting this approach to LLMs, we aim to improve their confidence calibration and uncertainty quantification, leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Iterative Confidence Refinement via Hypothesis Testing (ICRHT), a novel prompting procedure that encourages LLMs to actively seek out potential flaws in their reasoning and adjust their confidence accordingly. The method involves five key steps: 1) Initial answer generation with a confidence estimate. 2) Formulating multiple hypotheses that could potentially invalidate or support the answer. 3) For each hypothesis, prompting the model to design a 'test' (e.g., a follow-up question or a specific piece of information to check). 4) Simulating the execution of these tests and updating the confidence based on the outcomes. 5) Repeating steps 2-4 for multiple iterations, gradually refining the confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA and AdvQA datasets, which contain questions involving ambiguous or partially correct information. These datasets are particularly suitable for evaluating confidence calibration and uncertainty quantification.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Temperature scaling, and 3) Monte Carlo Dropout. For direct prompting, we'll use a prompt like 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'. For temperature scaling and MC Dropout, we'll use standard implementations from existing libraries.",
            "Step 3: ICRHT Implementation": "Implement the ICRHT method with the following prompts for each step: 1) Initial answer: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' 2) Hypothesis generation: 'Generate 3 hypotheses that could potentially invalidate or support your answer to the question: [QUESTION] Your answer: [ANSWER]' 3) Test design: 'For each hypothesis, design a specific test (e.g., a follow-up question or information to check) that could help validate or invalidate it: [HYPOTHESES]' 4) Test execution: 'Based on your knowledge, simulate the outcome of each test and explain how it affects the original answer and confidence: [TESTS]' 5) Confidence update: 'Given the test outcomes, provide an updated answer and confidence score from 0 to 100 for the original question: [QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely used, making our results relevant and comparable to other studies.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: 1) Apply all baseline methods and record their confidence estimates. 2) Apply ICRHT for 3 iterations, recording the confidence estimate after each iteration. 3) Store all intermediate outputs (hypotheses, tests, outcomes) for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Confidence-Correctness Correlation: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between confidence scores and correctness of answers. 3) Identification of High-Uncertainty Instances: Compute the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for identifying incorrect answers based on confidence scores. 4) Qualitative Analysis: Manually review a subset of examples to assess the quality and relevance of generated hypotheses and tests.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Visualization": "1) Plot calibration curves for each method, showing the relationship between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Create box plots comparing the distribution of confidence scores for correct and incorrect answers across methods. 3) Generate line plots showing how confidence evolves over ICRHT iterations for different question types. 4) Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare ICRHT against baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence score: 95"
            },
            "ICRHT Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Answer": {
                    "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                    "Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence score: 95"
                },
                "Step 2 - Hypothesis Generation": {
                    "Input": "Generate 3 hypotheses that could potentially invalidate or support your answer to the question: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?' Your answer: Neil Armstrong",
                    "Output": "1. There might be conflicting historical records about the first moon landing.\n2. Buzz Aldrin, who was also on the Apollo 11 mission, might have stepped out first.\n3. There could be conspiracy theories claiming the moon landing was faked."
                },
                "Step 3 - Test Design": {
                    "Input": "For each hypothesis, design a specific test (e.g., a follow-up question or information to check) that could help validate or invalidate it: [HYPOTHESES from Step 2]",
                    "Output": "1. Check NASA's official records and multiple reputable historical sources for consistency in reporting Neil Armstrong as the first person on the moon.\n2. Verify the exact sequence of events during the Apollo 11 moon landing, including who exited the lunar module first.\n3. Examine the credibility of moon landing conspiracy theories and the scientific consensus on the reality of the Apollo missions."
                },
                "Step 4 - Test Execution": {
                    "Input": "Based on your knowledge, simulate the outcome of each test and explain how it affects the original answer and confidence: [TESTS from Step 3]",
                    "Output": "1. NASA's records and reputable historical sources consistently report Neil Armstrong as the first person on the moon. This supports the original answer and maintains high confidence.\n2. The sequence of events confirms that Neil Armstrong exited the lunar module first, followed by Buzz Aldrin. This further supports the original answer and increases confidence.\n3. While conspiracy theories exist, they are widely debunked by scientific evidence and expert consensus. The moon landing is accepted as a historical fact. This doesn't directly affect the answer about who was first, but it reinforces the overall confidence in the moon landing event."
                },
                "Step 5 - Confidence Update": {
                    "Input": "Given the test outcomes, provide an updated answer and confidence score from 0 to 100 for the original question: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                    "Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Updated confidence score: 99"
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score without any self-reflection or verification. In contrast, ICRHT generates relevant hypotheses, designs specific tests, and simulates their outcomes. This process allows the model to consider potential uncertainties and adjust its confidence accordingly. In this case, the additional verification slightly increased the confidence score from 95 to 99, as all tests supported the original answer. For more ambiguous questions, we would expect to see larger adjustments in confidence, potentially decreasing it when uncertainties are identified."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ICRHT doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated hypotheses and tests to understand why they aren't effectively capturing uncertainties. This might reveal interesting patterns in how LLMs reason about their own knowledge. Second, we could experiment with variations of ICRHT, such as using different prompting strategies for hypothesis generation or incorporating external knowledge sources for test execution. Third, we could focus on specific types of questions or domains where ICRHT shows the most promise, potentially uncovering niche applications where this approach is particularly effective. Lastly, we could compare ICRHT's performance across different model sizes and architectures to investigate how self-reflection capabilities scale with model complexity. These analyses could provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning and uncertainty quantification, even if the original method doesn't outperform baselines across all metrics."
