        "Problem": "LLMs often lack a realistic assessment of the potential flaws or limitations in their own responses, leading to overconfidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing self-evaluation techniques typically involve direct self-assessment or simple verifications, which can be prone to bias.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a peer review process, we can encourage the model to critically examine its own responses from multiple perspectives, potentially uncovering uncertainties it might have initially overlooked.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Hypothetical Peer Review Simulation, a prompting technique that guides the LLM through a simulated academic peer review process for its own responses. The steps include: 1) Prompt the model to generate an initial response and confidence score. 2) Ask the model to assume the role of three different peer reviewers, each with a distinct expertise relevant to the question. 3) For each reviewer role, prompt the model to critically evaluate the initial response, highlighting potential flaws, limitations, or areas of uncertainty. 4) Guide the model to synthesize the peer review feedback and revise its initial response and confidence score accordingly. 5) Finally, prompt the model to provide a meta-analysis of the peer review process, explicitly discussing how the simulated feedback affected its confidence assessment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate this method on complex reasoning tasks and open-ended question datasets. Compare the calibration quality and answer improvements against standard confidence elicitation and self-evaluation techniques. Analyze how the diversity and depth of the simulated peer reviews impact the final uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Hypothetical Peer Review Simulation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack a realistic assessment of the potential flaws or limitations in their own responses, leading to overconfidence. This overconfidence can result in the propagation of misinformation or poor decision-making when these models are used in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing self-evaluation techniques for LLMs typically involve direct self-assessment or simple verifications, which can be prone to bias. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties that might be present in complex reasoning tasks. By simulating a peer review process, we can encourage the model to critically examine its own responses from multiple perspectives, potentially uncovering uncertainties it might have initially overlooked. This approach leverages the model's ability to assume different expert roles and apply domain-specific knowledge, which could lead to more comprehensive and realistic uncertainty assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Hypothetical Peer Review Simulation (HPRS), a prompting technique that guides the LLM through a simulated academic peer review process for its own responses. The steps include: 1) Prompt the model to generate an initial response and confidence score. 2) Ask the model to assume the role of three different peer reviewers, each with a distinct expertise relevant to the question. 3) For each reviewer role, prompt the model to critically evaluate the initial response, highlighting potential flaws, limitations, or areas of uncertainty. 4) Guide the model to synthesize the peer review feedback and revise its initial response and confidence score accordingly. 5) Finally, prompt the model to provide a meta-analysis of the peer review process, explicitly discussing how the simulated feedback affected its confidence assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for evaluation: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual accuracy and uncertainty, 2) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for evaluating performance on complex reasoning tasks, and 3) ARC-Challenge for science question answering. These datasets cover a range of domains and difficulty levels, allowing us to test the method's effectiveness across various scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct prompting (asking the question directly), b) Simple confidence elicitation (asking the model to provide a confidence score after its answer), c) Self-consistency (generating multiple answers and taking the majority), d) Chain-of-Thought prompting with confidence estimation.",
            "Step 3: HPRS Implementation": "Implement the Hypothetical Peer Review Simulation method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation, b) Peer reviewer role assignment, c) Critical evaluation by each reviewer, d) Feedback synthesis and response revision, e) Meta-analysis of the review process.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design effective prompts for each step of the HPRS process. For example: 'You are an expert in [specific field]. Please critically evaluate the following response, highlighting any potential flaws, limitations, or areas of uncertainty: [initial response]'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: percentage of correct answers, 2) Calibration error: difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy, 3) Brier score: measures both calibration and resolution of probabilistic predictions, 4) F1 score: for questions with multiple correct answers.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments for each dataset using both baseline methods and HPRS. For HPRS, we will use three iterations of peer review for each question. Record the initial and final answers, confidence scores, and intermediate peer review feedback.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of HPRS against baseline methods across all metrics. Analyze how the peer review process affects the model's responses and confidence scores. Examine the quality and diversity of the generated peer review feedback.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of HPRS: a) Vary the number of peer reviewers, b) Remove the meta-analysis step, c) Use a single generalist reviewer instead of domain-specific reviewers.",
            "Step 10: Error Analysis": "Perform a detailed error analysis on a subset of questions where HPRS performs significantly better or worse than baselines. Identify patterns in the types of questions or domains where the method is most effective."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Peer Review)": "You are an expert historian specializing in European capitals. Please critically evaluate the following response, highlighting any potential flaws, limitations, or areas of uncertainty: 'The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Peer Review)": "As an expert historian, I can confirm that the answer 'Paris' is correct. However, the confidence score of 100 might be slightly overstated. While Paris is indeed the current capital of France and has been for centuries, there are a few historical nuances to consider:\n\n1. Historical changes: France has had other capitals in its history. For example, during World War II, Vichy served as the capital of the collaborationist French State from 1940 to 1944.\n\n2. Definition of 'capital': Depending on the specific context or time period in question, one might need to differentiate between the political capital, economic capital, or cultural capital.\n\n3. Potential for future changes: While highly unlikely, it's theoretically possible for a country to change its capital, as has happened in other nations.\n\nGiven these considerations, a more nuanced confidence score might be 98 or 99, acknowledging the small possibility of contextual or historical complications while still reflecting the high certainty of the answer for most practical purposes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Final Response)": "Based on the peer review feedback, please provide a revised answer and confidence score for the question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Final Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. While this is correct for the current era and has been true for centuries, it's worth noting that France has had other capitals in its history, such as Vichy during World War II. Additionally, the concept of a 'capital' can sometimes vary depending on whether we're referring to the political, economic, or cultural center. However, for all practical modern purposes, Paris is unequivocally recognized as the capital of France. Revised confidence score: 99",
            "Explanation": "The HPRS method encourages a more nuanced and thoughtful response. While the initial answer was correct, the peer review process prompted the model to consider historical context and potential ambiguities, leading to a slightly reduced but more justifiable confidence score. This demonstrates how HPRS can help in producing more calibrated and informative responses."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed HPRS method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification or calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated peer reviews to understand why they didn't lead to improved calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of feedback provided and their relevance to uncertainty estimation. 2) Investigate whether HPRS is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply such methods. 3) Explore variations of the peer review process, such as incorporating a 'devil's advocate' reviewer specifically tasked with finding flaws in the initial response. 4) Combine HPRS with other techniques like calibrated few-shot prompting or ensemble methods to see if there are synergistic effects. 5) Conduct a qualitative analysis of how HPRS affects the explanations and reasoning provided by the model, even if it doesn't improve quantitative metrics. This could offer insights into how such methods influence the model's thought process and potentially lead to new approaches for improving LLM reasoning and uncertainty estimation."
