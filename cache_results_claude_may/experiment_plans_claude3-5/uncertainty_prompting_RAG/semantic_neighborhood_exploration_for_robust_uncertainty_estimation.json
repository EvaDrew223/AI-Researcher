        "Problem": "LLMs often provide unreliable confidence estimates when faced with inputs that are semantically similar but contextually distinct from their training data.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on the given input alone, without exploring its semantic neighborhood to gauge robustness and uncertainty.",

        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Robust Uncertainty Estimation (SNEURE), a prompting strategy that probes the semantic space around a given input: 1) Initial response: Obtain the LLM's answer and confidence for the original input. 2) Semantic variation generation: Prompt the LLM to generate semantically similar but distinct variations of the input. 3) Neighborhood sampling: Systematically query the LLM with these variations, collecting responses and confidence estimates. 4) Stability analysis: Guide the LLM to analyze the stability of its responses and confidence across the semantic neighborhood. 5) Edge case identification: Prompt the LLM to identify edge cases or boundary conditions where its confidence significantly changes. 6) Robust uncertainty synthesis: Direct the LLM to synthesize a robust uncertainty estimate that accounts for stability across the semantic neighborhood and identified edge cases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SNEURE against standard confidence estimation methods on tasks sensitive to semantic variations, such as sentiment analysis, intent classification, and open-ended question answering.

        "Title": "SNEURE: Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Robust Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide unreliable confidence estimates when faced with inputs that are semantically similar but contextually distinct from their training data. This leads to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution inputs and poor calibration, which can be problematic in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on the given input alone, without exploring its semantic neighborhood to gauge robustness and uncertainty. By systematically exploring semantically related inputs, we can assess the stability of an LLM's responses and confidence, leading to more robust uncertainty estimates. This method leverages the LLM's own capabilities to generate and analyze semantic variations, potentially offering a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence across a range of related inputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Robust Uncertainty Estimation (SNEURE), a prompting strategy that probes the semantic space around a given input: 1) Initial response: Obtain the LLM's answer and confidence for the original input. 2) Semantic variation generation: Prompt the LLM to generate semantically similar but distinct variations of the input. 3) Neighborhood sampling: Systematically query the LLM with these variations, collecting responses and confidence estimates. 4) Stability analysis: Guide the LLM to analyze the stability of its responses and confidence across the semantic neighborhood. 5) Edge case identification: Prompt the LLM to identify edge cases or boundary conditions where its confidence significantly changes. 6) Robust uncertainty synthesis: Direct the LLM to synthesize a robust uncertainty estimate that accounts for stability across the semantic neighborhood and identified edge cases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate SNEURE: 1) SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference) for sentiment analysis, 2) CLINC150 for intent classification, and 3) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering. These datasets cover a range of tasks and allow us to assess the method's performance across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation methods as baselines: 1) Direct prompting: Ask the LLM to provide an answer and confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to calibrate confidence. 3) Ensemble method: Use multiple LLM calls and aggregate results.",
            "Step 3: SNEURE Implementation": "Implement the SNEURE method with the following steps: 1) Initial response: Prompt the LLM with 'Given the input \"{input}\", provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.' 2) Semantic variation generation: Prompt with 'Generate 5 semantically similar but distinct variations of the input \"{input}\".' 3) Neighborhood sampling: For each variation, use the prompt from step 1. 4) Stability analysis: Prompt with 'Analyze the stability of the responses and confidence scores across the original input and its variations. Provide a stability score from 0 to 100.' 5) Edge case identification: Prompt with 'Identify any edge cases or boundary conditions where the confidence significantly changed. List them if any.' 6) Robust uncertainty synthesis: Prompt with 'Based on the original confidence score, stability analysis, and identified edge cases, synthesize a robust uncertainty estimate. Provide a final confidence score from 0 to 100 and a brief explanation.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art LLMs and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of SNEURE against the baselines: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier Score: Assesses the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Semantic Neighborhood Stability (SNS): A new metric we introduce, calculated as the average similarity of responses across semantic variations. 4) Edge Case Detection Rate (ECDR): The proportion of identified edge cases that lead to significant confidence changes.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run baseline methods and collect results. 2) Run SNEURE method and collect results. 3) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and SNEURE results.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare SNEURE performance against baselines using the defined metrics. 2) Analyze the impact of semantic neighborhood exploration on confidence estimation. 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of edge case identification in improving uncertainty estimates. 4) Assess the correlation between synthesized robust uncertainty estimates and actual performance variability across semantic variations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Classify the sentiment of the following sentence: 'The movie was not bad, but I've seen better.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Sentiment: Neutral\nConfidence: 80%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Given the input \"Classify the sentiment of the following sentence: 'The movie was not bad, but I've seen better.'\", provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Answer: The sentiment of the sentence is Neutral.\nConfidence score: 75",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Semantic Variation Generation)": "Generate 5 semantically similar but distinct variations of the input \"Classify the sentiment of the following sentence: 'The movie was not bad, but I've seen better.'\"",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Semantic Variation Generation)": "1. Determine the emotional tone of this statement: 'The film wasn't terrible, though I've experienced superior ones.'\n2. Assess the overall feeling expressed in: 'While the movie wasn't awful, I can recall watching more impressive films.'\n3. Evaluate the sentiment behind: 'The cinema experience was decent, yet not the best I've encountered.'\n4. Analyze the mood conveyed by: 'I don't have major complaints about the movie, but it didn't blow me away.'\n5. Interpret the attitude in this phrase: 'The film was okay, but there are better options out there.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 6: Robust Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the original confidence score, stability analysis, and identified edge cases, synthesize a robust uncertainty estimate. Provide a final confidence score from 0 to 100 and a brief explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 6: Robust Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final confidence score: 65\nExplanation: The original confidence of 75 was slightly overestimated. The semantic variations revealed some instability in sentiment classification, particularly when the phrasing became more positive or negative. Edge cases where the sentiment could be interpreted as slightly positive or slightly negative were identified. Considering these factors, a more conservative confidence score of 65 better reflects the uncertainty in classifying this borderline neutral sentiment.",
            "Explanation": "SNEURE provides a more nuanced and robust uncertainty estimate by exploring semantic variations and analyzing the stability of responses. The final confidence score is lower and better calibrated than the baseline, reflecting the inherent ambiguity in the sentiment of the given sentence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SNEURE does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality and diversity of generated semantic variations to ensure they're providing meaningful exploration of the input space. 2) The LLM's ability to perform meta-analysis on its own responses, which could lead to insights on improving prompts for self-analysis. 3) The relationship between semantic neighborhood stability and actual prediction accuracy, which could inform new metrics for uncertainty estimation. 4) The effectiveness of the edge case identification step, potentially leading to a focused study on detecting and handling edge cases in LLM responses. These analyses could result in a paper that provides valuable insights into the challenges and potential directions for improving uncertainty estimation in LLMs, even if the original method doesn't yield the expected improvements."
