    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence, particularly in domains where they lack explicit feedback or training.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically rely on supervised fine-tuning or simple heuristics based on output probabilities.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a peer review process, we can leverage the model's ability to critique and refine its own outputs, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced confidence calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting protocol that mimics an academic peer review process. First, the model generates an initial response and confidence estimate. Then, it's prompted to assume the role of multiple 'peer reviewers' with different expertise, each critiquing the initial response and confidence estimate. The model, now in the role of the 'author', must then respond to these reviews, potentially adjusting its answer and confidence. This process iterates, with the model switching between roles, until a consensus is reached or a predefined number of rounds is completed. We also incorporate a 'meta-reviewer' role that synthesizes the peer reviews and guides the overall calibration process. Throughout this simulation, we employ specially designed prompts that encourage the model to focus on calibrating its confidence rather than just improving its answer.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate this method across a diverse set of tasks, including scientific reasoning, creative writing, and ethical decision-making. Baselines will include standard confidence elicitation techniques and simpler self-reflection methods. Key metrics will include calibration error, the Brier score, and a novel 'calibration convergence rate' that measures how quickly the model achieves stable calibration through the peer review process."

        "Title": "Peer Review Prompting: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Simulated Academic Discourse",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence, particularly in domains where they lack explicit feedback or training. This can lead to overconfident assertions in areas of uncertainty or underconfidence in areas of expertise, potentially misleading users and limiting the models' practical utility.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods typically rely on supervised fine-tuning or simple heuristics based on output probabilities, which may not capture the nuanced reasoning required for accurate confidence estimation. By simulating a peer review process, we can leverage the model's ability to critique and refine its own outputs, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced confidence calibration. This approach mimics the academic process of peer review, where initial claims are scrutinized, debated, and refined, ultimately leading to more robust and well-calibrated conclusions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting protocol that mimics an academic peer review process. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Initial Response: The model generates an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Peer Review: The model assumes the role of multiple 'peer reviewers' with different expertise, each critiquing the initial response and confidence estimate. 3) Author Response: The model, as the 'author', responds to these reviews, potentially adjusting its answer and confidence. 4) Meta-Review: A 'meta-reviewer' role synthesizes the peer reviews and guides the overall calibration process. 5) Final Decision: The model produces a final answer and confidence estimate based on the entire discourse. This process iterates until a consensus is reached or a predefined number of rounds is completed. Throughout this simulation, we employ specially designed prompts that encourage the model to focus on calibrating its confidence rather than just improving its answer.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, and 3) Ethics for ethical decision-making. These datasets cover a range of domains and difficulty levels, allowing us to assess the method's generalizability.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate. 2) Temperature scaling: use different temperature settings to calibrate the model's confidence. 3) Self-consistency: generate multiple answers and use their agreement as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: Peer Review Prompting Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response generation, b) Peer reviewer role assignment and review generation, c) Author response generation, d) Meta-review synthesis, e) Final decision generation. Design prompts for each step that encourage focus on confidence calibration.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model, with GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude 2 as comparison models to assess generalizability across different LLMs.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run all baseline methods and the proposed method. b) Collect model outputs, including intermediate steps for the peer review process. c) Record the final answers and confidence estimates.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the results using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: assess both calibration and resolution of probabilistic predictions. 3) Calibration convergence rate: measure how quickly the model achieves stable calibration through the peer review process. 4) Answer quality: assess the correctness of the final answers compared to ground truth.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of calibration performance across methods and datasets. b) Analysis of the peer review discourse to identify patterns in how the model critiques and refines its confidence. c) Investigation of cases where peer review prompting significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%) in your response.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%) in your response. Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%\nReasoning: Paris has been the capital of France for centuries and is widely known as such. It's the political, economic, and cultural center of the country, housing major government institutions like the National Assembly and the official residence of the French President.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Peer Review)": "You are a peer reviewer. Critically evaluate the following response, focusing on the appropriateness of the confidence level. Suggest adjustments if necessary:\n[Insert Initial Response]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Peer Review)": "Evaluation: The answer provided is correct, and the high confidence level of 99% is generally appropriate for this widely known fact. However, it's worth considering whether 99% confidence is too high for any claim, as there's always a small possibility of error or change.\nSuggestion: Consider slightly lowering the confidence to 95-98% to account for the small possibility of recent changes or errors in common knowledge. Provide additional context about Paris's long-standing status as the capital to further justify the high confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Author Response)": "As the original author, respond to the peer review, explaining whether you agree with the suggestions and why. If you choose to modify your answer or confidence level, please provide the updated response.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Author Response)": "I appreciate the peer reviewer's thoughtful feedback. Upon reflection, I agree that a 99% confidence level might be slightly too high, as it's important to always leave room for the possibility of error or recent changes, even for well-established facts.\nUpdated response: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98%\nReasoning: Paris has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages and continues to serve as the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. Major government institutions, including the National Assembly and the official residence of the French President, are located in Paris. While this is a well-established fact, we maintain a 98% confidence level to account for the small possibility of very recent changes or errors in common knowledge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Final Decision)": "Based on the initial response, peer review, and author response, provide a final answer and confidence level for the question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Final Decision)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nConfidence: 98%\nExplanation: This final decision maintains the high confidence level while acknowledging the small possibility of error or change suggested in the peer review process. The slight reduction from 99% to 98% reflects a more nuanced and cautious approach to confidence estimation, even for well-established facts.",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how the peer review prompting process can lead to more nuanced and well-calibrated confidence estimates. The initial high confidence of 99% was slightly adjusted based on the peer review suggestion, resulting in a final confidence of 98% that better reflects the small uncertainty inherent in any claim. This process encourages the model to think critically about its confidence levels and provide more robust justifications for its estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed peer review prompting method does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the peer review discourse to understand why the method didn't lead to improved calibration. This could involve categorizing types of critiques and responses, and examining how they relate to final confidence estimates. 2) Investigate whether the method improves other aspects of model output, such as answer quality or explanation coherence, even if confidence calibration isn't significantly improved. 3) Experiment with variations of the peer review process, such as increasing the number of review rounds, introducing specific expertise to reviewers, or incorporating external knowledge sources into the review process. 4) Explore combining peer review prompting with other calibration methods, such as temperature scaling or ensemble techniques, to create a hybrid approach. 5) Shift focus to using the peer review process as a tool for generating more diverse and nuanced responses to questions, rather than solely for confidence calibration. This could lead to insights about how LLMs can be used to simulate academic discourse and generate more comprehensive answers to complex questions."
