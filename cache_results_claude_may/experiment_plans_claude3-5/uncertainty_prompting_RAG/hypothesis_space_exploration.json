        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple hypotheses could be plausible.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-path reasoning or limited sampling strategies, which may not fully capture the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring a diverse set of hypotheses, we can better map the model's uncertainty and identify areas of high confidence or confusion.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hypothesis Space Exploration (HSE), a prompting technique that guides the model to generate and evaluate multiple hypotheses for a given query. The process involves: 1) Hypothesis Generation: Prompt the model to generate a diverse set of potential answers or explanations. 2) Evidence Gathering: For each hypothesis, prompt the model to list supporting and contradicting evidence. 3) Confidence Scoring: Ask the model to assign confidence scores to each hypothesis based on the evidence. 4) Uncertainty Quantification: Analyze the distribution of confidence scores across hypotheses to estimate overall uncertainty. 5) Meta-Analysis: Prompt the model to reflect on the hypothesis space, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement.",

        "Title": "Hypothesis Space Exploration: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Systematic Reasoning",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple hypotheses could be plausible. This issue is particularly pronounced in scenarios requiring nuanced understanding or where the model's knowledge might be incomplete or conflicting.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-path reasoning or limited sampling strategies, which may not fully capture the model's uncertainty landscape. By systematically exploring a diverse set of hypotheses, we can better map the model's uncertainty and identify areas of high confidence or confusion. This approach is inspired by human reasoning processes, where we often consider multiple possibilities before arriving at a conclusion, especially in complex or ambiguous situations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hypothesis Space Exploration (HSE), a prompting technique that guides the model to generate and evaluate multiple hypotheses for a given query. The process involves five key steps: 1) Hypothesis Generation: Prompt the model to generate a diverse set of potential answers or explanations. 2) Evidence Gathering: For each hypothesis, prompt the model to list supporting and contradicting evidence. 3) Confidence Scoring: Ask the model to assign confidence scores to each hypothesis based on the evidence. 4) Uncertainty Quantification: Analyze the distribution of confidence scores across hypotheses to estimate overall uncertainty. 5) Meta-Analysis: Prompt the model to reflect on the hypothesis space, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, and 3) StrategyQA for multi-hop reasoning. These datasets cover a range of reasoning tasks with varying levels of complexity and potential for uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Temperature sampling (generate multiple answers with temperature=0.7), and 3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.",
            "Step 4: HSE Implementation": "Implement the Hypothesis Space Exploration method with the following steps: a) Hypothesis Generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 distinct hypotheses. b) Evidence Gathering: For each hypothesis, prompt for 2-3 pieces of supporting and contradicting evidence. c) Confidence Scoring: Ask the model to assign a confidence score (0-100) to each hypothesis. d) Uncertainty Quantification: Calculate the entropy of the confidence score distribution. e) Meta-Analysis: Prompt the model to summarize areas of agreement and disagreement across hypotheses.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and HSE): a) Process all questions through the respective prompting strategy. b) For HSE and temperature sampling, generate 5 responses per question. c) For standard and CoT prompting, generate 1 response per question.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the methods using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration Error: Difference between confidence and accuracy. 3) Brier Score: Measures both calibration and resolution of probabilistic predictions. 4) Human Evaluation: Recruit 3 expert annotators to rate the quality and plausibility of reasoning for a subset of 100 questions per dataset.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct the following analyses: 1) Compare HSE performance against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze the relationship between entropy of confidence scores and accuracy. 3) Examine cases where HSE significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. 4) Investigate the impact of the number of hypotheses on performance and uncertainty estimation."

The boiling point of water on top of Mount Everest is the same as at sea level, 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (HSE; Step 2: Evidence Gathering)": "For each hypothesis about the boiling point of water on top of Mount Everest, provide 2-3 pieces of supporting and contradicting evidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (HSE; Step 2: Evidence Gathering)": "Hypothesis 1 (70\u00b0C):\nSupporting Evidence:\n- At high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower, which reduces the boiling point of water.\n- The summit of Everest is at 8,848 meters, where air pressure is about one-third of sea level.\nContradicting Evidence:\n- Some sources cite slightly different temperatures for the boiling point at this altitude.\n\nHypothesis 2 (80\u00b0C):\nSupporting Evidence:\n- This temperature is between sea level boiling point and the commonly cited Everest boiling point.\nContradicting Evidence:\n- Most reliable sources indicate a lower boiling point on Everest.\n- The air pressure on Everest is too low to support this high of a boiling point.\n\nHypothesis 3 (60\u00b0C):\nSupporting Evidence:\n- This temperature acknowledges the significant drop in boiling point due to low pressure.\nContradicting Evidence:\n- Most scientific calculations and measurements indicate a slightly higher boiling point.\n- 60\u00b0C might be too low given the specific altitude of Everest.\n\nHypothesis 4 (100\u00b0C):\nSupporting Evidence:\n- This is the standard boiling point of water at sea level.\nContradicting Evidence:\n- This ignores the effect of altitude on boiling point.\n- Numerous scientific sources and experiments contradict this claim for high altitudes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (HSE; Step 3: Confidence Scoring)": "Based on the evidence provided, assign a confidence score (0-100) to each hypothesis about the boiling point of water on top of Mount Everest.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (HSE; Step 3: Confidence Scoring)": "Hypothesis 1 (70\u00b0C): Confidence Score = 85\nHypothesis 2 (80\u00b0C): Confidence Score = 20\nHypothesis 3 (60\u00b0C): Confidence Score = 40\nHypothesis 4 (100\u00b0C): Confidence Score = 5",

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (HSE; Step 4: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Entropy = 1.43 bits",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (HSE; Step 5: Meta-Analysis)": "Summarize the areas of agreement and disagreement across the hypotheses about the boiling point of water on top of Mount Everest.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (HSE; Step 5: Meta-Analysis)": "Areas of Agreement:\n- All hypotheses except one acknowledge that the boiling point of water on Mount Everest is lower than at sea level.\n- There is a consensus that atmospheric pressure plays a crucial role in determining the boiling point.\n\nAreas of Disagreement:\n- The exact temperature of the boiling point varies across hypotheses, ranging from 60\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C.\n- There is disagreement on the magnitude of the effect of altitude on the boiling point.\n- One hypothesis (100\u00b0C) stands out as an outlier, ignoring the effect of altitude entirely.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the evidence and confidence scores, the most likely boiling point of water on top of Mount Everest is around 70\u00b0C. However, there is some uncertainty, particularly between the 60\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C estimates. The 80\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C hypotheses are less likely to be correct based on the available evidence.",
            "explanation": "The HSE method provides a more comprehensive exploration of the problem space, considering multiple hypotheses and evaluating them based on evidence. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the uncertainty involved in the question, as reflected in the confidence scores and meta-analysis. In contrast, the standard prompting method provides a single answer without any indication of uncertainty or alternative possibilities."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed HSE method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality and diversity of generated hypotheses - are they truly distinct and relevant? 2) The accuracy and relevance of the evidence gathered for each hypothesis. 3) The model's ability to assign meaningful confidence scores - are they well-calibrated? 4) The effectiveness of our entropy-based uncertainty quantification - does it correlate well with actual uncertainty? We could also explore alternative uncertainty metrics, such as variance of confidence scores or the number of high-confidence hypotheses. Additionally, we could analyze how the performance of HSE varies across different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning-based) to identify strengths and weaknesses of the approach. This analysis could lead to insights about the nature of uncertainty in LLMs and potentially inspire new, more effective methods for uncertainty quantification."
