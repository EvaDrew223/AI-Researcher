    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often struggle to capture the multi-scale nature of uncertainty, leading to incomplete or inaccurate confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-scale uncertainty estimates or simple ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by fractal mathematics, we propose that uncertainty in language models may have a self-similar structure across different scales of abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Uncertainty Prompting, a multi-scale approach to uncertainty quantification. The method involves recursively prompting the model to estimate its uncertainty at increasingly fine-grained levels of detail. Starting with a high-level question, we prompt the model to break it down into sub-questions, estimate uncertainty for each, and then recursively apply this process to sub-questions. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to consider different aspects of uncertainty at each level, such as factual knowledge, logical reasoning, and contextual understanding. We aggregate these multi-scale uncertainty estimates using a novel fractal dimension-inspired metric, providing a more comprehensive view of the model's confidence across different levels of abstraction.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method against standard uncertainty quantification techniques on a range of tasks including open-ended question answering, factual recall, and logical reasoning. We'll use metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and a new metric we term 'fractal uncertainty consistency' to assess the quality and coherence of uncertainty estimates across scales."

        "Title": "Fractal Uncertainty Prompting: A Multi-Scale Approach to Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often struggle to capture the multi-scale nature of uncertainty, leading to incomplete or inaccurate confidence estimates. This problem is particularly acute in complex reasoning tasks where uncertainty can manifest at different levels of abstraction.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-scale uncertainty estimates or simple ensemble methods, which fail to capture the hierarchical nature of uncertainty in language models. Inspired by fractal mathematics, we propose that uncertainty in language models may have a self-similar structure across different scales of abstraction. This insight motivates our multi-scale approach to uncertainty quantification, which we believe will provide a more comprehensive and accurate representation of model confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Uncertainty Prompting (FUP), a multi-scale approach to uncertainty quantification. The method involves recursively prompting the model to estimate its uncertainty at increasingly fine-grained levels of detail. Starting with a high-level question, we prompt the model to break it down into sub-questions, estimate uncertainty for each, and then recursively apply this process to sub-questions. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to consider different aspects of uncertainty at each level, such as factual knowledge, logical reasoning, and contextual understanding. We aggregate these multi-scale uncertainty estimates using a novel fractal dimension-inspired metric, providing a more comprehensive view of the model's confidence across different levels of abstraction.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover a range of reasoning tasks: (1) TruthfulQA for factual recall and logical reasoning, (2) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving, and (3) MMLU for multi-task language understanding. These datasets provide a diverse set of questions that require different levels of reasoning and knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty quantification methods: (1) Direct probability estimation, where we simply ask the model to output a confidence score, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (3) Ensemble of models. For each baseline, we'll use the same prompts across all datasets.",
            "Step 3: Fractal Uncertainty Prompting Implementation": "Implement our FUP method with the following steps: (a) Initial question decomposition, (b) Recursive sub-question generation, (c) Uncertainty estimation for each sub-question, (d) Aggregation of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models provide state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and FUP), we will run the uncertainty quantification process on all questions. We'll use a maximum of 3 levels of recursion for FUP to balance depth and computational cost.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Calibration error, (2) Brier score, (3) Our novel 'fractal uncertainty consistency' metric, which measures the coherence of uncertainty estimates across scales.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: (a) Comparison of FUP against baselines, (b) Performance across different types of questions and reasoning tasks, (c) Analysis of the fractal structure of uncertainty estimates, (d) Qualitative analysis of generated sub-questions and uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score without breaking down the reasoning process."
            },
            "FUP Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Break this question down into sub-questions, estimate your confidence for each, and then provide an overall answer and confidence score.",
                "Output": "Sub-questions:\n1. What is the definition of a capital city? (Confidence: 0.99)\n2. Which city serves as the seat of government for France? (Confidence: 0.97)\n3. Is Paris commonly recognized as the capital of France? (Confidence: 0.99)\n4. Are there any historical factors that confirm Paris as the capital? (Confidence: 0.95)\n\nOverall answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nOverall confidence score: 0.97\n\nExplanation: The overall confidence is derived from the fractal structure of sub-question confidences, providing a more nuanced understanding of the model's certainty.",
                "Explanation": "FUP breaks down the question into sub-components, allowing for a more detailed assessment of uncertainty at different levels of the reasoning process."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed FUP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we will pivot to an analysis paper focusing on the structure of uncertainty in language models. We'll investigate why the fractal approach didn't yield the expected improvements, potentially revealing insights about the nature of uncertainty in these models. We can analyze the generated sub-questions to understand how models decompose complex queries, and examine the patterns in confidence scores across different levels of abstraction. Additionally, we'll conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of different components of our method, such as the recursion depth or the aggregation technique. This analysis could inform future approaches to uncertainty quantification in language models and provide valuable insights into the limitations of current models in assessing their own confidence."
