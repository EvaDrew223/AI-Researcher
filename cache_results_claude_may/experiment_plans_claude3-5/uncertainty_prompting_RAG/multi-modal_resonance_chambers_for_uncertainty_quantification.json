        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with multi-modal information or when different modalities provide conflicting signals.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods focus on text-only uncertainty estimation and do not fully leverage multi-modal information.",
        "Motivation": "By creating 'resonance chambers' that bounce information between different modalities, we can probe the consistency of an LLM's knowledge across modalities and use this to refine uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Modal Resonance Prompting (MMRP), which creates a series of prompts that cycle information through different modalities (text, image, audio, etc.). For example, given a text query, MMRP might prompt the LLM to generate an image description, then use this description to generate an actual image, then prompt for a textual description of this image, and so on. At each step, the LLM is asked to provide confidence estimates. The 'resonance' of information across these modal transitions is analyzed to quantify uncertainty. Prompts are designed to encourage explicit reasoning about how information changes or degrades across modalities. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the stability and consistency of information across these multi-modal cycles.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test MMRP on a multi-modal dataset, comparing it with both unimodal and simple multi-modal uncertainty estimation methods. Evaluate using calibration metrics and novel measures of cross-modal consistency."

        "Title": "Multi-Modal Resonance Prompting for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with multi-modal information or when different modalities provide conflicting signals. This issue is particularly pronounced in complex reasoning tasks that involve multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio. Existing methods primarily focus on text-only uncertainty estimation and do not fully leverage multi-modal information, leading to potentially unreliable or inconsistent uncertainty estimates in real-world applications where multiple data types are involved.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs are limited by their focus on single-modality (usually text) inputs. However, real-world scenarios often involve multiple data types, and the interplay between these modalities can significantly impact the model's confidence and accuracy. By creating 'resonance chambers' that bounce information between different modalities, we can probe the consistency of an LLM's knowledge across modalities and use this to refine uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often cross-reference information across different sensory inputs to gauge our confidence in a particular belief or decision. Multi-Modal Resonance Prompting (MMRP) aims to mimic this process, potentially leading to more robust and reliable uncertainty estimates in complex, multi-modal scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Modal Resonance Prompting (MMRP), which creates a series of prompts that cycle information through different modalities (text, image, audio, etc.). The method consists of the following steps:\n1. Initial Query: Start with a text query and generate an initial response with a confidence estimate.\n2. Modal Transition: Prompt the LLM to generate a description for another modality (e.g., image description) based on the initial response.\n3. Cross-Modal Verification: Use this description to generate actual content in the new modality (e.g., generate an image using an image generation model).\n4. Resonance Check: Prompt the LLM to describe the generated content back in the original modality (text).\n5. Consistency Analysis: Compare the original response with the result of the resonance check, asking the LLM to provide a confidence estimate based on the consistency between the two.\n6. Iteration: Repeat steps 2-5 for multiple modality cycles (e.g., text-image-text, text-audio-text).\n7. Final Uncertainty Estimation: Aggregate the confidence estimates from each cycle to produce a final uncertainty quantification.\nPrompts are designed to encourage explicit reasoning about how information changes or degrades across modalities. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the stability and consistency of information across these multi-modal cycles.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the MS-COCO dataset, which provides image-caption pairs, as our primary dataset. We will select a subset of 1000 image-caption pairs for our experiments. Additionally, we will use the AudioCaps dataset for audio-related tasks, selecting 500 audio-caption pairs.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary LLM for text processing and uncertainty estimation. For image generation, we will use DALL-E 2. For audio generation, we will use Bark text-to-speech model.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\n1. Direct Text-based Uncertainty: Prompt GPT-4 with the caption and ask for a confidence estimate.\n2. Simple Multi-modal Uncertainty: Show GPT-4 both the caption and the image, then ask for a confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: MMRP Implementation": "Implement the MMRP method as follows:\na) Initial Query: Use the caption as the initial query.\nb) Modal Transition: Prompt GPT-4 to generate an image description based on the caption.\nc) Cross-Modal Verification: Use DALL-E 2 to generate an image based on this description.\nd) Resonance Check: Show GPT-4 the generated image and ask it to describe it.\ne) Consistency Analysis: Compare the original caption with the new description, asking GPT-4 for a confidence estimate.\nf) Iteration: Repeat the process for text-audio-text cycle using Bark for audio generation.\ng) Final Uncertainty Estimation: Aggregate confidence estimates from all cycles.",
            "Step 5: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the MMRP process. Example prompts:\n- Modal Transition: \"Based on the following caption, generate a detailed image description: [CAPTION]\"\n- Resonance Check: \"Describe the image you see in detail.\"\n- Consistency Analysis: \"Compare the following two descriptions and rate their consistency on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is perfectly consistent: [ORIGINAL] vs [NEW]\"\n- Final Estimation: \"Based on the consistency scores from different modality cycles, provide an overall confidence estimate for the original caption.\"",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics:\n1. Calibration Error: Compare the model's confidence estimates with its actual accuracy.\n2. Brier Score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n3. Cross-modal Consistency Score: A new metric measuring the average consistency between original and resonance-checked descriptions.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run the baseline methods and MMRP on the prepared dataset. For each image-caption pair:\n1. Get uncertainty estimates from both baseline methods.\n2. Run the full MMRP cycle (text-image-text and text-audio-text).\n3. Record all intermediate outputs and final uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "1. Compare the calibration error and Brier scores of MMRP against the baselines.\n2. Analyze how uncertainty estimates change across modality transitions.\n3. Investigate correlations between cross-modal consistency and final uncertainty estimates.\n4. Identify cases where MMRP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Text-based Uncertainty)": "Caption: A group of people standing next to an elephant. Estimate your confidence in the accuracy of this caption on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is absolutely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Text-based Uncertainty)": "Confidence: 85. The caption describes a common scene that could be accurately captured in an image. However, without seeing the actual image, there's always some uncertainty about the specific details or potential additional elements not mentioned in the caption.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Multi-modal Uncertainty)": "[IMAGE] Caption: A group of people standing next to an elephant. Based on both the image and the caption, estimate your confidence in the accuracy of this caption on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is absolutely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Multi-modal Uncertainty)": "Confidence: 95. The image clearly shows a group of people standing next to an elephant, which perfectly matches the caption. The high confidence is due to the direct visual confirmation of the caption's content.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MMRP; Step 1: Initial Query)": "Caption: A group of people standing next to an elephant. Provide an initial confidence estimate for this caption on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MMRP; Step 1: Initial Query)": "Initial Confidence: 80. The caption describes a plausible scene, but without additional context or verification, there's some inherent uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MMRP; Step 2: Modal Transition)": "Based on the following caption, generate a detailed image description: A group of people standing next to an elephant.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MMRP; Step 2: Modal Transition)": "Image Description: The image shows a small group of about 4-5 people standing in close proximity to a large African elephant. The elephant is on the right side of the frame, its gray, wrinkled skin and long tusks clearly visible. The people, a mix of adults, are wearing casual clothing suitable for a safari or zoo visit. They are facing the elephant, some with expressions of awe or excitement. The background suggests an outdoor setting, possibly a wildlife reserve or a zoo enclosure, with some trees or foliage visible.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MMRP; Step 3: Cross-Modal Verification)": "[Use DALL-E 2 to generate an image based on the description from Step 2]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MMRP; Step 4: Resonance Check)": "Describe the image you see in detail.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MMRP; Step 4: Resonance Check)": "The image shows a group of four people standing near a large African elephant. The elephant is on the right side of the image, its gray skin and tusks clearly visible. The people, two men and two women, are wearing casual clothing like t-shirts and shorts. They appear to be tourists or visitors, looking at the elephant with interest. The setting seems to be outdoors, possibly in a wildlife park or safari, with some trees and grassland in the background.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MMRP; Step 5: Consistency Analysis)": "Compare the following two descriptions and rate their consistency on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is perfectly consistent:\nOriginal: A group of people standing next to an elephant.\nNew: The image shows a group of four people standing near a large African elephant. The elephant is on the right side of the image, its gray skin and tusks clearly visible. The people, two men and two women, are wearing casual clothing like t-shirts and shorts. They appear to be tourists or visitors, looking at the elephant with interest. The setting seems to be outdoors, possibly in a wildlife park or safari, with some trees and grassland in the background.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MMRP; Step 5: Consistency Analysis)": "Consistency Score: 95. The two descriptions are highly consistent with each other. The original caption provides a concise summary of the main elements: people and an elephant. The new description elaborates on these elements, providing more details about the number of people, their appearance, the elephant's features, and the setting. All of these details are consistent with and expand upon the original caption without contradicting it.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MMRP; Final Estimation)": "Based on the initial confidence of 80 and the consistency score of 95 from the image cycle, provide an overall confidence estimate for the original caption: A group of people standing next to an elephant.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MMRP; Final Estimation)": "Final Confidence Estimate: 92. The high consistency between the original caption and the description generated from the image cycle significantly increases our confidence in the accuracy of the caption. The initial estimate of 80 was conservative due to lack of visual confirmation, but the strong agreement in the image cycle (95 consistency) suggests that the caption is indeed accurate. The slight reduction from 95 to 92 accounts for any potential discrepancies in minor details not captured in the brief original caption.",
            "explanation": "MMRP improves upon the baselines by leveraging multi-modal information cycles. The direct text-based method provides a lower confidence due to lack of visual information. The simple multi-modal method gives high confidence but doesn't account for potential discrepancies across modalities. MMRP, through its resonance cycle, provides a more nuanced and potentially more reliable confidence estimate by considering how well the information translates across modalities."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MMRP method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why MMRP fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of cross-modal information transfer in LLMs. This could involve categorizing different types of inconsistencies that arise during modal transitions and analyzing their impact on uncertainty estimation. Second, we could explore variations of the MMRP method, such as weighted aggregation of confidence scores from different modality cycles, or incorporating more diverse modalities (e.g., tactile descriptions, emotional responses). Third, we could investigate how MMRP performs on different types of tasks beyond image-caption matching, such as fact-checking or abstract reasoning problems, which might reveal task-specific strengths or weaknesses of the method. Lastly, we could compare MMRP with other advanced uncertainty quantification methods like ensemble techniques or Bayesian neural networks, positioning our work as a comparative study of different approaches to uncertainty estimation in multi-modal contexts."
