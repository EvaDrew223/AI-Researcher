    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their outputs, even when generating incorrect or nonsensical information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting or chain-of-thought reasoning do not explicitly address confidence calibration.",
        "Motivation": "Diluting the model's knowledge gradually could reveal the point at which uncertainty emerges, providing a calibrated confidence estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Prompt Dilution (CCPD), a novel prompting technique that systematically dilutes the input prompt to gauge model uncertainty. CCPD starts with a fully detailed prompt and progressively removes information, creating a series of increasingly vague prompts. The model generates responses and confidence estimates for each diluted prompt. By analyzing how the model's outputs and reported confidence change as information is removed, we can pinpoint the threshold at which genuine uncertainty emerges. This allows us to calibrate the model's confidence on the original, undiluted prompt. The dilution process involves techniques like replacing specific terms with more general categories, removing context, and introducing ambiguity.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CCPD against standard prompting and existing calibration methods on tasks like question-answering and fact verification. Evaluate using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score."

        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Prompt Dilution: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their outputs, even when generating incorrect or nonsensical information. This overconfidence can lead to misplaced trust in model outputs and potentially harmful decision-making based on unreliable information.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting or chain-of-thought reasoning do not explicitly address confidence calibration. By systematically diluting the input prompt, we can reveal the point at which uncertainty emerges, providing a calibrated confidence estimate. This method leverages the model's own knowledge and reasoning capabilities without requiring additional training or external resources.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Prompt Dilution (CCPD), a novel prompting technique that systematically dilutes the input prompt to gauge model uncertainty. CCPD starts with a fully detailed prompt and progressively removes information, creating a series of increasingly vague prompts.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets for question-answering and fact verification tasks. We will use the TruthfulQA dataset for question-answering and the FEVER dataset for fact verification.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and existing calibration methods (e.g., temperature scaling) as baselines.",
            "Step 3: CCPD Implementation": "Develop the CCPD algorithm, including prompt dilution techniques and confidence estimation.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Create a set of initial prompts for each task, ensuring they contain sufficient detail for systematic dilution.",
            "Step 5: Dilution Process": "Implement the prompt dilution process, creating a series of increasingly vague prompts for each initial prompt.",
            "Step 6: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 7: Generate Responses": "For each dilution level, generate model responses and confidence estimates using the selected models.",
            "Step 8: Confidence Calibration": "Analyze the response patterns and confidence estimates across dilution levels to determine the uncertainty threshold and calibrate the final confidence score.",
            "Step 9: Evaluation": "Compare CCPD against baselines using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score.",
            "Step 10: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of results, including the effectiveness of different dilution techniques and the relationship between prompt specificity and model confidence."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. (Confidence: 95%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCPD; Step 1: Full Prompt)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCPD; Step 1: Full Prompt)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969. (Confidence: 98%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCPD; Step 2: Diluted Prompt 1)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon during a space mission in the 1960s?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCPD; Step 2: Diluted Prompt 1)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon during a space mission in the 1960s. (Confidence: 95%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCPD; Step 3: Diluted Prompt 2)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCPD; Step 3: Diluted Prompt 2)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. (Confidence: 90%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCPD; Step 4: Diluted Prompt 3)": "Q: Who was involved in a significant space achievement?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCPD; Step 4: Diluted Prompt 3)": "A: Neil Armstrong was involved in a significant space achievement by being the first person to walk on the moon. (Confidence: 85%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCPD; Final Calibrated Output)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCPD; Final Calibrated Output)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969. (Calibrated Confidence: 90%)",
            "Explanation": "CCPD demonstrates how confidence changes as the prompt is diluted, allowing for a more calibrated final confidence estimate. The baseline method may overestimate confidence, while CCPD provides a more nuanced assessment based on the model's performance across different levels of information specificity."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCPD does not significantly improve confidence calibration, we can explore alternative approaches. One option is to analyze the patterns of confidence changes across dilution levels to gain insights into the model's uncertainty estimation process. We could also investigate the impact of different dilution techniques on model performance and confidence estimation. Additionally, we might consider combining CCPD with other calibration methods, such as ensemble techniques or post-hoc calibration, to create a hybrid approach. Another avenue for exploration could be to use the dilution process to generate a dataset of varying difficulty levels, which could be used to train a separate calibration model. Finally, we could shift the focus to analyzing how different types of information (e.g., temporal, spatial, or contextual details) affect model confidence, potentially leading to insights about the model's reasoning processes and knowledge representation."
