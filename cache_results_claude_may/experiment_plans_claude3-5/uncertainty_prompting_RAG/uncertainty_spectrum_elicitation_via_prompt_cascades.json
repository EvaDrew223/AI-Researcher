        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often rely on single-step prompting, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty across different levels of abstraction and reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches include using calibrated softmax probabilities, ensemble methods, and simple confidence elicitation prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the human cognitive process of progressively refining understanding and confidence through multiple levels of analysis, we propose a method that systematically probes the model's uncertainty across various abstraction levels and reasoning steps.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Elicitation via Prompt Cascades (USE-PC), a multi-step prompting technique that constructs a cascade of increasingly specific prompts. Starting with a high-level query, each subsequent prompt delves deeper into specific aspects of the problem, creating a tree-like structure of nested queries. At each level, the model is asked to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The confidence estimates are then aggregated using a novel weighted scheme that accounts for the hierarchical nature of the prompts. This method allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the model's uncertainty across different facets of the problem.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate USE-PC against baseline methods such as direct confidence elicitation and calibrated softmax probabilities on a range of tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and multi-step problem-solving. We will use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score to assess calibration, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) to evaluate uncertainty discrimination."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Spectrum Elicitation via Prompt Cascades (USE-PC): A Multi-Level Approach to Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often rely on single-step prompting, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty across different levels of abstraction and reasoning. This limitation can lead to overconfident or poorly calibrated predictions, potentially resulting in unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches such as calibrated softmax probabilities, ensemble methods, and simple confidence elicitation prompts provide limited insight into the nuanced nature of model uncertainty. Inspired by the human cognitive process of progressively refining understanding and confidence through multiple levels of analysis, we propose a method that systematically probes the model's uncertainty across various abstraction levels and reasoning steps. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of model uncertainty, potentially leading to better-calibrated and more reliable language model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Elicitation via Prompt Cascades (USE-PC), a multi-step prompting technique that constructs a cascade of increasingly specific prompts. Starting with a high-level query, each subsequent prompt delves deeper into specific aspects of the problem, creating a tree-like structure of nested queries. At each level, the model is asked to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The confidence estimates are then aggregated using a novel weighted scheme that accounts for the hierarchical nature of the prompts. This method allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the model's uncertainty across different facets of the problem.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover a range of task types: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) GSM8K for multi-step mathematical problem-solving. These datasets will help evaluate the method's effectiveness across different domains and reasoning complexities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. (2) Calibrated softmax probabilities: use the max softmax probability as a confidence score. (3) Monte Carlo Dropout: perform 30 forward passes with dropout enabled and use the variance of the outputs as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: USE-PC Implementation": "For each question in the datasets: (1) Generate a cascade of prompts, starting with the original question and progressively asking for more specific details or intermediate reasoning steps. (2) For each prompt in the cascade, ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence estimate. (3) Implement the hierarchical confidence aggregation method, which weights confidence scores based on their level in the prompt cascade.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (1) Run the baseline methods and record their predictions and confidence scores. (2) Run the USE-PC method, recording the cascade of answers and confidence scores, as well as the final aggregated confidence score. (3) Ensure all experiments are run with the same computational resources and API settings for fair comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess overall calibration. (2) Brier Score to measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (3) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) to evaluate uncertainty discrimination. (4) Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between confidence scores and correctness of answers.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: (1) Compare USE-PC against baselines across all metrics and datasets. (2) Analyze how the depth of the prompt cascade affects uncertainty quantification. (3) Investigate cases where USE-PC significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. (4) Examine the relationship between task complexity and the effectiveness of USE-PC."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USE-PC; Level 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USE-PC; Level 1)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USE-PC; Level 2)": "Q: You said the capital of France is Paris. Can you name three important landmarks in this city? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100) for each landmark.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USE-PC; Level 2)": "A: 1. Eiffel Tower (Confidence: 100)\n2. Louvre Museum (Confidence: 98)\n3. Notre-Dame Cathedral (Confidence: 95)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USE-PC; Level 3)": "Q: For the Eiffel Tower, can you state the year it was completed? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USE-PC; Level 3)": "A: The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889. Confidence: 90",
            "explanation": "USE-PC provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence across different levels of knowledge. While the model is highly confident about Paris being the capital, its confidence decreases slightly when asked about specific landmarks and historical details. This cascade of prompts allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the model's uncertainty, potentially revealing areas where the model is less certain but wouldn't have been captured by a single confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If USE-PC does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: (1) Examining the structure of our prompt cascades to ensure they effectively probe different levels of knowledge and reasoning. (2) Analyzing the relationship between cascade depth and performance to determine if there's an optimal depth for different task types. (3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from USE-PC than others. (4) Exploring alternative aggregation methods for combining confidence scores across the cascade. Additionally, we could pivot to focus on developing a new metric for evaluating the quality of uncertainty estimates that takes into account the multi-level nature of knowledge and reasoning. This could lead to insights about the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty quantification methods and potentially inform the development of new, more effective approaches."
