        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overly simplistic uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the nuanced, multidimensional nature of their knowledge and confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically produce scalar confidence scores or simple categorical uncertainty estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of tessellation in mathematics and art, where complex patterns emerge from simple repeated shapes, we propose a method to construct a rich, multidimensional map of model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Tessellation for Uncertainty Mapping (STUM), a prompting technique that decomposes a given query into a 'tessellation' of related sub-queries that cover different aspects or dimensions of the original question. For example, given a history question, STUM might generate sub-queries about geographical context, temporal sequence, key figures, and causal relationships. The model is then prompted to answer each sub-query and provide a confidence estimate. These responses form a tessellated pattern of uncertainty, where each 'tile' represents a different facet of the model's knowledge. The overall uncertainty is then derived from this pattern, considering factors such as the variance in confidence across tiles, the presence of contradictions between adjacent tiles, and the overall coherence of the tessellation. This approach provides a much richer representation of uncertainty that can capture nuanced patterns of knowledge and gaps.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate STUM against scalar and categorical uncertainty estimation methods on diverse datasets covering multiple domains (e.g., NaturalQuestions, SciQ, HistoryQA). Develop novel evaluation metrics to assess the informativeness and utility of the multidimensional uncertainty representations. Conduct user studies to determine if STUM's uncertainty maps provide more actionable insights for human-AI collaboration tasks."

        "Title": "Semantic Tessellation for Uncertainty Mapping: A Multidimensional Approach to Quantifying LLM Confidence",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overly simplistic uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the nuanced, multidimensional nature of their knowledge and confidence. This limitation hinders the effective use of LLMs in critical applications where understanding the model's uncertainty is crucial for decision-making and trust.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods typically produce scalar confidence scores or simple categorical uncertainty estimates, which are insufficient for capturing the complex nature of LLM knowledge. Inspired by the concept of tessellation in mathematics and art, where complex patterns emerge from simple repeated shapes, we propose a method to construct a rich, multidimensional map of model uncertainty. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and actionable representation of LLM uncertainty, enabling better-informed decision-making in AI-assisted tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Tessellation for Uncertainty Mapping (STUM), a prompting technique that decomposes a given query into a 'tessellation' of related sub-queries covering different aspects or dimensions of the original question. The LLM is then prompted to answer each sub-query and provide a confidence estimate.

The overall uncertainty is derived from this pattern, considering factors such as the variance in confidence across tiles, the presence of contradictions between adjacent tiles, and the overall coherence of the tessellation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering multiple domains: NaturalQuestions for general knowledge, SciQ for scientific knowledge, and HistoryQA for historical knowledge. From each dataset, randomly sample 1000 questions for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence estimation: prompt the LLM to provide a single confidence score for each question. (2) Categorical uncertainty estimation: prompt the LLM to classify its uncertainty into predefined categories (e.g., 'Very Certain', 'Somewhat Certain', 'Uncertain').",
            "Step 3: STUM Implementation": "Develop the STUM prompting technique: (a) Create a prompt template for generating sub-queries. (b) Implement a function to generate the tessellation of sub-queries for each main question. (c) Design a prompt template for answering sub-queries with confidence estimates. (d) Develop an algorithm to aggregate the sub-query responses into a multidimensional uncertainty representation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for evaluation. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-v1.3 for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Develop novel evaluation metrics: (a) Uncertainty Dimensionality Score: measure the number of distinct uncertainty dimensions captured. (b) Tessellation Coherence Score: assess the logical consistency between adjacent tiles. (c) Uncertainty-Performance Correlation: calculate the correlation between the multidimensional uncertainty estimates and actual performance.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Run baseline methods on all questions. (b) Apply STUM to generate tessellated uncertainty maps for all questions. (c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and STUM.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation with 50 randomly selected questions. Ask human evaluators to rate the informativeness and actionability of the uncertainty representations produced by baselines and STUM.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare STUM against baselines across all metrics and datasets. Analyze patterns in the tessellated uncertainty maps, identifying common uncertainty dimensions across different question types.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the number of sub-queries and the aggregation method to understand their impact on the performance of STUM."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nProvide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\nConfidence score: 0.98",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score, which doesn't capture the nuanced nature of the model's knowledge about France, its geography, or potential historical changes in capitals."
            },
            "STUM Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nGenerate 5 sub-queries that explore different aspects of this question, then answer each sub-query with a confidence score.",
                "Output": "Sub-queries and answers:\n1. Q: What is the current official capital of France?\nA: Paris (Confidence: 0.99)\n2. Q: Has the capital of France changed throughout history?\nA: Yes, it has changed a few times, with Paris becoming the consistent capital since 987 CE. (Confidence: 0.85)\n3. Q: Are there any other major cities in France that serve important governmental functions?\nA: While Paris is the primary capital, some institutions are located elsewhere, like the European Parliament sessions in Strasbourg. (Confidence: 0.80)\n4. Q: What is the population of France's capital?\nA: The population of Paris proper is around 2.2 million, while the greater Paris area has about 12 million inhabitants. (Confidence: 0.90)\n5. Q: In what region of France is the capital located?\nA: Paris is located in the \u00cele-de-France region in north-central France. (Confidence: 0.95)\n\nOverall uncertainty representation: [0.99, 0.85, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95]",
                "Explanation": "STUM provides a multidimensional uncertainty representation that captures various aspects of the model's knowledge about France's capital, including historical context, governmental functions, demographics, and geography. This tessellated approach offers a more comprehensive view of the model's confidence across different facets of the question."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If STUM doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of LLM uncertainty patterns. We'll examine the generated sub-queries and their answers to identify common themes in uncertainty across different question types and domains. This analysis could reveal insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs' knowledge representation. Additionally, we can explore alternative aggregation methods for the tessellated uncertainty maps, such as graph-based representations or clustering techniques, to better capture the relationships between different uncertainty dimensions. Finally, we could investigate how the tessellated uncertainty maps correlate with actual model performance, potentially leading to the development of a new metric for predicting LLM reliability in different domains."
