    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple viewpoints or interpretations are possible.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on single-perspective confidence estimates or limited forms of self-consistency checking, which may not capture the full range of potential uncertainties.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the adversarial process in legal systems and scientific peer review, we propose that a model engaging in structured self-debate can better uncover and quantify its own uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Self-Debate for Uncertainty Quantification (ASDUQ), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model through a structured debate with itself. The process involves: 1) Initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Generation of multiple adversarial perspectives challenging the initial response. 3) Rebuttals to each adversarial perspective. 4) A judicial summary weighing the arguments and counter-arguments. 5) Final confidence re-estimation based on the debate. Each step is prompted separately, with the model instructed to adopt different personas (e.g., prosecutor, defender, judge) to encourage diverse viewpoints. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the strength and diversity of the adversarial arguments, the quality of rebuttals, and the model's ability to reconcile conflicting viewpoints in the judicial summary.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ASDUQ against standard uncertainty estimation methods on complex reasoning tasks, including ethical dilemmas, scientific hypotheses evaluation, and legal case analysis. Metrics will include calibration error, a novel 'debate strength' score, and human expert evaluations of the debate quality and final uncertainty estimates. We will also analyze the diversity and coherence of the generated adversarial perspectives to assess the method's robustness."

        "Title": "Adversarial Self-Debate for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple viewpoints or interpretations are possible. This inability to accurately assess confidence can lead to overconfident errors or underutilization of model capabilities.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches often rely on single-perspective confidence estimates or limited forms of self-consistency checking, which may not capture the full range of potential uncertainties. Inspired by the adversarial process in legal systems and scientific peer review, we propose that a model engaging in structured self-debate can better uncover and quantify its own uncertainties. This method leverages the model's ability to generate diverse perspectives and critically evaluate arguments, potentially leading to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve complex reasoning and potential for multiple valid interpretations: 1) Ethical dilemmas from the ETHICS dataset, 2) Scientific hypotheses evaluation from the ScienceQA dataset, and 3) Legal case analysis from the LexGLUE dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation, and 3) Self-consistency method (generating multiple CoT samples and aggregating).",
            "Step 3: ASDUQ Implementation": "Implement the ASDUQ method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response generation, b) Adversarial perspective generation, c) Rebuttal generation, d) Judicial summary generation, e) Final confidence estimation.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of ASDUQ. For example: a) Initial response: 'Please provide an answer to the following question and estimate your confidence on a scale of 0-100%: [QUESTION]' b) Adversarial perspectives: 'You are now a critical thinker. Generate three distinct arguments that challenge the following answer: [INITIAL_ANSWER]' c) Rebuttals: 'You are now defending the original answer. Provide a rebuttal for each of the following criticisms: [CRITICISMS]' d) Judicial summary: 'As an impartial judge, summarize the key points of the debate and weigh the strength of arguments on both sides: [DEBATE_TRANSCRIPT]' e) Final confidence: 'Based on the entire debate, re-estimate your confidence in the original answer on a scale of 0-100%, and explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model, with GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude 2 as comparison models to test the generalizability of the method.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence estimates with its actual accuracy. b) Debate strength score: Develop a rubric to assess the quality and diversity of arguments in the debate. c) Human evaluation: Recruit domain experts to rate the quality of the debates and the appropriateness of the final confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. b) Run the ASDUQ method and collect results. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for all methods.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare ASDUQ against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze the diversity and coherence of generated adversarial perspectives. c) Investigate how the debate process influences the final confidence estimates. d) Examine cases where ASDUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: A new drug shows promise in treating a rare genetic disorder, but it has severe side effects in 10% of patients. Should it be approved for use? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Yes, the drug should be approved for use. For patients with a rare genetic disorder, this new drug could be their only hope for treatment. While the severe side effects in 10% of patients are concerning, for the other 90%, this drug could significantly improve their quality of life or even be life-saving. The benefits outweigh the risks, especially considering the rarity of the disorder and the likely lack of alternative treatments. However, it's crucial that patients are fully informed of the potential side effects before starting treatment. Confidence: 80%",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: A new drug shows promise in treating a rare genetic disorder, but it has severe side effects in 10% of patients. Should it be approved for use? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: Yes, the drug should be approved for use. For patients with a rare genetic disorder, this new drug could be their only hope for treatment. While the severe side effects in 10% of patients are concerning, for the other 90%, this drug could significantly improve their quality of life or even be life-saving. The benefits outweigh the risks, especially considering the rarity of the disorder and the likely lack of alternative treatments. However, it's crucial that patients are fully informed of the potential side effects before starting treatment. Confidence: 80%",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Input (Step 2: Adversarial Perspectives)": "You are now a critical thinker. Generate three distinct arguments that challenge the following answer: [INITIAL_ANSWER]",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Adversarial Perspectives)": "1. Patient Safety: Approving a drug with severe side effects in 10% of patients is ethically questionable. This means that for every 10 patients treated, one could suffer significantly. In medicine, the principle of 'first, do no harm' is paramount, and this drug violates that principle for a substantial portion of patients.\n2. Economic and Legal Implications: Approving this drug could lead to significant legal and economic consequences. Lawsuits from patients who experience severe side effects could be costly for the healthcare system and the drug manufacturer. This could potentially make the drug too expensive or lead to its withdrawal, ultimately harming patients who could have benefited.\n3. Alternative Research Paths: Approving this drug might divert resources and attention from developing safer alternatives. If the drug is approved, there may be less incentive to continue research into treatments with fewer side effects. This could result in a suboptimal long-term outcome for patients with this rare genetic disorder.",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Input (Step 3: Rebuttals)": "You are now defending the original answer. Provide a rebuttal for each of the following criticisms: [CRITICISMS]",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Rebuttals)": "1. Rebuttal to Patient Safety: While patient safety is indeed crucial, we must consider the context of a rare genetic disorder. For many patients, the alternative to this drug might be continued suffering or even death. A 10% risk of severe side effects, while significant, may be an acceptable risk for patients who have no other options. Moreover, with proper monitoring and management, some of these side effects might be mitigated or managed effectively.\n2. Rebuttal to Economic and Legal Implications: The potential for lawsuits exists with any new drug, especially those for serious conditions. However, this risk can be mitigated through thorough informed consent processes and clear communication about the potential side effects. The economic argument also fails to consider the potential cost savings from effectively treating a previously untreatable condition, which could offset legal and healthcare costs.\n3. Rebuttal to Alternative Research Paths: Approving this drug does not necessarily mean halting research into safer alternatives. In fact, it could provide valuable real-world data that informs future research. Additionally, having an approved treatment could make it easier to recruit patients for clinical trials of new drugs, as there would be an established standard of care to compare against.",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Input (Step 4: Judicial Summary)": "As an impartial judge, summarize the key points of the debate and weigh the strength of arguments on both sides: [DEBATE_TRANSCRIPT]",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Judicial Summary)": "This debate centers on whether to approve a promising new drug for a rare genetic disorder that has severe side effects in 10% of patients. The initial argument for approval emphasizes the potential benefits for the majority of patients and the lack of alternatives for a rare condition. The counterarguments raise important concerns about patient safety, potential legal and economic consequences, and the impact on future research.\nBoth sides present valid points. The argument for approval is strong, considering the drug's potential to significantly improve or save lives in a condition with limited treatment options. The principle of patient autonomy also supports making the drug available to those who understand and accept the risks.\nHowever, the counterarguments raise crucial ethical and practical concerns. The 10% rate of severe side effects is not trivial, and there are valid concerns about long-term consequences of approval, both for individual patients and for the broader landscape of drug development for this condition.\nOn balance, the argument for approval seems slightly stronger, but with important caveats. The decision to approve should be accompanied by stringent requirements for patient education, informed consent, and post-market surveillance. Additionally, approval should be conditional, with requirements for ongoing research into mitigating side effects and developing safer alternatives.",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Input (Step 5: Final Confidence Estimation)": "Based on the entire debate, re-estimate your confidence in the original answer on a scale of 0-100%, and explain your reasoning.",
            "ASDUQ Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Final Confidence Estimation)": "Revised confidence: 65%\nReasoning: The debate has highlighted significant complexities and valid concerns on both sides of the argument. While I still lean towards approving the drug, my confidence has decreased from the initial 80% to 65%. The strong counterarguments, particularly regarding patient safety and potential long-term implications, have tempered my initial certainty. The debate has underscored the need for a nuanced approach, potentially involving conditional approval with stringent safeguards and ongoing research requirements. This reduced confidence reflects the genuine difficulty of balancing potential benefits against known risks in the context of a rare disease with limited treatment options.",
            "Explanation": "The ASDUQ method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the problem compared to the baseline method. By generating adversarial perspectives, rebuttals, and a judicial summary, it explores multiple facets of the issue that weren't initially considered. This process leads to a more calibrated final confidence estimate, reflecting a deeper understanding of the complexities and uncertainties involved in the decision."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the ASDUQ method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines in terms of calibration error or human evaluation scores, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of the generated debates, focusing on the types of arguments and counterarguments produced, to gain insights into the model's reasoning processes and potential biases. This could lead to a paper on the strengths and limitations of LLMs in multi-perspective reasoning. Second, we could investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from the ASDUQ approach, potentially uncovering specific use cases where this method is most effective. Third, we could explore variations of the ASDUQ method, such as increasing the number of debate rounds, introducing external knowledge sources, or experimenting with different prompting strategies for each step. These variations could help identify the most crucial components of the method and lead to improved performance. Lastly, if the method consistently fails to improve uncertainty quantification, we could shift focus to analyzing why this is the case, potentially uncovering fundamental limitations in how LLMs represent and reason about uncertainty. This could contribute valuable insights to the ongoing research on LLM capabilities and limitations."
