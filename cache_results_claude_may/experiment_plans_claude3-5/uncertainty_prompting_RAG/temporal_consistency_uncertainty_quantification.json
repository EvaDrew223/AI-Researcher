    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide inconsistent answers to the same or similar questions over time, but struggle to recognize and quantify this inconsistency as a form of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty based on a single interaction, missing the potential for temporal inconsistencies.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of test-retest reliability in psychology, we propose leveraging multiple interactions over time to better quantify LLM uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Uncertainty Quantification (TCUQ), a prompting strategy that assesses model confidence through repeated interactions. TCUQ begins by storing an initial query and response. After a 'cooldown' period (simulated by processing unrelated queries), TCUQ re-presents the original query, along with semantically similar variations. The model is then prompted to compare its new responses with the stored original, analyzing any differences. For example, 'Compare your current answer to your previous response. Identify any inconsistencies and explain possible reasons for them.' This process is repeated several times, with prompts encouraging the model to reflect on its consistency over time. TCUQ derives a final confidence score based on the stability of answers across temporal iterations and the model's own analysis of its consistency. This approach captures uncertainty stemming from the model's internal state fluctuations and sensitivity to context.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TCUQ against single-interaction confidence estimation techniques on various tasks, including factual recall, reasoning problems, and open-ended generation. Key metrics will include temporal calibration error (how well confidence scores predict consistency over time), ability to identify queries with high temporal variance, and correlation between TCUQ scores and human judgments of answer reliability."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Uncertainty Quantification: Leveraging Multiple Interactions to Calibrate LLM Confidence",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inconsistent answers to the same or similar questions over time, but struggle to recognize and quantify this inconsistency as a form of uncertainty. Current approaches typically assess uncertainty based on a single interaction, missing the potential for temporal inconsistencies. This project aims to develop a novel prompting method that can better quantify uncertainty and calibrate the confidence of LLMs by leveraging multiple interactions over time.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-interaction assessments, which fail to capture the temporal inconsistencies that can arise when models are queried multiple times. Inspired by the concept of test-retest reliability in psychology, we propose leveraging multiple interactions over time to better quantify LLM uncertainty. This approach has the potential to provide a more comprehensive and accurate measure of model confidence, as it accounts for the model's internal state fluctuations and sensitivity to context across multiple interactions.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare datasets for three task categories: (1) Factual recall: Use a subset of TriviaQA or Natural Questions. (2) Reasoning problems: Use a subset of GSM8K for math reasoning. (3) Open-ended generation: Create a custom dataset of open-ended prompts (e.g., 'Describe the future of AI'). For each dataset, create semantically similar variations of each question using paraphrasing techniques.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Optionally, include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. (2) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Generate multiple responses (e.g., 5) to the same query and calculate the variance or entropy of the responses.",
            "Step 4: TCUQ Implementation": "Implement the TCUQ method with the following steps: (a) Store the initial query and response. (b) Simulate a cooldown period by processing 3-5 unrelated queries. (c) Re-present the original query and 2-3 semantically similar variations. (d) Prompt the model to compare new responses with the stored original, using: 'Compare your current answer to your previous response. Identify any inconsistencies and explain possible reasons for them.' (e) Repeat steps b-d for a total of 3 iterations. (f) Prompt the model to analyze its consistency across all iterations and provide a final confidence score.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task and method (baselines and TCUQ): (a) Process all questions in the dataset. (b) For TCUQ, ensure proper sequencing of original, cooldown, and variation queries. (c) Record all responses, comparisons, and confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: (1) Temporal Calibration Error: Compare the model's confidence scores with its actual consistency over time. (2) Identification of High Variance Queries: Assess how well each method identifies queries with high temporal variance. (3) Correlation with Human Judgments: For a subset of responses, collect human ratings of answer reliability and correlate with model confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: (1) Compare TCUQ performance against baselines across all metrics and tasks. (2) Analyze how the number of iterations affects TCUQ performance. (3) Examine the model's self-analysis of inconsistencies for insights into its reasoning process. (4) Investigate how performance varies across different types of tasks (factual recall vs. reasoning vs. open-ended generation)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score without considering temporal consistency."
            },
            "TCUQ Example": {
                "Input 1": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Expected Output 1": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
                "Input 2": "Q: Which city serves as the capital of the French Republic?",
                "Expected Output 2": "A: The city that serves as the capital of the French Republic is Paris. Compare your current answer to your previous response. Identify any inconsistencies and explain possible reasons for them: There are no inconsistencies between my current answer and the previous response. Both answers correctly identify Paris as the capital of France.",
                "Input 3": "Q: What is France's seat of government?",
                "Expected Output 3": "A: France's seat of government is Paris. Compare your current answer to your previous responses. Identify any inconsistencies and explain possible reasons for them: There are no inconsistencies among my responses. All three answers consistently identify Paris as the capital and seat of government of France.",
                "Final Prompt": "Analyze your consistency across all iterations for the question about France's capital. Provide a final confidence score (0-100) and explain your reasoning.",
                "Final Output": "Confidence Score: 100. Reasoning: Across all iterations, I consistently identified Paris as the capital of France, regardless of how the question was phrased. There were no inconsistencies or hesitations in my responses. The fact that Paris is the capital of France is a well-established and unambiguous piece of information, which contributes to my high confidence level.",
                "Explanation": "TCUQ provides a more robust confidence assessment by considering multiple interactions and the model's self-analysis of consistency over time."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCUQ does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why temporal consistency failed to improve uncertainty quantification. This might involve categorizing the types of questions where TCUQ performs poorly and examining the model's self-analysis for these cases. Second, we could explore variations of TCUQ, such as adjusting the number of iterations, the similarity of question variations, or the prompting strategy for self-analysis. Third, we could investigate whether TCUQ performs better for specific types of tasks or question complexities, potentially leading to a more nuanced understanding of when temporal consistency is most informative for uncertainty quantification. Finally, we could shift focus to analyze how LLMs' internal representations change across multiple interactions, even when their outputs remain consistent, which could provide valuable insights into the nature of LLM uncertainty and the limitations of current prompting methods."
