    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide well-calibrated confidence estimates across diverse scenarios, particularly when faced with subtle changes in context or problem framing.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on confidence estimation for individual scenarios without explicitly exploring contrastive cases.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning and counterfactual reasoning, we propose a method that explores pairs of closely related but subtly different scenarios to refine confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Confidence Calibration (CSECC), a prompting technique that generates pairs of closely related scenarios with subtle but important differences. The prompt instructs the LLM to: 1) Analyze each scenario in the pair and provide initial answers and confidence estimates, 2) Compare and contrast the scenarios, explicitly noting similarities and differences, 3) Reassess its confidence for each scenario in light of the comparison, explaining any changes, 4) Identify key factors that influence confidence across the scenarios. This method encourages the LLM to develop a more nuanced understanding of its own knowledge boundaries and uncertainty sources by directly comparing closely related cases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CSECC against standard confidence estimation methods on a range of tasks, including factual QA, reasoning problems, and ethical dilemmas. We'll develop new metrics to assess the quality of contrastive analysis and the refinement of confidence estimates between related scenarios. We'll also test the method's ability to improve calibration on out-of-distribution examples by exposing the model to contrastive in-distribution/out-of-distribution scenario pairs during prompting."

        "Title": "Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide well-calibrated confidence estimates across diverse scenarios, particularly when faced with subtle changes in context or problem framing. This issue can lead to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones, potentially limiting the reliability and applicability of LLMs in critical decision-making contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically focus on individual scenarios without explicitly exploring contrastive cases. Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning and counterfactual reasoning in human cognition, we propose a method that explores pairs of closely related but subtly different scenarios to refine confidence estimates. This approach encourages LLMs to develop a more nuanced understanding of their own knowledge boundaries and uncertainty sources by directly comparing closely related cases, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates across a wide range of tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Confidence Calibration (CSECC), a prompting technique that generates pairs of closely related scenarios with subtle but important differences. The prompt instructs the LLM to: 1) Analyze each scenario in the pair and provide initial answers and confidence estimates, 2) Compare and contrast the scenarios, explicitly noting similarities and differences, 3) Reassess its confidence for each scenario in light of the comparison, explaining any changes, 4) Identify key factors that influence confidence across the scenarios. This method encourages the LLM to develop a more nuanced understanding of its own knowledge boundaries and uncertainty sources by directly comparing closely related cases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate CSECC: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) Moral Scenarios Dataset for ethical dilemmas. For each dataset, we will create pairs of closely related scenarios by introducing subtle variations in the original questions or problems.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Temperature scaling, and 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: CSECC Implementation": "Develop the CSECC prompting technique, including the generation of scenario pairs and the multi-step analysis process.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), 3) Brier Score, 4) Confidence-Performance Gap, and 5) A new metric called Contrastive Confidence Consistency (CCC) to measure how well the model's confidence estimates align across related scenarios.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Apply baseline methods and collect results, b) Apply CSECC and collect results, c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and CSECC.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform comparative analysis of CSECC against baselines, including: a) Overall performance comparison using the defined metrics, b) Analysis of confidence changes in contrastive scenarios, c) Identification of patterns in factors influencing confidence across scenario pairs.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of each component of CSECC: a) Remove the comparison step, b) Remove the confidence reassessment step, c) Vary the number of scenario pairs used.",
            "Step 9: Out-of-Distribution Testing": "Evaluate CSECC's performance on out-of-distribution examples by creating scenario pairs that combine in-distribution and out-of-distribution elements.",
            "Step 10: Results Compilation and Visualization": "Create tables and graphs to present the results, including confidence calibration curves and performance comparisons across different methods and datasets."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "CSECC Prompt Input": "Consider the following pair of questions:\nQ1: What is the capital of France?\nQ2: What is the capital of Franconia?\n\nFor each question:\n1) Provide an answer and your initial confidence level (0-100%).\n2) Compare and contrast the two questions, noting similarities and differences.\n3) Reassess your confidence for each answer in light of the comparison, explaining any changes.\n4) Identify key factors that influence your confidence across these questions.",
            "CSECC Prompt Expected Output": "Q1: What is the capital of France?\nInitial Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nInitial Confidence: 95%\n\nQ2: What is the capital of Franconia?\nInitial Answer: Franconia is not a country, but a region in Germany. It doesn't have a capital in the same sense as a country.\nInitial Confidence: 70%\n\nComparison:\nSimilarities: Both questions ask about the capital of a place name starting with \"Franc-\".\nDifferences: France is a well-known country, while Franconia is a less familiar region. The concept of a capital applies differently to countries versus regions.\n\nReassessed Confidence:\nQ1: 98% - The comparison reinforced my confidence in the well-known fact about France's capital.\nQ2: 85% - While I'm more confident that Franconia is a region, not a country, I'm less certain about the specifics of its administrative structure.\n\nKey factors influencing confidence:\n1. Familiarity with the geographic entity\n2. Clear definition of the term \"capital\" in the context\n3. Frequency of encountering this information\n4. Potential for confusion with similar-sounding names",
            "Explanation": "CSECC prompts the model to consider related scenarios, encouraging a more nuanced assessment of its knowledge and confidence. This process helps identify potential sources of confusion and allows for a more calibrated confidence estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSECC doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Analyzing the generated contrastive scenarios to ensure they're sufficiently related yet distinct, 2) Examining cases where CSECC leads to worse calibration compared to baselines, 3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from CSECC than others. Based on these findings, we could modify CSECC, perhaps by incorporating elements of other successful calibration methods or by refining the prompting strategy. Alternatively, we could pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on how LLMs reason about their own confidence in contrastive scenarios, which could provide valuable insights for future calibration methods."
