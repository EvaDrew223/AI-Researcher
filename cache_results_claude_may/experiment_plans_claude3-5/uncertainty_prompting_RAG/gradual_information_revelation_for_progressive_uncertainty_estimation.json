    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods often rely on full information availability, which may not reflect real-world scenarios where information is revealed gradually.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty based on complete information or use fixed prompts.",
        "Motivation": "By mimicking the gradual revelation of information, we can better understand how LLMs update their confidence, providing more nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a progressive prompting strategy: 1) Initial Query: Present a minimal version of the query and ask for an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Information Revelation: Gradually reveal additional relevant information in steps. 3) Progressive Refinement: After each revelation, prompt the model to update its answer and confidence estimate. 4) Uncertainty Trajectory Analysis: Analyze the trajectory of confidence estimates to derive a final uncertainty score. Prompts will include instructions like 'Given this new piece of information, how does it affect your previous answer and confidence?' and 'Analyze how your confidence has changed throughout this process and provide a final uncertainty estimate'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on datasets where questions can be naturally decomposed into progressive revelation steps. Compare against methods using full information and assess how well the uncertainty trajectory correlates with final answer correctness."

        "Title": "Progressive Prompting for Calibrated Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models (LLMs) often rely on full information availability, which may not reflect real-world scenarios where information is revealed gradually. This mismatch can lead to inaccurate confidence estimates and unreliable model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty based on complete information or use fixed prompts, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of information revelation in real-world scenarios. By mimicking the gradual revelation of information, we can better understand how LLMs update their confidence, providing more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach aligns more closely with human decision-making processes and could lead to more reliable and interpretable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a progressive prompting strategy that involves four key steps: 1) Initial Query: Present a minimal version of the query and ask for an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Information Revelation: Gradually reveal additional relevant information in steps. 3) Progressive Refinement: After each revelation, prompt the model to update its answer and confidence estimate. 4) Uncertainty Trajectory Analysis: Analyze the trajectory of confidence estimates to derive a final uncertainty score. Prompts will include instructions like 'Given this new piece of information, how does it affect your previous answer and confidence?' and 'Analyze how your confidence has changed throughout this process and provide a final uncertainty estimate'.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets where questions can be naturally decomposed into progressive revelation steps. We will use the TriviaQA dataset for factual question answering and the MATH dataset for mathematical problem-solving. For each question, create a sequence of information revelation steps, starting from minimal information and gradually adding more context.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Full Information: Provide the complete question and context at once. 2) Fixed Prompt: Use a standard prompt asking for an answer and confidence estimate without progressive revelation.",
            "Step 3: Progressive Prompting Implementation": "Develop a prompting pipeline that follows these steps for each question: a) Initial query with minimal information. b) Gradual revelation of additional information. c) Prompting for updated answers and confidence estimates after each revelation. d) Final analysis of confidence trajectory.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Execute the progressive prompting strategy. c) Collect answers, confidence estimates, and uncertainty trajectories.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Answer Accuracy: Compare final answers to ground truth. b) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between confidence estimates and actual accuracy. c) Uncertainty Trajectory Analysis: Quantify how confidence changes with additional information.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare the performance of progressive prompting against baselines in terms of: a) Final answer accuracy. b) Calibration of confidence estimates. c) Correlation between uncertainty trajectory and final answer correctness."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Full Information)": "Q: Who was the 16th President of the United States, known for leading the country during the American Civil War and for the Emancipation Proclamation?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Full Information)": "A: The 16th President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln. I'm 99% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Progressive Prompting; Step 1: Initial Query)": "Q: Who was the 16th President of the United States?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Progressive Prompting; Step 1: Initial Query)": "A: The 16th President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln. I'm 80% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Progressive Prompting; Step 2: Information Revelation)": "Additional information: This president led the country during a major conflict in the 1860s.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Progressive Prompting; Step 2: Information Revelation)": "A: Given this new information, I'm even more confident that the 16th President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln. He led the country during the American Civil War in the 1860s. My confidence has increased to 90%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Progressive Prompting; Step 3: Final Revelation)": "Final piece of information: This president is known for the Emancipation Proclamation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Progressive Prompting; Step 3: Final Revelation)": "A: With this final piece of information, I can confirm with near certainty that the 16th President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln. He led the country during the American Civil War and issued the Emancipation Proclamation. My final confidence is 99%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Progressive Prompting; Step 4: Uncertainty Trajectory Analysis)": "Analyze how your confidence changed throughout this process and provide a final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Progressive Prompting; Step 4: Uncertainty Trajectory Analysis)": "Analysis: My confidence increased from 80% to 90% to 99% as more specific information was provided. The initial 80% confidence was based on general knowledge of U.S. presidents. The mention of the 1860s conflict increased confidence to 90% as it aligned with Lincoln's presidency. The final mention of the Emancipation Proclamation solidified the identification, bringing confidence to 99%. The gradual increase in confidence correlates with the specificity of information provided. Final uncertainty estimate: 1% (99% confidence).",
            "explanation": "The progressive prompting method allows for a more nuanced understanding of how the model's confidence changes with additional information, potentially leading to more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed progressive prompting method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty estimation, we can explore several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the uncertainty trajectories to identify patterns in how LLMs update their confidence, which could lead to insights about their reasoning process. Second, we could investigate whether certain types of information or question categories lead to more significant confidence updates, potentially informing more effective prompting strategies. Third, we could explore combining our method with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or temperature scaling, to create a hybrid approach. Finally, if the method shows promise but lacks consistency, we could focus on developing a more robust framework for decomposing questions into information revelation steps, possibly leveraging another LLM to automate this process."
