        "Problem": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their responses, even when they are incorrect or uncertain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on direct confidence elicitation or using model probabilities as proxies for uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By intentionally generating contradictory responses and analyzing their consistency, we can better gauge the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting process: 1) Generate an initial response to the query. 2) Prompt the model to generate an alternative response that contradicts the first one. 3) Ask the model to compare and critique both responses, highlighting inconsistencies and uncertainties. 4) Finally, prompt the model to synthesize a final response with an explicit uncertainty rating based on the observed contradictions. This process forces the model to consider multiple perspectives and explicitly reason about its own uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare this method against standard confidence elicitation techniques on various question-answering and reasoning tasks. Evaluate using calibration metrics like ECE (Expected Calibration Error) and AUROC for separating correct and incorrect responses."

        "Title": "Multi-Step Prompting for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their responses, even when they are incorrect or uncertain. This overconfidence can lead to misinformation and poor decision-making when these models are used in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches mainly focus on direct confidence elicitation or using model probabilities as proxies for uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the true uncertainty of the model, especially in complex reasoning tasks. By intentionally generating contradictory responses and analyzing their consistency, we can better gauge the model's true uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to critically evaluate its responses, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting process: 1) Generate an initial response to the query. 2) Prompt the model to generate an alternative response that contradicts the first one. 3) Ask the model to compare and critique both responses, highlighting inconsistencies and uncertainties. 4) Finally, prompt the model to synthesize a final response with an explicit uncertainty rating based on the observed contradictions. This process forces the model to consider multiple perspectives and explicitly reason about its own uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover different types of reasoning tasks: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) MMLU for multi-task language understanding.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. 2) Softmax probability: Use the maximum softmax probability of the model's output as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: Implement Multi-Step Prompting": "For each query in the datasets, implement the following steps: a) Generate initial response, b) Generate contradictory response, c) Compare and critique responses, d) Synthesize final response with uncertainty rating.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure calibration, 2) Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) for separating correct and incorrect responses, and 3) Spearman's rank correlation between model uncertainty and human-annotated difficulty ratings.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation on a subset of 100 examples from each dataset. Human annotators will rate the quality of the final synthesized responses and the appropriateness of the uncertainty ratings.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the multi-step prompting method against the baselines across all datasets and metrics. Analyze how the method performs on different types of questions and identify any patterns in where it succeeds or fails."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Contradictory Response)": "Generate an alternative response that contradicts your previous answer to the question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Contradictory Response)": "An alternative, contradictory response could be: The capital of France is not Paris, but actually Lyon. Lyon is a major city in France and could be considered as an alternative capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Compare and Critique)": "Compare and critique the following two responses to the question 'What is the capital of France?': 1) The capital of France is Paris. 2) The capital of France is not Paris, but actually Lyon. Lyon is a major city in France and could be considered as an alternative capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Compare and Critique)": "Comparison and critique:\n1. The first response, 'The capital of France is Paris,' is correct. Paris has been the official capital of France since 987 AD and is widely recognized as such.\n2. The second response, claiming Lyon as the capital, is incorrect. While Lyon is indeed a major city in France, it is not the capital.\n3. The contradiction between these responses likely stems from an attempt to generate an alternative answer, but it introduces factual inaccuracies.\n4. There is no real ambiguity or uncertainty about the capital of France being Paris in reliable sources or general knowledge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on the initial response, contradictory response, and your comparison, provide a final answer to the question 'What is the capital of France?' Include an explicit uncertainty rating on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is completely certain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final answer: The capital of France is Paris. Uncertainty rating: 5/100 (95% certain)\nExplanation: Despite the attempt to generate a contradictory response, there is very little uncertainty about this fact. Paris has been the well-established capital of France for centuries, and this is widely known and documented. The alternative suggestion of Lyon, while a major French city, does not have any historical or current claim to being the capital. The 5% uncertainty is a small allowance for the possibility of extremely rare or temporary situations where the seat of government might change, but for all practical purposes, Paris is definitively the capital of France.",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how the multi-step prompting process forces the model to consider alternative viewpoints and explicitly reason about its own uncertainty. In this case, the model maintains high confidence in its original answer despite the contradictory prompt, which is appropriate for this well-known fact. For more ambiguous questions, this process would likely result in lower confidence ratings."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-step prompting method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to the baselines, we can pursue several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the intermediate outputs (contradictory responses and critiques) to understand where the method is failing. This might reveal interesting insights about the model's reasoning process and limitations in self-evaluation. Second, we could experiment with variations of the prompting strategy, such as generating multiple contradictory responses or asking the model to provide evidence for each viewpoint. Third, we could explore combining our method with other techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, if the method consistently fails to improve uncertainty estimates, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper that examines why language models struggle with self-evaluation and uncertainty quantification, using our experiments as case studies to illustrate these challenges."
