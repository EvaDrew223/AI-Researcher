        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Estimates in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to consider alternative scenarios or potential errors in their reasoning. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making and misinformation propagation. Existing calibration methods typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or statistical post-processing, which may not fully capture the nuanced uncertainties inherent in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration techniques often treat confidence estimation as a separate task from the reasoning process itself. By integrating counterfactual thinking into the confidence estimation process, we can leverage the LLM's reasoning capabilities to uncover potential flaws and alternative scenarios, leading to more robust and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This approach aligns with human expert reasoning, where considering alternative possibilities is crucial for accurate confidence assessment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Calibration (CCC), a prompting strategy that leverages hypothetical scenarios to refine uncertainty estimates. The method consists of five steps: 1) Initial Response: Obtain the model's initial answer and confidence level. 2) Counterfactual Generation: Prompt the model to generate several counterfactual scenarios that could lead to a different answer. 3) Scenario Exploration: For each counterfactual, prompt the model to reason through the implications and assess the plausibility. 4) Confidence Impact Analysis: Ask the model to analyze how each counterfactual scenario should impact the initial confidence estimate. 5) Calibrated Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize a final answer and calibrated uncertainty estimate, explicitly accounting for the counterfactual analysis.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task reasoning, and 3) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving. These datasets cover a range of tasks where confidence calibration is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Temperature scaling: use different temperature settings during generation and calibrate the output probabilities. 3) Ensemble-based calibration: use multiple model runs with different seeds and calculate confidence based on agreement.",
            "Step 3: CCC Implementation": "Implement the Counterfactual Confidence Calibration method using the following prompts for each step: 1) Initial Response: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' 2) Counterfactual Generation: 'Generate three plausible scenarios that could lead to a different answer: [QUESTION] [INITIAL_ANSWER]' 3) Scenario Exploration: 'For each scenario, explain its implications and assess its plausibility: [COUNTERFACTUALS]' 4) Confidence Impact Analysis: 'Analyze how each scenario should impact the initial confidence estimate: [SCENARIO_EXPLORATIONS]' 5) Calibrated Synthesis: 'Provide a final answer and calibrated confidence score, considering the counterfactual analysis: [QUESTION] [INITIAL_ANSWER] [CONFIDENCE_IMPACT_ANALYSIS]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the calibration performance: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): measures the difference between confidence and accuracy. 2) Brier Score: assesses both calibration and resolution of probabilistic predictions. 3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): evaluates the trade-off between precision and recall at different confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run the baseline methods and collect their outputs and confidence scores. 2) Run the CCC method and collect the outputs, including intermediate steps and final calibrated confidence scores. 3) Calculate the evaluation metrics for both baseline and CCC methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of CCC against baselines using the evaluation metrics. 2) Analyze the generated counterfactuals and their impact on confidence calibration. 3) Investigate how the performance varies across different task types and difficulty levels. 4) Examine cases where CCC significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Counterfactual Generation)": "Generate three plausible scenarios that could lead to a different answer: Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Counterfactual Generation)": "1. If the question referred to a different time period, such as before 508 AD when Clovis I made Paris the capital. 2. If there was a recent, major geopolitical change that hasn't been widely reported yet. 3. If the question was actually asking about the economic or cultural capital rather than the political capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Scenario Exploration)": "For each scenario, explain its implications and assess its plausibility: [COUNTERFACTUALS]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Scenario Exploration)": "1. Implication: The answer could be a different city like Soissons or Reims. Plausibility: Very low, as the question doesn't specify a historical time period. 2. Implication: A different city could have become the new capital. Plausibility: Extremely low, as such a major change would be widely known. 3. Implication: Cities like Lyon or Marseille could be considered. Plausibility: Low, as the question likely refers to the political capital, but there's a small chance of misinterpretation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Confidence Impact Analysis)": "Analyze how each scenario should impact the initial confidence estimate: [SCENARIO_EXPLORATIONS]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Confidence Impact Analysis)": "The first two scenarios have negligible impact due to their very low plausibility. The third scenario slightly reduces confidence as there's a small chance of misinterpreting the question. Overall, the confidence should be reduced by about 5 points to account for these unlikely but possible scenarios.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Calibrated Synthesis)": "Provide a final answer and calibrated confidence score, considering the counterfactual analysis: Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris. Initial confidence: 95. [CONFIDENCE_IMPACT_ANALYSIS]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Calibrated Synthesis)": "Final answer: The capital of France is Paris. Calibrated confidence score: 90. While Paris is almost certainly the correct answer, the analysis of potential alternative interpretations or unlikely scenarios slightly reduces our absolute certainty.",
            "Explanation": "The CCC method prompts the model to consider alternative scenarios, leading to a more nuanced confidence estimate. In this case, it slightly reduced the confidence to account for unlikely but possible misinterpretations or edge cases, resulting in a more calibrated assessment of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCC method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of counterfactuals generated, assessing their relevance and creativity, and examining how they relate to the model's knowledge and reasoning processes. Second, we could explore variations of the CCC method, such as adjusting the number of counterfactuals generated, experimenting with different prompting strategies for each step, or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide counterfactual generation. Third, we could investigate how the effectiveness of CCC varies across different types of questions or domains, potentially uncovering insights about when and why counterfactual reasoning is most beneficial for calibration. Finally, we could combine CCC with other calibration techniques, such as ensemble methods or temperature scaling, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies."
