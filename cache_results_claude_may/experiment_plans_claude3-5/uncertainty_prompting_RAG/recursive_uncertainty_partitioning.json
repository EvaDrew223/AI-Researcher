    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often provide coarse-grained confidence estimates that fail to capture the nuanced and hierarchical nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches offer a single confidence score or a simple distribution, which doesn't adequately represent the multi-level structure of uncertainty in tasks involving multiple reasoning steps or interdependent sub-questions.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by divide-and-conquer algorithms and hierarchical problem-solving strategies in human cognition, we aim to develop a method that recursively breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-components, allowing for a more granular and structured representation of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Partitioning (RUP). For a given complex query, RUP first prompts the LLM to break it down into a hierarchical structure of sub-questions or reasoning steps. For each node in this hierarchy, from the leaves up to the root, the LLM is asked to provide a confidence estimate and a brief explanation. These estimates are then aggregated bottom-up, with the confidence at each higher-level node being a function of its children's confidences and the LLM's assessment of how these sub-components contribute to the overall question. This process creates a tree-like structure of confidence estimates. At each aggregation step, the LLM is also prompted to identify potential dependencies or conflicts between sub-components that might affect the overall confidence. The final output is a rich, hierarchical representation of the LLM's uncertainty, showing how confidence in different aspects of the reasoning process contributes to the overall uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate RUP on a range of complex reasoning tasks, including multi-hop question answering, logical deductions, and open-ended analysis problems. We'll compare the overall confidence estimates against baseline methods, as well as assess the additional value provided by the hierarchical uncertainty structure. This will include measuring how well the sub-component confidences predict errors in intermediate reasoning steps. We'll also conduct user studies to determine if the hierarchical uncertainty representation helps in identifying specific areas of weakness in the LLM's reasoning or in deciding when to trust or further scrutinize the model's outputs."

        "Title": "Recursive Uncertainty Partitioning: Hierarchical Confidence Estimation for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide coarse-grained confidence estimates that fail to capture the nuanced and hierarchical nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders the ability to accurately assess the reliability of LLM outputs, particularly in multi-step reasoning processes.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically offer a single confidence score or a simple distribution, which doesn't adequately represent the multi-level structure of uncertainty in tasks involving multiple reasoning steps or interdependent sub-questions. Inspired by divide-and-conquer algorithms and hierarchical problem-solving strategies in human cognition, we aim to develop a method that recursively breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-components, allowing for a more granular and structured representation of uncertainty. This approach could provide more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates, enabling better decision-making in applications relying on LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Partitioning (RUP), a novel prompting method for hierarchical confidence estimation in LLMs. The RUP process consists of the following steps: 1) Query Decomposition: For a given complex query, prompt the LLM to break it down into a hierarchical structure of sub-questions or reasoning steps. 2) Leaf Node Evaluation: For each leaf node in the hierarchy, prompt the LLM to provide a confidence estimate and a brief explanation. 3) Bottom-up Aggregation: Starting from the leaves, prompt the LLM to aggregate confidences up the hierarchy. At each non-leaf node, the LLM assesses how the sub-components contribute to the overall question and provides a confidence estimate for that level. 4) Dependency Identification: At each aggregation step, prompt the LLM to identify potential dependencies or conflicts between sub-components that might affect the overall confidence. 5) Final Output: The result is a rich, hierarchical representation of the LLM's uncertainty, showing how confidence in different aspects of the reasoning process contributes to the overall uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate RUP: 1) Multi-hop question answering: HotpotQA dataset. 2) Logical reasoning: LogiQA dataset. 3) Open-ended analysis: A subset of the BIG-bench task suite focusing on complex reasoning tasks. For each dataset, we'll select a diverse set of 100 questions to form our test set.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods for comparison: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the LLM to provide a single confidence score for the entire question. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty. 3) Calibrated confidence estimation: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the LLM's confidence estimates.",
            "Step 3: RUP Implementation": "Implement the RUP method using the following prompts for each step: 1) Query Decomposition: 'Please break down this question into a hierarchical structure of sub-questions or reasoning steps. Format your response as a numbered list with indentation to show the hierarchy.' 2) Leaf Node Evaluation: 'For the following sub-question, provide a confidence estimate (0-100%) and a brief explanation: [sub-question]' 3) Bottom-up Aggregation: 'Given the following sub-questions and their confidence estimates, provide an overall confidence estimate for the parent question and explain how you arrived at this estimate: [parent question] [sub-questions with confidences]' 4) Dependency Identification: 'Identify any dependencies or potential conflicts between the sub-components that might affect the overall confidence estimate.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for both baselines and RUP. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo to assess the method's performance on a smaller model.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each question in our test sets, we will: 1) Generate answers and confidence estimates using each baseline method and RUP. 2) Evaluate the accuracy of the final answers. 3) Assess the calibration of confidence estimates using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). 4) For RUP, additionally evaluate the coherence and usefulness of the hierarchical uncertainty structure.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation with 5 domain experts. They will assess 20 randomly selected questions from each dataset, comparing the baseline confidence estimates with RUP's hierarchical uncertainty representation. Experts will rate: 1) Informativeness of the uncertainty representation. 2) Ability to identify specific areas of uncertainty in the reasoning process. 3) Overall usefulness for decision-making.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of RUP against baselines in terms of calibration metrics and answer accuracy. 2) Analyze how well the sub-component confidences predict errors in intermediate reasoning steps. 3) Examine patterns in the identified dependencies between sub-components. 4) Assess the correlation between the granularity of the decomposition and the quality of uncertainty estimates. 5) Compare the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo to understand how model size affects the quality of hierarchical uncertainty estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and then at 30 mph for 1 hour, what is the average speed of the entire journey? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer as a percentage.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Answer: The average speed of the entire journey is 50 mph. Confidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUP; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "Q: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours and then at 30 mph for 1 hour, what is the average speed of the entire journey? Please break down this question into a hierarchical structure of sub-questions or reasoning steps. Format your response as a numbered list with indentation to show the hierarchy.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUP; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "1. Calculate the distance traveled in the first 2 hours\n   1.1 Determine the speed for the first 2 hours\n   1.2 Determine the time for the first part of the journey\n   1.3 Calculate distance = speed * time\n2. Calculate the distance traveled in the last hour\n   2.1 Determine the speed for the last hour\n   2.2 Determine the time for the second part of the journey\n   2.3 Calculate distance = speed * time\n3. Calculate the total distance traveled\n   3.1 Sum the distances from steps 1 and 2\n4. Calculate the total time of the journey\n   4.1 Sum the times from steps 1.2 and 2.2\n5. Calculate the average speed\n   5.1 Divide total distance by total time",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUP; Step 2: Leaf Node Evaluation)": "For the following sub-question, provide a confidence estimate (0-100%) and a brief explanation: 1.1 Determine the speed for the first 2 hours",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUP; Step 2: Leaf Node Evaluation)": "Confidence: 100%\nExplanation: The speed for the first 2 hours is explicitly stated in the question as 60 mph. This is a direct fact from the given information, so there's no uncertainty in this step.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUP; Step 3: Bottom-up Aggregation)": "Given the following sub-questions and their confidence estimates, provide an overall confidence estimate for the parent question and explain how you arrived at this estimate:\nParent question: 1. Calculate the distance traveled in the first 2 hours\nSub-questions with confidences:\n1.1 Determine the speed for the first 2 hours (100%)\n1.2 Determine the time for the first part of the journey (100%)\n1.3 Calculate distance = speed * time (95%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUP; Step 3: Bottom-up Aggregation)": "Overall confidence for calculating the distance traveled in the first 2 hours: 95%\nExplanation: The confidence for this step is primarily determined by the lowest confidence among its sub-components. While we have 100% confidence in knowing the speed and time, there's a slight uncertainty (95%) in the calculation step. This could be due to potential rounding errors or the possibility of a calculation mistake. Therefore, the overall confidence for this step is 95%, reflecting the uncertainty in the calculation process.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUP; Step 4: Dependency Identification)": "Identify any dependencies or potential conflicts between the sub-components that might affect the overall confidence estimate for calculating the average speed of the entire journey.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUP; Step 4: Dependency Identification)": "Dependencies and potential conflicts:\n1. The calculation of total distance (step 3) depends on the accuracy of both distance calculations (steps 1 and 2). Any error in either of these steps will propagate to the total distance.\n2. The average speed calculation (step 5) depends on both the total distance and total time calculations. An error in either of these will affect the final result.\n3. There's a potential for compounding errors, where small uncertainties in earlier steps could lead to larger uncertainties in the final result.\n4. The confidence in the final answer cannot be higher than the lowest confidence in any of the critical steps (distance calculations, time calculation, and final average speed calculation).\n5. There are no direct conflicts between the sub-components, as each step logically follows from the previous ones.",
            "explanation": "The RUP method provides a more detailed and nuanced view of the confidence estimation process. By breaking down the problem into sub-components and evaluating each separately, it allows for identification of specific areas of uncertainty. The hierarchical structure also reveals dependencies between different parts of the reasoning process, which can help in understanding how errors might propagate and affect the final confidence estimate. This granular approach contrasts with the baseline method, which only provides a single overall confidence score without insight into its derivation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RUP method doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods in terms of calibration metrics or human evaluation scores, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why RUP fails to improve confidence estimates. This could involve examining patterns in the query decompositions, identifying types of questions where RUP performs poorly, and analyzing the relationship between decomposition granularity and estimation quality. 2) Investigate whether RUP provides benefits in specific subsets of questions or reasoning types, even if it doesn't show overall improvements. This could lead to insights about when hierarchical uncertainty estimation is most useful. 3) Explore modifications to the RUP method, such as incorporating external knowledge sources at leaf nodes, or using a hybrid approach that combines RUP with other uncertainty estimation techniques. 4) Shift focus to using RUP as an explanatory tool rather than a pure confidence estimation method. We could evaluate its effectiveness in helping users understand the reasoning process and identify potential weaknesses in the model's logic, even if the final confidence estimates aren't significantly improved."
