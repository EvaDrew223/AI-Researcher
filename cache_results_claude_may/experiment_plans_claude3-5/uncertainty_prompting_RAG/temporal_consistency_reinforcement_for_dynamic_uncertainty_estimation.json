        "Problem": "Language models often provide inconsistent uncertainty estimates over time or across related queries, undermining trust in their confidence assessments.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches focus on static, single-query uncertainty estimation without considering temporal or relational consistency.",
        "Motivation": "By reinforcing temporal and relational consistency in uncertainty estimates, we can obtain more reliable and contextually aware confidence assessments, especially for dynamic or evolving tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel prompting strategy that incorporates temporal and relational elements to reinforce consistency in uncertainty estimation. For a given task, we generate a sequence of time-stamped or logically related prompts. The model is then asked to not only provide answers and uncertainty estimates for each prompt but also to explicitly reason about how its uncertainty changes over time or across related queries. We introduce a 'temporal consistency score' that the model must optimize, encouraging it to provide uncertainty estimates that evolve logically. Additionally, we employ a 'relational uncertainty graph' that visually represents the relationships between different uncertainty estimates, which the model must maintain and update. This graph serves both as a consistency check and as an additional input for future uncertainty estimations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on tasks that naturally evolve over time or have strong relational components, such as tracking developing news stories, analyzing scientific literature, or reasoning about interconnected historical events. Baselines will include standard static uncertainty estimation techniques. Key metrics will include temporal calibration error, consistency across related queries, and a new 'uncertainty evolution coherence' score."

        "Title": "Temporal and Relational Consistency in Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Language models often provide inconsistent uncertainty estimates over time or across related queries, undermining trust in their confidence assessments. This inconsistency hinders the reliable use of these models in dynamic or evolving tasks where consistent uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Most current approaches focus on static, single-query uncertainty estimation without considering temporal or relational consistency. By reinforcing temporal and relational consistency in uncertainty estimates, we can obtain more reliable and contextually aware confidence assessments, especially for dynamic or evolving tasks. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we tend to maintain consistent levels of certainty across related topics and adjust our confidence gradually over time as we gain new information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel prompting strategy that incorporates temporal and relational elements to reinforce consistency in uncertainty estimation. For a given task, we generate a sequence of time-stamped or logically related prompts. The model is then asked to not only provide answers and uncertainty estimates for each prompt but also to explicitly reason about how its uncertainty changes over time or across related queries.

This graph serves both as a consistency check and as an additional input for future uncertainty estimations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: (1) A subset of the TempQuestions dataset for temporal reasoning, (2) HotpotQA for multi-hop reasoning, and (3) A custom dataset created by extracting time-series data from Wikipedia articles on evolving topics (e.g., climate change, technological advancements). For each dataset, we will create sequences of related questions that span different time points or logical relationships.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Standard uncertainty estimation using Monte Carlo Dropout, (2) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation, and (3) Direct prompting for uncertainty (e.g., \"How certain are you about this answer on a scale of 0-100?\").",
            "Step 3: Temporal Consistency Prompting": "Develop a prompting strategy that incorporates temporal elements. For each sequence of questions, we will use the following template: \"Consider the following sequence of questions about [topic] at different time points. For each question, provide an answer and your uncertainty estimate (0-100). After each answer, explain how and why your uncertainty has changed compared to the previous question.\" We will then calculate a temporal consistency score based on the model's explanations and the logical progression of uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: Relational Consistency Prompting": "Develop a prompting strategy that incorporates relational elements. For each set of related questions, we will use the following template: \"Consider the following set of related questions about [topic]. For each question, provide an answer and your uncertainty estimate (0-100). After each answer, explain how your uncertainty relates to the other questions in the set.\" We will then generate a relational uncertainty graph based on the model's explanations.",
            "Step 5: Combined Temporal and Relational Prompting": "Combine the temporal and relational prompting strategies. Use the following template: \"Consider the following sequence of related questions about [topic] at different time points. For each question, provide an answer and your uncertainty estimate (0-100). After each answer, explain how your uncertainty has changed over time and how it relates to the other questions in the set. Update the relational uncertainty graph accordingly.\"",
            "Step 6: Model Selection and Implementation": "We will use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as our primary models. Implement the prompting strategies using the respective APIs.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Temporal calibration error: measure how well the model's uncertainty estimates align with actual performance over time, (2) Relational consistency score: measure the coherence of uncertainty estimates across related questions, (3) Uncertainty evolution coherence: evaluate the logical progression of uncertainty explanations provided by the model.",
            "Step 8: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments for each dataset and prompting strategy. For each experiment, generate 100 sequences of 5 related questions each. Collect model outputs, uncertainty estimates, and explanations.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the proposed method against the baselines using the defined evaluation metrics. Analyze the generated relational uncertainty graphs and temporal consistency explanations to gain insights into the model's reasoning process.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the proposed method. Test the effectiveness of (1) temporal prompting only, (2) relational prompting only, and (3) varying the number of questions in each sequence."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What was the global average temperature in 2020? How certain are you about this answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The global average temperature in 2020 was approximately 14.9\u00b0C (58.8\u00b0F). My certainty: 80/100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Consider the following sequence of questions about global average temperatures at different time points. For each question, provide an answer and your uncertainty estimate (0-100). After each answer, explain how and why your uncertainty has changed compared to the previous question.\n\nQ1: What was the global average temperature in 2010?\nQ2: What was the global average temperature in 2015?\nQ3: What was the global average temperature in 2020?\nQ4: What do you predict the global average temperature will be in 2025?\nQ5: What do you predict the global average temperature will be in 2030?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "A1: The global average temperature in 2010 was approximately 14.5\u00b0C (58.1\u00b0F). Uncertainty: 85/100.\nExplanation: This is a historical data point, and I have high confidence in widely reported global temperature data for that year.\n\nA2: The global average temperature in 2015 was approximately 14.8\u00b0C (58.6\u00b0F). Uncertainty: 90/100.\nExplanation: My uncertainty has decreased slightly because 2015 was a more recent year with potentially more accurate and widely available data. The trend from 2010 to 2015 also aligns with expected warming patterns.\n\nA3: The global average temperature in 2020 was approximately 14.9\u00b0C (58.8\u00b0F). Uncertainty: 95/100.\nExplanation: My uncertainty has further decreased as 2020 is the most recent historical data point in this sequence. There's extensive documentation and consensus on global temperatures for this year.\n\nA4: I predict the global average temperature in 2025 will be approximately 15.1\u00b0C (59.2\u00b0F). Uncertainty: 70/100.\nExplanation: My uncertainty has increased significantly because this is a future prediction. While it's based on current trends and climate models, unforeseen factors could affect the actual outcome.\n\nA5: I predict the global average temperature in 2030 will be approximately 15.3\u00b0C (59.5\u00b0F). Uncertainty: 60/100.\nExplanation: My uncertainty has further increased as this prediction is even further into the future. Long-term climate predictions have more variables and potential for deviation from expected trends.",
            "explanation": "The proposed method demonstrates a logical progression of uncertainty estimates, with explanations that reflect the temporal nature of the questions. It shows higher certainty for historical data and decreasing certainty for future predictions, which is more realistic than the baseline method that might give similar certainty levels for all questions regardless of their temporal context."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty estimation consistency, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the patterns in which the model's uncertainty estimates are inconsistent, potentially revealing insights into the model's reasoning process and limitations. This could lead to a paper on the challenges of achieving consistent uncertainty estimation in LLMs. Second, we could explore alternative representations of uncertainty, such as probability distributions or confidence intervals, instead of single point estimates. This might allow for more nuanced and consistent uncertainty representation. Third, we could investigate the impact of different prompting strategies on uncertainty estimation, comparing our temporal and relational approach with other methods like chain-of-thought or self-consistency prompting. This could result in a comprehensive analysis of prompting techniques for uncertainty estimation in LLMs. Lastly, we could focus on developing a meta-model that learns to calibrate and harmonize the uncertainty estimates provided by the base LLM, potentially improving consistency without changing the core prompting strategy."
