        "Problem": "Language models often exhibit overconfidence bias and struggle to identify edge cases or potential flaws in their reasoning, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates.",

        "Title": "Adversarial Persona Shifting for Robust Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence bias and struggle to identify edge cases or potential flaws in their reasoning, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. This problem is particularly critical in high-stakes applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial for decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for uncertainty estimation in language models typically rely on single-perspective assessments or limited forms of self-critique, which may not comprehensively challenge the model's assumptions. Inspired by adversarial training and the principle of steel-manning arguments, we propose that adopting multiple, opposing expert personas can help the model more thoroughly probe its own knowledge boundaries and potential weaknesses. This approach aims to leverage the model's ability to role-play different perspectives, thereby creating a more robust and comprehensive uncertainty estimation process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Adversarial Persona Shifting for Robust Uncertainty Estimation (APSRUE), a multi-step prompting method: 1) Persona Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple expert personas with diverse, sometimes opposing viewpoints relevant to the query. 2) Multi-Persona Debate: Initiate a structured debate among these personas, each challenging the others' assertions and reasoning. 3) Weakness Identification: Prompt each persona to identify potential weaknesses or edge cases in their own and others' arguments. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Based on the debate and weakness analysis, prompt the model to synthesize an uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diverse perspectives and identified limitations. 5) Meta-Cognitive Reflection: Finally, prompt the model to reflect on the entire process, potentially adjusting its uncertainty estimate based on the quality and diversity of the debate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, and 3) BIG-Bench's Logical Fallacy task for critical thinking. These datasets cover a range of domains and reasoning types, allowing us to test the robustness of our method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting with temperature sampling, 2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and 3) Ensemble of differently prompted models. For each baseline, we'll use the variance in predictions as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: APSRUE Implementation": "Implement our APSRUE method with the following sub-steps: a) Persona Generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 expert personas with diverse backgrounds relevant to the question. b) Multi-Persona Debate: Create a dialogue format where each persona presents their view and challenges others. c) Weakness Identification: Prompt each persona to point out potential flaws in all arguments, including their own. d) Uncertainty Synthesis: Ask the model to synthesize an uncertainty estimate based on the debate. e) Meta-Cognitive Reflection: Prompt the model to reflect on the process and adjust the uncertainty if needed.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and APSRUE): a) Run the method on all questions in the dataset. b) For APSRUE, use GPT-4 as the main model due to its strong multi-turn conversation abilities. c) Collect model outputs, including final answers and uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. b) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess how well the uncertainty estimates align with actual accuracy. c) Uncertainty Quality: Introduce a new metric, 'Edge Case Identification Rate' (ECIR), measuring how often the method identifies valid edge cases or limitations. d) Compute these metrics for both baselines and APSRUE.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: a) Compare APSRUE against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze how the number of personas affects performance. c) Examine cases where APSRUE significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. d) Evaluate the quality and diversity of generated personas and debates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the boiling point of water?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The boiling point of water is 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F) at sea level. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APSRUE; Step 1: Persona Generation)": "Generate 3-5 expert personas with diverse backgrounds relevant to discussing the boiling point of water. Each persona should have a unique perspective or area of expertise.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APSRUE; Step 1: Persona Generation)": "1. Dr. Emily Chen: Physical Chemist specializing in thermodynamics\n2. Prof. Ahmed Hassan: Environmental Scientist focusing on high-altitude ecosystems\n3. Chef Maria Rodriguez: Professional chef with expertise in molecular gastronomy\n4. Engineer Pat Johnson: Mechanical engineer working on pressure vessels",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APSRUE; Step 2: Multi-Persona Debate)": "Initiate a debate among the generated personas about the boiling point of water. Each persona should present their view and challenge others' perspectives.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APSRUE; Step 2: Multi-Persona Debate)": "Dr. Chen: The boiling point of water is 100\u00b0C at 1 atm pressure, but it's crucial to note that this can vary with pressure changes.\nProf. Hassan: Indeed, and in high-altitude regions, water boils at lower temperatures due to decreased atmospheric pressure.\nChef Rodriguez: In cooking, we often use this principle. For instance, in pressure cookers, we increase the boiling point by increasing pressure.\nEngineer Johnson: Correct, and in industrial applications, we manipulate pressure to control boiling points in various processes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APSRUE; Step 3: Weakness Identification)": "For each persona, identify potential weaknesses or edge cases in all arguments presented, including their own.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APSRUE; Step 3: Weakness Identification)": "Dr. Chen: My statement doesn't account for the effects of dissolved solutes on boiling point elevation.\nProf. Hassan: I didn't specify exact temperatures for different altitudes, which could be crucial for precise applications.\nChef Rodriguez: I didn't mention that the relationship between pressure and boiling point isn't linear, which could lead to misconceptions.\nEngineer Johnson: I didn't address how the purity of water can affect its boiling point in industrial settings.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APSRUE; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the debate and identified weaknesses, synthesize an uncertainty estimate for the statement 'The boiling point of water is 100\u00b0C.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APSRUE; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Uncertainty Estimate: Medium-Low (70% confident)\nReasoning: While 100\u00b0C is correct under standard conditions (1 atm, pure water), the debate highlighted significant factors that can alter this value: pressure variations, altitude, dissolved solutes, and water purity. The uncertainty mainly stems from the lack of specificity in the original statement regarding these conditions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APSRUE; Step 5: Meta-Cognitive Reflection)": "Reflect on the entire process of generating this uncertainty estimate. Consider the quality and diversity of the debate, and adjust the estimate if needed.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APSRUE; Step 5: Meta-Cognitive Reflection)": "Upon reflection, the uncertainty estimate of 70% confidence seems appropriate. The debate included diverse perspectives from chemistry, environmental science, culinary arts, and engineering, providing a comprehensive view of the factors affecting water's boiling point. The identified weaknesses effectively highlighted the complexities involved. However, we could have explored more extreme conditions or rare scenarios that might further affect the boiling point. Given this, I maintain the 70% confidence level, acknowledging both the thorough discussion and the potential for additional edge cases.",
            "Explanation": "APSRUE provides a more nuanced and robust uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline. It considers multiple expert perspectives, identifies potential weaknesses, and reflects on the process, leading to a more calibrated confidence level that acknowledges the complexities involved in determining water's boiling point under various conditions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If APSRUE doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated personas and debates to understand why they didn't lead to improved uncertainty estimates. This could reveal interesting insights about the model's reasoning process and limitations. 2) Experiment with different prompt structures or persona generation techniques to see if we can improve the quality and diversity of the debates. 3) Investigate whether APSRUE performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Explore combining APSRUE with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to create a hybrid approach. 5) If the method shows promise in identifying edge cases but not in improving overall uncertainty estimates, we could refocus the project on using adversarial persona shifting as a tool for discovering potential flaws or limitations in model responses, rather than for uncertainty estimation."
