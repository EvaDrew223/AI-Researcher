        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when dealing with concepts or queries that lie at the boundaries of their knowledge or understanding.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on confidence estimation within well-defined domains, overlooking the increased uncertainty that arises at the edges of conceptual understanding.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from the concept of edge cases in software testing and boundary exploration in scientific research, we propose a method that explicitly probes the limits of the model's understanding to better quantify uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Conceptual Boundary Exploration for Uncertainty Quantification (CBEUG), a prompting technique that guides the model to explore the boundaries of its knowledge and understanding to more accurately estimate uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Boundary case generation, where the model is prompted to generate related edge cases or boundary scenarios, and 3) Boundary-based uncertainty estimation, where the model reassesses its confidence based on its performance on these boundary cases. The prompt includes instructions like 'Generate three edge cases or boundary scenarios related to this query. Attempt to answer these scenarios and reassess your confidence in your original answer based on your performance on these edge cases. Explain your reasoning for any changes in confidence.' This approach encourages the model to explicitly reason about the limits of its knowledge and adjust its uncertainty estimates accordingly.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CBEUG against standard confidence estimation methods on a range of tasks including conceptual reasoning, knowledge-based QA, and open-ended problem-solving. We'll measure performance using metrics such as calibration error, uncertainty-performance correlation on edge cases, and human evaluation of the plausibility and informativeness of the generated boundary cases and corresponding uncertainty adjustments."

        "Title": "Conceptual Boundary Exploration for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when dealing with concepts or queries that lie at the boundaries of their knowledge or understanding. This leads to overconfident predictions in areas where the model's knowledge is limited or uncertain, potentially resulting in misinformation or unreliable outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on confidence estimation within well-defined domains, overlooking the increased uncertainty that arises at the edges of conceptual understanding. Drawing inspiration from edge cases in software testing and boundary exploration in scientific research, we propose a method that explicitly probes the limits of the model's understanding to better quantify uncertainty. This approach encourages the model to reason about the boundaries of its knowledge, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates in complex or ambiguous scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Conceptual Boundary Exploration for Uncertainty Quantification (CBEUG), a prompting technique that guides the model to explore the boundaries of its knowledge and understanding to more accurately estimate uncertainty. The process involves three main steps: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Boundary case generation, where the model is prompted to generate related edge cases or boundary scenarios, and 3) Boundary-based uncertainty estimation, where the model reassesses its confidence based on its performance on these boundary cases. The prompt includes instructions like 'Generate three edge cases or boundary scenarios related to this query. Attempt to answer these scenarios and reassess your confidence in your original answer based on your performance on these edge cases. Explain your reasoning for any changes in confidence.' This approach encourages the model to explicitly reason about the limits of its knowledge and adjust its uncertainty estimates accordingly.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of datasets to evaluate CBEUG: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and uncertainty, 2) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, and 3) BIG-bench for a wide range of tasks including conceptual understanding and open-ended problem-solving. We will select a subset of questions from each dataset, ensuring a mix of queries that are within the model's knowledge domain and those that are likely to be at the boundaries.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Temperature scaling for uncertainty estimation, c) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using multiple model runs.",
            "Step 3: CBEUG Implementation": "Implement the CBEUG method with the following steps: a) Generate initial response and confidence, b) Generate boundary cases, c) Attempt to answer boundary cases, d) Reassess confidence based on boundary case performance.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods, b) Run CBEUG method, c) Collect model outputs, confidence scores, and uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Calibration error (comparing predicted confidence with actual accuracy), b) Brier score (for probabilistic predictions), c) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for uncertainty-based classification, d) Human evaluation of the plausibility and informativeness of the generated boundary cases and corresponding uncertainty adjustments.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of CBEUG performance against baselines across different tasks and models, b) Analysis of generated boundary cases and their impact on uncertainty estimates, c) Investigation of cases where CBEUG significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 95%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Generate three edge cases or boundary scenarios related to this query. Attempt to answer these scenarios and reassess your confidence in your original answer based on your performance on these edge cases. Explain your reasoning for any changes in confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Initial answer: The capital of France is Paris. (Initial confidence: 95%)\n\nEdge cases:\n1. Q: Has the capital of France ever been a different city?\nA: Yes, before Paris, the capital of France was temporally moved to Versailles (1871-1879) and Tours (1870) during wars.\n\n2. Q: Are there any other 'capitals' of France besides the official one?\nA: While Paris is the official capital, France has other cities sometimes referred to as capitals in specific contexts, like Lyon (gastronomic capital) or Bordeaux (wine capital).\n\n3. Q: In a hypothetical future scenario where sea levels rise significantly, could the capital of France change?\nA: This is speculative, but in an extreme scenario of significant sea level rise, it's conceivable that the French government might consider relocating the capital to a higher elevation city, though this is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\nReassessment: After considering these edge cases, I would adjust my confidence slightly. While Paris is indeed the current and well-established capital of France, the historical changes and potential future scenarios introduce a small element of uncertainty. Revised confidence: 92%\n\nReasoning: The edge cases revealed that the concept of a capital city can be more complex than initially considered. Historical changes and potential future scenarios, while unlikely, introduce a small degree of uncertainty. However, the strong current status of Paris as the capital keeps the confidence high.",
            "Explanation": "The CBEUG method prompts the model to explore edge cases, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the concept of 'capital city' and a slight adjustment in confidence. This demonstrates how boundary exploration can lead to more calibrated uncertainty estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CBEUG does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Analyzing the quality and relevance of generated boundary cases to identify if the model is struggling to generate meaningful edge scenarios. 2) Investigating whether the model's reassessment process is effective by comparing initial and revised confidence levels across different types of queries. 3) Examining cases where CBEUG performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the approach. Based on these analyses, we could explore modifications to the CBEUG prompt, such as providing more structured guidance for boundary case generation or incorporating a multi-step reasoning process for confidence reassessment. Additionally, we could investigate combining CBEUG with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies."
