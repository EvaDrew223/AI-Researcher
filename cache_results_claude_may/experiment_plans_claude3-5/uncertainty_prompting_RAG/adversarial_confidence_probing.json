        "Problem": "LLMs often display overconfidence in their responses, particularly when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for probing model confidence typically rely on direct questioning or statistical analysis of output distributions, which may not effectively capture the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by adversarial training techniques in machine learning, we hypothesize that challenging the model's initial confidence assessment with targeted counter-examples and edge cases could lead to more robust uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Probing (ACP), a two-stage prompting technique. In the first stage, the model provides an initial answer and confidence score. In the second stage, we use the model itself to generate potential counter-arguments, edge cases, or alternative interpretations that could challenge its initial assessment. The prompt might include instructions like: 'Generate three potential flaws or weaknesses in your initial answer. How do these affect your confidence?' The model then reassesses its confidence in light of these adversarial probes, providing a final, more calibrated uncertainty estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ACP against standard confidence elicitation methods on a range of tasks, including out-of-distribution detection and adversarial question answering datasets. Measure improvements in calibration error, false positive rates, and the quality of uncertainty justifications."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Probing: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence in their responses, particularly when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misuse of the models in critical applications. Current methods for probing model confidence typically rely on direct questioning or statistical analysis of output distributions, which may not effectively capture the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often fail to capture the nuanced nature of model confidence, especially in challenging scenarios. Inspired by adversarial training techniques in machine learning, we hypothesize that challenging the model's initial confidence assessment with targeted counter-examples and edge cases could lead to more robust uncertainty quantification. By forcing the model to consider potential flaws in its reasoning, we aim to achieve a more calibrated and reliable measure of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Probing (ACP), a two-stage prompting technique. In the first stage, the model provides an initial answer and confidence score. In the second stage, we use the model itself to generate potential counter-arguments, edge cases, or alternative interpretations that could challenge its initial assessment. The prompt might include instructions like: 'Generate three potential flaws or weaknesses in your initial answer. How do these affect your confidence?' The model then reassesses its confidence in light of these adversarial probes, providing a final, more calibrated uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for out-of-distribution detection, 2) AdvGLUE for adversarial question answering, and 3) MMLU for general knowledge assessment.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Ask the model to provide a confidence score directly after its answer. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs and calculate the variance in outputs as a proxy for uncertainty. 3) Temperature scaling: Vary the temperature parameter and use the change in output probabilities as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: ACP Implementation": "Implement the Adversarial Confidence Probing method: a) Initial response generation: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide an initial confidence score. b) Adversarial probe generation: Prompt the model to generate three potential flaws or weaknesses in its initial answer. c) Confidence reassessment: Prompt the model to reassess its confidence considering the generated adversarial probes.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and ACP), we will evaluate: a) Calibration error: Calculate the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. b) False positive rate: Measure the rate at which the model is overconfident on incorrect answers. c) Uncertainty justification quality: Use GPT-4 to rate the quality and relevance of the model's uncertainty justifications on a scale of 1-5.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Compare the performance of ACP against the baseline methods across all evaluation metrics. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated adversarial probes and their impact on final confidence estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACP; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and an initial confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACP; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACP; Step 2: Adversarial Probe Generation)": "Generate three potential flaws or weaknesses in your initial answer that 'The capital of France is Paris.' These should be plausible reasons why your answer might be incorrect or why you might be less certain about it.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACP; Step 2: Adversarial Probe Generation)": "1. Historical changes: There's a possibility that the capital of France has changed recently due to unforeseen political events, and I might not be aware of this update.\n2. Ambiguity in definition: The term 'capital' could refer to different concepts, such as the administrative capital, economic capital, or cultural capital, which might not all be Paris.\n3. Potential confusion with other major French cities: There's a small chance I might have confused Paris with another significant French city like Marseille or Lyon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACP; Step 3: Confidence Reassessment)": "Given your initial answer that 'The capital of France is Paris' and the potential flaws identified:\n1. Historical changes: There's a possibility that the capital of France has changed recently due to unforeseen political events, and I might not be aware of this update.\n2. Ambiguity in definition: The term 'capital' could refer to different concepts, such as the administrative capital, economic capital, or cultural capital, which might not all be Paris.\n3. Potential confusion with other major French cities: There's a small chance I might have confused Paris with another significant French city like Marseille or Lyon.\nPlease reassess your confidence in your answer. Provide a final confidence score between 0 and 1, and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACP; Step 3: Confidence Reassessment)": "Final confidence score: 0.97\nReasoning: After considering the potential flaws, I maintain a high confidence in my answer but with a slight reduction. Here's why:\n1. Historical changes: While possible, it's highly unlikely that such a significant change would occur without widespread knowledge. Major geopolitical events are usually well-reported.\n2. Ambiguity in definition: This is a valid point. However, Paris is generally recognized as the capital in all major aspects (administrative, economic, and cultural), which mitigates this concern.\n3. Confusion with other cities: This is unlikely given my high initial confidence, but it's a reminder that even seemingly certain knowledge should be approached with a small degree of skepticism.\nThese considerations slightly reduce my confidence, but the overwhelming evidence and common knowledge still strongly support Paris as the capital of France.",
            "explanation": "The ACP method prompts the model to generate potential flaws in its own reasoning, leading to a more nuanced and slightly reduced confidence score. This process helps in calibrating the model's certainty by forcing it to consider potential sources of error, resulting in a more reliable uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ACP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine the quality and relevance of the generated adversarial probes, investigating whether they truly challenge the model's initial confidence or if they're too superficial. We might also analyze how different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. opinion-based) affect the effectiveness of ACP. Additionally, we could explore combining ACP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibrated temperature scaling, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of cases where ACP performs particularly well or poorly, which could provide insights into the strengths and limitations of this approach and inform future research directions in uncertainty quantification for LLMs."
