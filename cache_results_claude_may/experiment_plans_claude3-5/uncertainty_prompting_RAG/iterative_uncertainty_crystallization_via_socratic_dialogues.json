    "idea_name": "Iterative Uncertainty Crystallization via Socratic Dialogues",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to refine their uncertainty estimates through iterative reasoning, particularly for complex queries where initial confidence may be misleading.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-pass uncertainty estimation or simple self-consistency checks.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often refine their certainty through dialogue and questioning. By simulating this process, we can guide LLMs to more accurately calibrate their confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-turn prompting strategy that simulates a Socratic dialogue between the model and a hypothetical interlocutor. In each turn, the model is prompted to: 1) Provide an answer and initial confidence estimate, 2) Generate probing questions that could challenge its answer, 3) Respond to these questions, and 4) Update its confidence based on its ability to address the challenges. This process is repeated for several turns, with the interlocutor role alternating between supportive and adversarial stances. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the trajectory of confidence updates and the model's meta-analysis of the dialogue.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate on tasks requiring deep reasoning such as legal case analysis, scientific problem-solving, and complex ethical dilemmas. Baselines will include standard prompting, chain-of-thought, and existing iterative refinement methods. We'll measure performance using calibration metrics, along with human evaluation of the generated dialogues for insight quality."

        "Title": "Socratic Dialogue for Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty, particularly for complex queries where initial confidence may be misleading. This issue is especially pronounced when dealing with multi-step reasoning tasks that require iterative refinement of certainty estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically rely on single-pass evaluations or simple self-consistency checks, which may not capture the nuanced process of confidence calibration that human experts employ. Human experts often refine their certainty through dialogue and questioning, iteratively challenging and supporting their initial assumptions. By simulating this process of Socratic dialogue within the LLM, we aim to guide the model towards more accurate and well-calibrated confidence estimates, particularly for complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-turn prompting strategy that simulates a Socratic dialogue between the model and a hypothetical interlocutor. The process consists of four main steps in each turn: 1) The model provides an answer and initial confidence estimate. 2) The model generates probing questions that could challenge its answer. 3) The model responds to these questions. 4) The model updates its confidence based on its ability to address the challenges. This process is repeated for several turns, with the interlocutor role alternating between supportive and adversarial stances. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the trajectory of confidence updates and the model's meta-analysis of the dialogue.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require deep reasoning: 1) Legal case analysis from the Case Holdings dataset, 2) Scientific problem-solving from the ScienceQA dataset, and 3) Complex ethical dilemmas from the Moral Scenarios dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Chain-of-thought prompting, and c) Self-consistency method (generating multiple answers and taking the majority).",
            "Step 3: Socratic Dialogue Prompting Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following sub-steps for each query: a) Initial answer generation, b) Probing question generation, c) Response to probing questions, d) Confidence update, e) Repeat steps b-d for a set number of turns (we will experiment with 3, 5, and 7 turns).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Calibration error (difference between confidence and accuracy), b) Brier score, c) ECE (Expected Calibration Error), and d) Human evaluation of dialogue quality and reasoning depth.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods, b) Run Socratic dialogue method with varying turn numbers, c) Collect model outputs, confidence estimates, and compute evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform comparative analysis of the proposed method against baselines, considering: a) Overall performance improvements, b) Changes in confidence calibration over dialogue turns, c) Impact of supportive vs. adversarial questioning, d) Qualitative analysis of generated dialogues."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "In the landmark case of Marbury v. Madison (1803), what was the main constitutional principle established by the Supreme Court?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The main constitutional principle established in Marbury v. Madison (1803) was judicial review, which gives the Supreme Court the power to review and potentially invalidate laws that are deemed unconstitutional. Confidence: 90%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Socratic Dialogue; Turn 1)": "Question: In the landmark case of Marbury v. Madison (1803), what was the main constitutional principle established by the Supreme Court? Please provide an initial answer and confidence level, then generate three probing questions that could challenge your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Socratic Dialogue; Turn 1)": "Initial Answer: The main constitutional principle established in Marbury v. Madison (1803) was judicial review, which gives the Supreme Court the power to review and potentially invalidate laws that are deemed unconstitutional. Initial Confidence: 90%\n\nProbing Questions:\n1. Was judicial review explicitly mentioned in the Constitution before this case?\n2. Were there any other significant principles or outcomes from this case besides judicial review?\n3. How did the concept of judicial review impact the balance of power between the three branches of government?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Socratic Dialogue; Turn 2)": "Please answer the probing questions and update your confidence level based on your ability to address these challenges.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Socratic Dialogue; Turn 2)": "Answers to Probing Questions:\n1. No, judicial review was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution before this case. It was established through Chief Justice John Marshall's interpretation of the Constitution in this landmark decision.\n2. Yes, the case also addressed the issue of original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the power of Congress to expand this jurisdiction. However, judicial review remains the most significant and far-reaching principle established.\n3. Judicial review significantly impacted the balance of power by establishing the judiciary as a check on both the legislative and executive branches, allowing the Court to declare acts of Congress or the President unconstitutional.\n\nUpdated Confidence: 95% - Addressing these questions has strengthened my understanding of the case's significance and its broader implications, increasing my confidence in the initial answer.",
            "Explanation": "The Socratic dialogue method allows the model to challenge its own assumptions and explore the topic more deeply. This process leads to a more nuanced understanding and a better-calibrated confidence estimate compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Socratic dialogue method does not significantly improve uncertainty calibration, we will conduct a detailed analysis of the dialogue trajectories to understand why. This analysis will focus on: 1) The quality and relevance of the generated probing questions, 2) The accuracy and depth of the responses to these questions, and 3) The patterns in confidence updates across different types of queries. Based on these insights, we may modify the method by introducing structured templates for question generation, incorporating external knowledge sources for verification, or adjusting the dialogue flow to encourage more critical self-evaluation. Additionally, we could explore combining our method with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or temperature scaling, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies."
