    "idea_name": "Contrastive Uncertainty Amplification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to express appropriate levels of uncertainty, particularly in cases where they have partial or conflicting knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on calibrating confidence scores or eliciting direct uncertainty estimates from the model.",
        "Motivation": "By deliberately introducing contrasting information or perspectives, we can amplify the model's inherent uncertainties and force a more nuanced expression of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Uncertainty Amplification (CUA), a prompting technique that strategically presents the model with contrasting information or viewpoints to heighten its expression of uncertainty. The prompt includes three main components: 1) The original query, 2) A 'contrast set' of related information that partially supports and partially contradicts potential answers, and 3) Instructions for the model to analyze the contrasts and express its uncertainty in light of the conflicting information. CUA also incorporates a 'resolution attempt' phase where the model tries to reconcile the contrasts, followed by a final 'amplified uncertainty' statement that captures the nuanced confidence level considering all presented information.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CUA against standard confidence elicitation methods on tasks involving ambiguous or controversial topics, multi-faceted problems, and scenarios with incomplete information. Evaluate improvements in expressing appropriate levels of uncertainty, detecting knowledge conflicts, and providing nuanced confidence estimates that reflect the complexity of the information landscape."

        "Title": "Contrastive Uncertainty Amplification: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to express appropriate levels of uncertainty, particularly in cases where they have partial or conflicting knowledge. This can lead to overconfident assertions in situations where the model should express more nuanced or cautious responses.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on calibrating confidence scores or eliciting direct uncertainty estimates from the model. However, these methods may not fully capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty in complex scenarios. By deliberately introducing contrasting information or perspectives, we can amplify the model's inherent uncertainties and force a more nuanced expression of confidence. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to generate a more accurate representation of its uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Uncertainty Amplification (CUA), a prompting technique that strategically presents the model with contrasting information or viewpoints to heighten its expression of uncertainty. The CUA prompt includes three main components: 1) The original query, 2) A 'contrast set' of related information that partially supports and partially contradicts potential answers, and 3) Instructions for the model to analyze the contrasts and express its uncertainty in light of the conflicting information. CUA also incorporates a 'resolution attempt' phase where the model tries to reconcile the contrasts, followed by a final 'amplified uncertainty' statement that captures the nuanced confidence level considering all presented information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of existing datasets and create a new dataset specifically for this task. Existing datasets include: TruthfulQA for factual questions, AmbigQA for ambiguous questions, and ConflictingStatementsQA (a new dataset we'll create). For ConflictingStatementsQA, we'll generate 1000 question-answer pairs with deliberately conflicting information from various domains (science, history, current events, etc.).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Calibrated confidence scoring (using temperature scaling), 3) Direct uncertainty elicitation (asking the model to rate its confidence).",
            "Step 3: CUA Prompt Construction": "Develop a template for the CUA prompt with the following structure: 'Question: {original_query}\nContrasting Information:\n1. {supporting_info_1}\n2. {contradicting_info_1}\n3. {supporting_info_2}\n4. {contradicting_info_2}\nInstructions: Analyze the question and the contrasting information. Attempt to resolve the conflicts and provide your best answer. Then, express your final level of certainty in your answer, considering all the information provided.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run baseline methods, 2) Apply CUA prompting, 3) Collect model outputs, including answers and uncertainty expressions.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Answer accuracy (where applicable), 2) Uncertainty calibration error (UCE), 3) Brier score, 4) Qualitative analysis of uncertainty expressions.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (100 samples per method) to rate the appropriateness of uncertainty expressions. Use a 5-point Likert scale for rating.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare CUA results against baselines across all metrics. Analyze how CUA affects uncertainty expression in different types of questions (factual, ambiguous, conflicting). Examine cases where CUA significantly improves or potentially degrades performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who invented the telephone?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: Who invented the telephone?\nContrasting Information:\n1. Alexander Graham Bell patented the first practical telephone in 1876.\n2. Antonio Meucci demonstrated a working electric telephone in 1849.\n3. Bell's patent for the telephone was issued on March 7, 1876.\n4. Elisha Gray filed a patent caveat for a telephone on the same day as Bell.\nInstructions: Analyze the question and the contrasting information. Attempt to resolve the conflicts and provide your best answer. Then, express your final level of certainty in your answer, considering all the information provided.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Based on the contrasting information provided, the invention of the telephone is a topic with some historical debate and complexity. While Alexander Graham Bell is most commonly credited with inventing the telephone, having patented the first practical telephone in 1876, there are other significant contributors to consider.\n\nAntonio Meucci demonstrated a working electric telephone in 1849, which predates Bell's work by several decades. This suggests that the concept and some form of the technology existed before Bell's patent. Additionally, Elisha Gray filed a patent caveat for a telephone on the same day as Bell, which adds to the complexity of determining a single inventor.\n\nConsidering all this information, my best answer would be that while Alexander Graham Bell is most widely recognized as the inventor of the telephone due to his 1876 patent of the first practical telephone, the invention of the telephone was a process with multiple contributors over time.\n\nUncertainty statement: I am moderately certain about this answer. While Bell's contribution is well-documented and widely accepted, the existence of earlier work by Meucci and the simultaneous filing by Gray introduce significant uncertainty about declaring a single inventor. The invention of the telephone appears to be a case where multiple individuals made important contributions, making it difficult to attribute the invention to a single person with high certainty.",
            "Explanation": "The CUA method prompts the model to consider conflicting information, leading to a more nuanced and uncertain response compared to the baseline method. The model acknowledges the complexity of the invention process and expresses moderate certainty, which is more appropriate given the conflicting historical information."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CUA method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Analyzing the generated contrast sets to ensure they provide relevant and truly conflicting information. 2) Experimenting with different prompt structures for CUA, such as varying the number of contrasting points or changing the instruction phrasing. 3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from CUA than others. 4) Exploring a hybrid approach that combines CUA with calibrated confidence scoring to see if this yields better results. If these investigations don't lead to improvements, we could pivot the project to focus on analyzing why LLMs struggle with uncertainty expression even when presented with conflicting information, potentially uncovering insights about their reasoning processes and limitations."
