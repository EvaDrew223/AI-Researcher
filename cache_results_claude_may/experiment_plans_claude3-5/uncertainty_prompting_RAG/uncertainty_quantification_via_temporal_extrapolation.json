        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to account for the temporal validity of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in responses about time-sensitive topics.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches treat all model knowledge as equally current and valid.",
        "Motivation": "The certainty of knowledge often decays over time, especially in rapidly evolving fields. Modeling this temporal dimension could lead to more accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Uncertainty Projection (TUP). Given a query, TUP prompts the LLM to: 1) Estimate the time period its relevant knowledge comes from. 2) Project how this knowledge might change over time (e.g., \"How might the answer to this question be different in 5 years?\"). 3) Assess the rate of change in the relevant field. 4) Use these temporal projections to adjust its confidence, decreasing confidence for rapidly changing topics or when relying on potentially outdated information. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to reason explicitly about the temporal validity of its knowledge.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test TUP on a curated dataset of time-sensitive questions across various domains (e.g., technology, current events, science). Compare against standard confidence estimation methods, evaluating both immediate accuracy and robustness of confidence estimates over simulated time passages."

        "Title": "Temporal Uncertainty Projection: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Time-Aware Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for the temporal validity of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in responses about time-sensitive topics. This results in potentially inaccurate or outdated information being presented with high confidence, which can mislead users and reduce the overall reliability of the model.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically treat all model knowledge as equally current and valid, ignoring the fact that the certainty of knowledge often decays over time, especially in rapidly evolving fields. By modeling this temporal dimension, we can potentially lead to more accurate uncertainty estimates and better-calibrated confidence scores. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we naturally consider the recency and potential obsolescence of our knowledge when assessing our confidence in a given topic.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Uncertainty Projection (TUP), a novel prompting method designed to encourage LLMs to reason explicitly about the temporal validity of their knowledge. Given a query, TUP prompts the LLM to: 1) Estimate the time period its relevant knowledge comes from. 2) Project how this knowledge might change over time. 3) Assess the rate of change in the relevant field. 4) Use these temporal projections to adjust its confidence, decreasing confidence for rapidly changing topics or when relying on potentially outdated information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a curated dataset of time-sensitive questions across various domains (e.g., technology, current events, science). Each question should be annotated with: a) The correct answer as of the current date. b) The rate of change for the topic (e.g., slow, medium, fast). c) The last major change in the answer, if applicable.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation methods: a) Direct prompting: Ask the question and request a confidence score. b) Calibrated softmax: Use the softmax output of the model as a proxy for confidence. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: Use dropout at inference time to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: TUP Implementation": "Implement the TUP method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation. b) Temporal context estimation. c) Change projection. d) Rate of change assessment. e) Confidence adjustment.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their confidence scores. b) Apply TUP and record the adjusted confidence score. c) Record the model's answers for both baselines and TUP.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: a) Calibration error: Compare the confidence scores with actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Temporal correlation: Assess how well the confidence aligns with the annotated rate of change.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis: a) Compare TUP performance against baselines. b) Analyze performance across different domains and rates of change. c) Examine cases where TUP significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the current CEO of Apple? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The current CEO of Apple is Tim Cook. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUP Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the current CEO of Apple?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUP Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The current CEO of Apple is Tim Cook.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUP Step 2: Temporal Context)": "When did you last update your knowledge about the CEO of Apple? Provide an approximate date or time period.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUP Step 2: Temporal Context)": "My knowledge about the CEO of Apple was last updated around September 2022, which was during the annual Apple product launch event.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUP Step 3: Change Projection)": "How might the answer to 'Who is the current CEO of Apple?' change in the next 1-5 years?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUP Step 3: Change Projection)": "While it's possible that Tim Cook could step down or be replaced as CEO of Apple in the next 1-5 years, there are currently no publicly announced plans for his departure. However, leadership changes in major companies can sometimes occur unexpectedly.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUP Step 4: Rate of Change Assessment)": "How frequently does the CEO of Apple typically change? Provide a rate: slow (years), medium (months), or fast (weeks/days).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUP Step 4: Rate of Change Assessment)": "The rate of change for the CEO of Apple is typically slow (years). Apple has had only three CEOs in its entire history: Steve Jobs (1997-2011), Tim Cook (2011-present), and a brief period with John Sculley (1983-1993).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUP Step 5: Confidence Adjustment)": "Given your initial answer that Tim Cook is the current CEO of Apple, and considering the temporal context, potential changes, and rate of change you've assessed, provide an adjusted confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUP Step 5: Confidence Adjustment)": "Adjusted confidence score: 85. While I'm fairly confident that Tim Cook is still the CEO of Apple, my knowledge is not completely up-to-date, and there's always a possibility of recent changes that I'm not aware of.",
            "Explanation": "The TUP method provides a more nuanced confidence score by considering the temporal aspects of the knowledge. The baseline method gives a high confidence score of 95, potentially overestimating the certainty of the information. In contrast, TUP adjusts the confidence down to 85, accounting for the time since the last knowledge update and the possibility of changes, resulting in a more calibrated confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TUP method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why TUP fails, which could lead to insights about the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Second, we could explore combining TUP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble methods or calibrated regression, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Third, we could shift focus to analyzing how different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. predictive) affect the model's temporal reasoning abilities. Lastly, we could investigate whether TUP can be used as a data augmentation technique for fine-tuning LLMs to be more temporally aware, turning this into a model improvement project rather than just a prompting technique."
