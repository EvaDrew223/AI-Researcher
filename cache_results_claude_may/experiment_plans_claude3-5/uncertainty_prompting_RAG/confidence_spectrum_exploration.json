    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty across a wide range of confidence levels, particularly for questions requiring nuanced or specialized knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on binary confidence ratings or simplistic scalar confidence scores.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express confidence using rich, context-dependent language that captures subtle gradations of certainty. Inspiring LLMs to mimic this behavior could lead to more informative and calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Exploration (CSE), a novel prompting technique that guides LLMs to generate responses across a diverse spectrum of confidence levels. For a given query, we prompt the model to provide multiple answers, each corresponding to a different point on a confidence continuum (e.g., 'absolutely certain', 'fairly confident', 'somewhat unsure', 'highly doubtful', 'completely uncertain'). The prompt includes instructions for the model to adjust its language, reasoning depth, and level of detail for each confidence level. We then analyze the semantic and structural differences between these responses to derive a nuanced uncertainty estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CSE against standard confidence elicitation methods on diverse QA datasets spanning general knowledge, specialized domains, and ambiguous queries. Measure calibration, resolution, and informativeness of uncertainty estimates. Conduct human evaluation to assess the naturalness and interpretability of the confidence-varied responses."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Exploration: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty across a wide range of confidence levels, particularly for questions requiring nuanced or specialized knowledge. Current approaches typically rely on binary confidence ratings or simplistic scalar confidence scores, which fail to capture the rich, context-dependent language that human experts use to express subtle gradations of certainty.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express confidence using rich, context-dependent language that captures subtle gradations of certainty. Inspiring LLMs to mimic this behavior could lead to more informative and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are limited in their ability to capture nuanced levels of confidence. By prompting LLMs to generate responses across a diverse spectrum of confidence levels, we can potentially derive more informative and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Exploration (CSE), a novel prompting technique that guides LLMs to generate responses across a diverse spectrum of confidence levels. For a given query, we prompt the model to provide multiple answers, each corresponding to a different point on a confidence continuum (e.g., 'absolutely certain', 'fairly confident', 'somewhat unsure', 'highly doubtful', 'completely uncertain'). The prompt includes instructions for the model to adjust its language, reasoning depth, and level of detail for each confidence level. We then analyze the semantic and structural differences between these responses to derive a nuanced uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing QA datasets, including: (1) TriviaQA for general knowledge, (2) SciQ for scientific domain, (3) AmbigQA for ambiguous queries. Select 1000 questions from each dataset, ensuring a mix of easy, moderate, and challenging questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct answer generation without explicit confidence, (2) Binary confidence rating (confident/not confident), (3) Scalar confidence score (0-100). For each baseline, create appropriate prompts that instruct the model to generate answers along with the respective confidence measure.",
            "Step 3: CSE Prompt Design": "Design the CSE prompt template. Include instructions for the model to generate responses at five confidence levels: absolutely certain, fairly confident, somewhat unsure, highly doubtful, and completely uncertain. Provide guidelines on how to adjust language, reasoning depth, and detail for each level. Example prompt: 'Answer the following question at five different confidence levels. For each level, adjust your language, reasoning depth, and level of detail accordingly: [1] Absolutely certain: ..., [2] Fairly confident: ..., [3] Somewhat unsure: ..., [4] Highly doubtful: ..., [5] Completely uncertain: ...'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for experiments. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-2 for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Generate Responses": "For each question in the dataset, generate responses using: (1) all baseline methods, (2) the CSE method. Store all generated responses, including intermediate steps and confidence levels.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Calibration: Compare model's expressed confidence with actual accuracy. (2) Resolution: Measure the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers across confidence levels. (3) Informativeness: Assess the amount of unique information provided across confidence levels. (4) Semantic Coherence: Evaluate the consistency of information across confidence levels.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (100 questions) to assess the naturalness and interpretability of the confidence-varied responses. Use a 5-point Likert scale for ratings.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform statistical analysis to compare CSE against baselines. Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the CSE method (e.g., number of confidence levels, prompt design).",
            "Step 9: Visualization": "Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution of confidence levels, the relationship between expressed confidence and accuracy, and the semantic differences between responses at different confidence levels."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Binary Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer along with a confidence rating (confident/not confident).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Binary Confidence)": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: Confident",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Scalar Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer along with a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Scalar Confidence)": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence Score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSE)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Answer this question at five different confidence levels. For each level, adjust your language, reasoning depth, and level of detail accordingly: [1] Absolutely certain: ..., [2] Fairly confident: ..., [3] Somewhat unsure: ..., [4] Highly doubtful: ..., [5] Completely uncertain: ...",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSE)": "[1] Absolutely certain: The capital of France is Paris. This is a well-established fact that has remained unchanged for centuries. Paris has been the political, cultural, and economic center of France since the Middle Ages. [2] Fairly confident: I believe the capital of France is Paris. It's a major European city known for its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, which are often associated with the French capital. [3] Somewhat unsure: I think the capital of France might be Paris, but I'm not entirely sure. It's a very famous French city, but there could be other important cities in France that I'm not considering. [4] Highly doubtful: I'm really not sure about the capital of France. It could be Paris, but it might also be another major city like Lyon or Marseille. I'd need to verify this information before making any claims. [5] Completely uncertain: I'm afraid I don't have any reliable information about the capital of France. It could be any major French city, and I wouldn't want to guess without proper research.",
            "Explanation": "The CSE method provides a more nuanced and informative range of responses compared to the baselines. It captures varying levels of certainty, adjusts the language and detail accordingly, and reveals the model's reasoning process at each confidence level. This allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the model's uncertainty and knowledge depth."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CSE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration or informativeness, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how language models express uncertainty across different domains and question types. This could involve examining linguistic patterns, reasoning strategies, and knowledge gaps at various confidence levels. 2) Investigate the relationship between the model's expressed confidence and its internal representation (e.g., through analysis of attention patterns or logits). This could provide insights into the model's decision-making process and uncertainty estimation. 3) Explore how different prompting strategies affect the model's confidence expression. This could include comparing CSE with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency methods. 4) Develop a meta-model that learns to aggregate and calibrate responses from multiple confidence levels, potentially improving overall uncertainty estimation. These alternative directions would still contribute valuable insights to the field of uncertainty quantification in large language models, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
