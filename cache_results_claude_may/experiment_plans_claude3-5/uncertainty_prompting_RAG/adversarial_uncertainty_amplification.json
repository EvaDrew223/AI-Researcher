        "Problem": "LLMs often express overconfidence, particularly in areas where they have incomplete or potentially flawed knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods typically rely on the model's own direct assessment or statistical properties of its outputs.",

        "Title": "Adversarial Uncertainty Amplification: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often express overconfidence, particularly in areas where they have incomplete or potentially flawed knowledge. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods typically rely on the model's own direct assessment or statistical properties of its outputs, which may not fully capture the model's true uncertainty. By actively challenging the model's knowledge and assumptions through adversarial questioning, we can reveal hidden uncertainties and improve calibration, similar to how human experts refine their confidence through debate and critical questioning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Uncertainty Amplification (AUA), a multi-step process to refine LLM uncertainty estimates: 1) Initial Response: Obtain the model's answer and confidence estimate for a given question. 2) Adversarial Persona Generation: Prompt the model to create multiple 'expert adversary' personas with different backgrounds and viewpoints. 3) Adversarial Questioning: For each adversarial persona, generate a series of probing questions or challenges to the initial response. 4) Response and Reflection: Have the model respond to each challenge, then reflect on how this affects its confidence. 5) Uncertainty Refinement: Synthesize the outcomes of the adversarial process to produce a refined, typically amplified uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse dataset of questions from domains like science, history, and current events. Include a mix of factual questions, questions with subtle inaccuracies, and controversial topics. Use existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, MMLU, and a subset of questions from GPT-TruthfulQA.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation techniques: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use multiple model completions and calculate variance. 3) Temperature scaling: Vary the temperature parameter and observe output distribution.",
            "Step 3: AUA Implementation": "Implement the AUA method: a) Initial response prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' b) Adversarial persona generation prompt: 'Generate 3 expert personas who might challenge the answer to: [QUESTION]' c) Adversarial questioning prompt: 'As [PERSONA], generate 2 challenging questions or points that might reduce confidence in the answer: [INITIAL_ANSWER]' d) Response and reflection prompt: 'Respond to this challenge and reflect on how it affects your confidence: [CHALLENGE]' e) Uncertainty refinement prompt: 'Based on the initial confidence and subsequent challenges, provide a final refined confidence score from 0 to 100 for the answer to: [QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, test on open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: 1) Run all baseline methods and record their uncertainty estimates. 2) Run the AUA method and record the initial and final uncertainty estimates. 3) Store all intermediate outputs (personas, challenges, responses) for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "1) Calibration: Compare the calibration of baseline methods vs. AUA using reliability diagrams and expected calibration error (ECE). 2) Accuracy: Assess whether increased uncertainty correlates with incorrect answers. 3) Uncertainty Amplification: Measure the average change in confidence scores before and after AUA. 4) Qualitative Analysis: Manually review a subset of examples to understand the nature of challenges and how they affect confidence.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Reporting": "1) Generate plots comparing calibration across methods. 2) Conduct statistical tests to determine if AUA significantly improves calibration. 3) Analyze patterns in which types of questions see the most uncertainty amplification. 4) Examine correlations between number/quality of challenges and uncertainty change."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Adversarial Persona Generation)": "Generate 3 expert personas who might challenge the answer to: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Adversarial Persona Generation)": "1. Conspiracy Theorist: Believes the moon landing was faked.\n2. Soviet Space Historian: Expert in the Soviet space program and its achievements.\n3. Lunar Mission Archivist: Specializes in the detailed timeline of Apollo missions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Adversarial Questioning)": "As a Conspiracy Theorist, generate 2 challenging questions or points that might reduce confidence in the answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Adversarial Questioning)": "1. How can we be sure the footage wasn't filmed on a sound stage, given the technology available at the time?\n2. Why haven't we been able to see the flag or lander with modern telescopes if they're really on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Response and Reflection)": "Respond to this challenge and reflect on how it affects your confidence: How can we be sure the footage wasn't filmed on a sound stage, given the technology available at the time?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Response and Reflection)": "Response: While it's true that special effects were advancing in the 1960s, the technology to fake the moon landing footage convincingly did not exist. The lunar environment's unique lighting, lack of atmosphere, and one-sixth gravity would have been impossible to replicate accurately on Earth. Moreover, the mission was independently verified by multiple countries, including the Soviet Union, who would have had every reason to expose a hoax.\n\nReflection: This challenge doesn't significantly affect my confidence. The overwhelming scientific consensus and multiple lines of evidence support the reality of the moon landing. However, it does remind me that there are people who question this historical event, which slightly reduces my confidence. New confidence score: 92",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Uncertainty Refinement)": "Based on the initial confidence and subsequent challenges, provide a final refined confidence score from 0 to 100 for the answer to: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Uncertainty Refinement)": "Final refined confidence score: 90\n\nExplanation: While the historical evidence strongly supports Neil Armstrong as the first person to walk on the moon, the challenges raised highlight that there is a small degree of uncertainty and controversy surrounding this event. The existence of alternative viewpoints and the inability to directly observe the event in the present day contribute to a slight reduction in confidence from the initial assessment.",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how AUA can lead to a more nuanced and slightly reduced confidence estimate. The initial high confidence is challenged through adversarial questioning, leading to a small but meaningful reduction in the final confidence score. This process helps to capture uncertainties that might not be apparent in a simple direct confidence estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed AUA method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated adversarial questions to understand what types of challenges are most effective at revealing model uncertainty. This could lead to insights on LLM knowledge gaps and potential improvements in prompt engineering. 2) Investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could inform targeted applications of AUA. 3) Explore variations of the AUA process, such as using different numbers of adversarial personas or incorporating external knowledge sources in the challenges. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where AUA fails to improve calibration, which could reveal limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about their own knowledge boundaries. 5) Compare the AUA-generated challenges with human-generated challenges to assess the method's effectiveness in mimicking human critical thinking. These analyses could transform the project into a comprehensive study on LLM self-evaluation capabilities and limitations."
