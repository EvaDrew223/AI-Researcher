    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often provide a single, undifferentiated confidence score, failing to distinguish between different sources of uncertainty (e.g., ambiguity in the question, limitations of knowledge, reasoning uncertainty).",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods focus on producing a single confidence score or probability, without breaking down the sources of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing uncertainty into its constituent parts, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence and potentially identify specific areas for improvement or clarification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (UDP): 1) Given a query and initial answer, prompt the model to identify potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., 'What are the main factors that could contribute to uncertainty in this answer?'). 2) For each identified factor, prompt the model to estimate its contribution to overall uncertainty (e.g., 'On a scale of 0-100, how much does [factor] contribute to your uncertainty?'). 3) Prompt the model to explain each uncertainty factor and its estimated impact. 4) Finally, synthesize these components into an overall confidence estimate and explanation (e.g., 'Based on these factors, what is your overall confidence, and why?'). This method provides a structured way to break down and quantify different aspects of model uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Apply UDP to a diverse set of question-answering tasks, comparing its performance to standard confidence elicitation methods. Evaluate not only overall calibration but also the quality and consistency of uncertainty decompositions. Analyze patterns in identified uncertainty factors across different types of questions and model sizes. Conduct human evaluation of the usefulness and interpretability of the decomposed uncertainty explanations."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting: Quantifying and Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide a single, undifferentiated confidence score, failing to distinguish between different sources of uncertainty (e.g., ambiguity in the question, limitations of knowledge, reasoning uncertainty). This lack of granularity in uncertainty estimation limits our understanding of model behavior and hinders effective decision-making based on model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods primarily focus on producing a single confidence score or probability, without breaking down the sources of uncertainty. By decomposing uncertainty into its constituent parts, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence and potentially identify specific areas for improvement or clarification. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often reflect on the reasons behind our uncertainty when making decisions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (UDP), a multi-step prompting approach to break down and quantify different aspects of model uncertainty: 1) Given a query and initial answer, prompt the model to identify potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., 'What are the main factors that could contribute to uncertainty in this answer?'). 2) For each identified factor, prompt the model to estimate its contribution to overall uncertainty (e.g., 'On a scale of 0-100, how much does [factor] contribute to your uncertainty?'). 3) Prompt the model to explain each uncertainty factor and its estimated impact. 4) Finally, synthesize these components into an overall confidence estimate and explanation (e.g., 'Based on these factors, what is your overall confidence, and why?').",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate UDP: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of domains and reasoning types, allowing us to assess the generalizability of UDP.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard confidence estimation: directly ask the model to provide a confidence score for its answer. 2) Calibrated prediction: use temperature scaling to calibrate the model's output probabilities.",
            "Step 3: UDP Implementation": "Implement the four-step UDP process: a) Uncertainty factor identification, b) Factor quantification, c) Factor explanation, d) Synthesis and overall confidence estimation. For each step, create prompts that guide the model through the process.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. 2) Uncertainty decomposition quality: human evaluation of the relevance and coherence of identified uncertainty factors. 3) Explanation quality: human evaluation of the clarity and informativeness of uncertainty explanations. 4) Task performance: measure if UDP improves the model's accuracy on the underlying tasks.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run UDP. c) Collect model outputs, including answers, confidence scores, and uncertainty decompositions. d) Calculate evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare UDP performance against baselines. Analyze patterns in identified uncertainty factors across different types of questions and model sizes. Conduct qualitative analysis of uncertainty decompositions and explanations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 1: Uncertainty Factor Identification)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. What are the main factors that could contribute to uncertainty in this answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 1: Uncertainty Factor Identification)": "1. Historical changes: Capitals can change over time.\n2. Definition of 'capital': There could be multiple types of capitals (e.g., political, economic).\n3. Personal knowledge limitations: My information could be outdated or incorrect.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 2: Factor Quantification)": "For each identified factor, estimate its contribution to overall uncertainty on a scale of 0-100:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 2: Factor Quantification)": "1. Historical changes: 5/100\n2. Definition of 'capital': 10/100\n3. Personal knowledge limitations: 2/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 3: Factor Explanation)": "Explain each uncertainty factor and its estimated impact:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 3: Factor Explanation)": "1. Historical changes (5/100): While capitals can change, Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, so this factor contributes minimal uncertainty.\n2. Definition of 'capital' (10/100): There could be some ambiguity about whether we mean the political, economic, or cultural capital. However, Paris is generally considered the primary capital in all these aspects, so this contributes moderate uncertainty.\n3. Personal knowledge limitations (2/100): As an AI, my knowledge comes from training data, which could theoretically be outdated. However, this is a well-known fact that's unlikely to have changed, so this contributes very little uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 4: Synthesis and Overall Confidence)": "Based on these factors, what is your overall confidence in the answer 'Paris is the capital of France', and why?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 4: Synthesis and Overall Confidence)": "Overall confidence: 95/100. The high confidence is due to the fact that Paris has been the well-established capital of France for centuries, and it's considered the capital in political, economic, and cultural terms. The main sources of uncertainty are the potential for different interpretations of 'capital' and the small possibility of outdated information, but these are minor concerns given the stability and prominence of Paris as France's capital.",
            "explanation": "UDP provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the model's confidence compared to the baseline. It breaks down the sources of uncertainty, quantifies them, and provides explanations, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of the model's reasoning and potential areas of improvement."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UDP doesn't significantly improve over baselines in terms of calibration or task performance, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the patterns and quality of uncertainty decompositions across different types of questions and models. This could yield insights into how models reason about their own uncertainty, potentially informing future model development or prompting strategies. We could also investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from UDP than others, which could lead to targeted applications of the method. Additionally, we could explore combining UDP with other techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting, to see if this hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of cases where UDP performs poorly, which might reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability to reason about their own uncertainty, providing valuable insights for future research directions."
