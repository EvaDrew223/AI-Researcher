        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge gaps and uncertainties, leading to unreliable confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or external calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By inverting the typical question-answering scenario and asking the model to generate questions it's uncertain about, we can potentially uncover more accurate representations of its uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Scenario Inversion (MSI), a novel prompting technique: 1) Given a topic or domain, prompt the model to generate a set of questions it feels uncertain about answering. 2) For each generated question, ask the model to provide an explanation of why it's uncertain. 3) Prompt the model to answer its own uncertain questions and provide confidence scores. 4) Compare the model's expressed uncertainty in step 2 with its confidence in step 3 to identify discrepancies. 5) Use these discrepancies to calibrate a final uncertainty estimate for the original topic or domain. This method leverages the model's metacognitive abilities to reveal uncertainties it might not express in standard question-answering scenarios.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test MSI across various knowledge domains, comparing its uncertainty estimates with those from standard confidence elicitation methods. Evaluate using calibration metrics and correlations with external measures of topic difficulty or knowledge sparsity in the training data."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Scenario Inversion: Unveiling LLM Uncertainties through Self-Generated Questions",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge gaps and uncertainties, leading to unreliable confidence estimates. This issue can result in overconfident responses in areas where the model's knowledge is limited or uncertain, potentially misleading users and reducing the overall reliability of the system.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to quantifying LLM uncertainty typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or external calibration techniques. However, these methods may not fully capture the nuanced uncertainties present in the model's knowledge. By inverting the typical question-answering scenario and asking the model to generate questions it's uncertain about, we can potentially uncover more accurate representations of its uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's metacognitive abilities, allowing it to reveal uncertainties it might not express in standard question-answering scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Scenario Inversion (MSI), a novel prompting technique that consists of five main steps: 1) Given a topic or domain, prompt the model to generate a set of questions it feels uncertain about answering. 2) For each generated question, ask the model to provide an explanation of why it's uncertain. 3) Prompt the model to answer its own uncertain questions and provide confidence scores. 4) Compare the model's expressed uncertainty in step 2 with its confidence in step 3 to identify discrepancies. 5) Use these discrepancies to calibrate a final uncertainty estimate for the original topic or domain.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse range of topics from existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, SciQ, and TriviaQA. Create a balanced set of 100 topics, ensuring a mix of general knowledge, scientific concepts, and current events.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods for comparison: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Ask the model to provide a confidence score (0-100) for each answer. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 1.5) during generation and analyze the output distribution.",
            "Step 3: MSI Implementation": "For each topic, implement the following steps: a) Generate uncertain questions: 'Given the topic [TOPIC], generate 5 questions you're uncertain about answering.' b) Explain uncertainties: 'For each question, explain why you're uncertain about answering it.' c) Answer questions: 'Now, try to answer each question and provide a confidence score (0-100) for your answer.' d) Analyze discrepancies: Compare the explanations of uncertainty with the provided answers and confidence scores. e) Calibrate uncertainty: Use the discrepancies to adjust the final uncertainty estimate for the topic.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments. Additionally, include Claude from Anthropic as a third model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Calibration error: Compare model confidence with actual performance. 2) Spearman rank correlation: Between model uncertainty and human-rated question difficulty. 3) Uncertainty-performance correlation: Measure how well uncertainty estimates predict model performance.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3 domain experts to rate the quality and relevance of generated uncertain questions, and the accuracy of answers provided by the model.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare MSI results with baseline methods across all metrics. Analyze patterns in generated uncertain questions and explanations. Investigate how well MSI captures known limitations of LLMs."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98"
            },
            "MSI Example": {
                "Step 1 Input": "Given the topic 'French History', generate 5 questions you're uncertain about answering.",
                "Step 1 Output": "1. What was the exact date of the Tennis Court Oath during the French Revolution?\n2. Who was the last Merovingian king of France?\n3. What were the specific terms of the Treaty of Troyes in 1420?\n4. How many people exactly were guillotined during the Reign of Terror?\n5. What was the primary cause of the War of the League of Cambrai?",
                "Step 2 Input": "For each question, explain why you're uncertain about answering it.",
                "Step 2 Output": "1. The exact date of the Tennis Court Oath: While I know it occurred in June 1789, I'm uncertain about the specific day. Historical dates can be tricky to recall with precision.\n2. The last Merovingian king: The Merovingian dynasty ended in the 8th century, and I'm not confident in naming the last king without the risk of confusing it with other Frankish dynasties.\n3. Specific terms of the Treaty of Troyes: While I know this treaty was significant in the Hundred Years' War, I'm uncertain about its exact provisions.\n4. Exact number guillotined during the Reign of Terror: Historical estimates vary, and I'm not confident in providing an exact figure without the risk of inaccuracy.\n5. Primary cause of the War of the League of Cambrai: This war involved complex political alliances, and I'm uncertain about singling out one primary cause among multiple factors.",
                "Step 3 Input": "Now, try to answer each question and provide a confidence score (0-100) for your answer.",
                "Step 3 Output": "1. The Tennis Court Oath took place on June 20, 1789. Confidence: 85\n2. The last Merovingian king was Childeric III. Confidence: 70\n3. The Treaty of Troyes in 1420 recognized Henry V of England as heir to the French throne. Confidence: 80\n4. Approximately 16,000 people were guillotined during the Reign of Terror. Confidence: 60\n5. The primary cause of the War of the League of Cambrai was to curb the power of the Republic of Venice. Confidence: 75",
                "Step 4 (Analysis)": "Discrepancies observed: For question 1, the model expressed uncertainty about the exact date but provided an answer with high confidence. For question 4, the model acknowledged the difficulty in providing an exact number but still gave a specific figure with moderate confidence.",
                "Step 5 (Calibration)": "Based on the discrepancies, we might adjust the uncertainty estimate for the 'French History' topic. The model seems to have some knowledge but also shows signs of overconfidence in specific details. A calibrated uncertainty score for this topic might be around 30-40 on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely certain and 100 is completely uncertain."
            },
            "Explanation": "The MSI method reveals more nuanced uncertainties compared to direct confidence elicitation. It exposes specific areas where the model lacks confidence and allows for a more detailed analysis of the model's knowledge gaps. The process of generating questions, explaining uncertainties, and then attempting to answer helps identify instances of potential overconfidence or misalignment between expressed uncertainty and actual knowledge."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MSI method doesn't yield significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of the generated uncertain questions to gain insights into the types of knowledge gaps LLMs typically have. This could inform future research on model training and knowledge acquisition. Second, we could investigate whether the process of generating uncertain questions improves the model's performance on subsequent related tasks, exploring potential meta-learning effects. Third, we could expand the study to compare MSI results across different model sizes and architectures, potentially uncovering patterns in how uncertainty manifests as models scale. Lastly, we could explore combining MSI with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or Bayesian neural networks, to create a more robust hybrid approach to uncertainty estimation in LLMs."
