        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often rely on single-pass evaluations, missing potential inconsistencies or edge cases in model knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically involve direct prompting for confidence or analyzing output probabilities.",
        "Motivation": "By presenting contrastive scenarios or slightly modified questions, we can probe the boundaries of an LLM's knowledge and reveal more nuanced uncertainty information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation (CUE), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Initial Response: Obtain the model's answer and confidence for the original question. 2) Contrastive Generation: Automatically generate a set of related questions that probe similar but distinct aspects of the topic. 3) Boundary Exploration: Present these contrastive questions to the model, collecting answers and confidences. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Analyze the pattern of confidences and consistency across the original and contrastive questions to produce a refined uncertainty estimate that captures both local and global uncertainty.",

        "Title": "Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation: Probing the Boundaries of LLM Knowledge for Refined Uncertainty Estimation",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-pass evaluations, which can miss potential inconsistencies or edge cases in model knowledge. This leads to unreliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in scenarios where the model's knowledge boundaries are unclear or when dealing with complex, multi-faceted questions.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically involve direct prompting for confidence or analyzing output probabilities, which may not capture the nuanced nature of model uncertainty. By presenting contrastive scenarios or slightly modified questions, we can probe the boundaries of an LLM's knowledge and reveal more nuanced uncertainty information. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often assess our confidence by considering related scenarios or alternative formulations of a problem.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation (CUE), a multi-step prompting technique:\n1) Initial Response: Obtain the model's answer and confidence for the original question.\n2) Contrastive Generation: Automatically generate a set of related questions that probe similar but distinct aspects of the topic.\n3) Boundary Exploration: Present these contrastive questions to the model, collecting answers and confidences.\n4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Analyze the pattern of confidences and consistency across the original and contrastive questions to produce a refined uncertainty estimate that captures both local and global uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset, which contains questions designed to test the truthfulness and uncertainty of language models. We will also use a subset of the Natural Questions dataset for open-domain question answering tasks.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\na) Direct confidence estimation: Append \"How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?\" to each question.\nb) Softmax temperature scaling: Use the model's output logits and apply temperature scaling to obtain calibrated probabilities.",
            "Step 4: CUE Implementation": "Implement the CUE method:\na) Initial Response: For each question, get the model's answer and confidence using the direct confidence estimation prompt.\nb) Contrastive Generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 related questions that probe different aspects of the original question. Example prompt: \"Generate 3-5 related questions that explore different aspects or potential edge cases of the following question: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION]\"\nc) Boundary Exploration: For each generated contrastive question, obtain the model's answer and confidence.\nd) Uncertainty Synthesis: Develop an algorithm to synthesize the uncertainty estimate based on the original and contrastive responses. This could involve calculating the variance in confidences, detecting inconsistencies in answers, and weighting the importance of each contrastive question.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CUE against the baselines using the following metrics:\na) Calibration error: Compare the predicted confidence with the actual accuracy.\nb) Sharpness: Measure the concentration of the uncertainty estimates.\nc) Robustness: Assess how well the uncertainty estimates generalize to slight variations in the questions.\nd) Correlation with human judgments: Use a small subset of questions where human experts have rated their confidence, and compare the model's uncertainty estimates with these human judgments.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis of the results:\na) Compare CUE performance across different question types and domains.\nb) Analyze cases where CUE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\nc) Investigate the relationship between the number and type of contrastive questions and the quality of uncertainty estimates.\nd) Examine how different synthesis algorithms affect the final uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUE; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUE; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUE; Step 2: Contrastive Generation)": "Generate 3-5 related questions that explore different aspects or potential edge cases of the following question: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUE; Step 2: Contrastive Generation)": "1. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n2. Was there any controversy or debate about who should be the first to step on the moon?\n3. How many people in total have walked on the moon?\n4. What was the name of the Apollo mission that first landed humans on the moon?\n5. Were there any backup plans in case Neil Armstrong was unable to make the first moonwalk?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUE; Step 3: Boundary Exploration)": "Q: Who was the second person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUE; Step 3: Boundary Exploration)": "A: The second person to walk on the moon was Buzz Aldrin. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUE; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the following responses, provide a refined uncertainty estimate for the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?':\nOriginal Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nA: Neil Armstrong (Confidence: 98)\nContrastive Q1: Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\nA: Buzz Aldrin (Confidence: 95)\nContrastive Q2: How many people in total have walked on the moon?\nA: 12 people (Confidence: 90)\nContrastive Q3: What was the name of the Apollo mission that first landed humans on the moon?\nA: Apollo 11 (Confidence: 97)\nProvide the refined uncertainty estimate as a number between 0 and 100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is completely certain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUE; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Refined uncertainty estimate: 96\nExplanation: The high confidence in the original answer (98) is supported by consistent and high confidence answers to related questions. The slight decrease in the refined estimate accounts for the small variations in confidence across the contrastive questions, which suggest a very slight uncertainty about some details of the moon landings.",
            "explanation": "CUE provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by considering related questions that probe the boundaries of the model's knowledge. This approach can potentially capture uncertainties that might not be apparent from a single confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CUE method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the generated contrastive questions to understand what types of questions are most effective at revealing model uncertainty. This could lead to insights about the structure of LLM knowledge and inform future uncertainty estimation techniques.\n2. Investigate different algorithms for synthesizing the uncertainty estimates from the contrastive responses. We could explore machine learning approaches that learn to weight different aspects of the responses to produce more accurate uncertainty estimates.\n3. Extend the project to focus on improving the generation of contrastive questions. We could develop techniques to generate more diverse and probing questions, potentially using reinforcement learning to optimize for questions that best reveal model uncertainty.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand in which types of questions or domains CUE performs well or poorly. This could lead to a hybrid approach that combines CUE with other uncertainty estimation techniques depending on the question type.\n5. Explore how CUE performs across different model sizes and architectures. This analysis could provide insights into how model scale and architecture affect uncertainty estimation and knowledge boundaries."
