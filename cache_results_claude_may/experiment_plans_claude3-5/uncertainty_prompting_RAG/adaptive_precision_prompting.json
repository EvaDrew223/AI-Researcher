        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to appropriately adjust their level of precision or specificity based on their confidence, leading to overly specific answers in low-confidence situations or vague responses when high confidence is warranted.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on global confidence scores or binary uncertainty flags, without addressing the granularity of the response itself.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from the way humans naturally adjust the specificity of their statements based on confidence levels, we propose a method that dynamically adapts the precision of the model's output.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adaptive Precision Prompting (APP), a technique that iteratively refines the granularity of the model's response based on its confidence. The process involves: 1) Initial Response: Generate a highly general response to the query. 2) Confidence Assessment: Prompt the model to assess its confidence in providing more specific information. 3) Precision Adjustment: Based on the confidence assessment, prompt the model to either increase specificity (if confident) or maintain generality (if uncertain). 4) Iterative Refinement: Repeat steps 2-3 for each component of the response, progressively increasing precision where possible. 5) Uncertainty Tagging: For each statement in the final response, add explicit uncertainty tags (e.g., 'highly certain', 'somewhat uncertain') based on the confidence assessments made during the process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate APP against standard prompting techniques on a range of tasks requiring varying levels of specificity, such as open-ended question answering and summarization. Measure the correlation between expressed confidence and answer specificity, as well as overall accuracy and informativeness of responses."

        "Title": "Adaptive Precision Prompting: Calibrating Confidence and Specificity in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to appropriately adjust their level of precision or specificity based on their confidence, leading to overly specific answers in low-confidence situations or vague responses when high confidence is warranted. This mismatch between confidence and specificity can result in misleading or unhelpful outputs, potentially undermining the reliability and usefulness of LLMs in various applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically focus on global confidence scores or binary uncertainty flags, without addressing the granularity of the response itself. Drawing inspiration from the way humans naturally adjust the specificity of their statements based on confidence levels, we propose a method that dynamically adapts the precision of the model's output. This approach aims to better align the model's expressed confidence with the level of detail in its responses, potentially leading to more reliable and informative outputs across a range of tasks and domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adaptive Precision Prompting (APP), a technique that iteratively refines the granularity of the model's response based on its confidence. The process involves five key steps: 1) Initial Response: Generate a highly general response to the query. 2) Confidence Assessment: Prompt the model to assess its confidence in providing more specific information. 3) Precision Adjustment: Based on the confidence assessment, prompt the model to either increase specificity (if confident) or maintain generality (if uncertain). 4) Iterative Refinement: Repeat steps 2-3 for each component of the response, progressively increasing precision where possible. 5) Uncertainty Tagging: For each statement in the final response, add explicit uncertainty tags (e.g., 'highly certain', 'somewhat uncertain') based on the confidence assessments made during the process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse range of tasks requiring varying levels of specificity, such as open-ended question answering and summarization. We will use the following datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, 2) XSum for summarization, and 3) MMLU for domain-specific knowledge questions.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and 3) Self-consistency prompting.",
            "Step 4: APP Implementation": "Implement the Adaptive Precision Prompting method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial general response generation, b) Confidence assessment prompting, c) Precision adjustment prompting, d) Iterative refinement loop, e) Uncertainty tagging.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Define and implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Accuracy (for tasks with ground truth), 2) Specificity score (using NLP techniques to measure the level of detail), 3) Confidence-specificity correlation (measuring how well the model's expressed confidence aligns with the specificity of its answers), 4) Human evaluation of informativeness and reliability.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and APP. For each dataset and method combination, generate responses for at least 100 randomly selected examples.",
            "Step 7: Result Analysis": "Analyze the results by comparing APP against baseline methods on all defined metrics. Conduct statistical significance tests to validate the improvements.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies by removing or modifying individual components of APP (e.g., removing the iterative refinement step) to understand the contribution of each component.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Conduct a detailed error analysis on a subset of examples where APP performs worse than baselines to identify potential areas for improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France and when was the Eiffel Tower built?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APP; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France and when was the Eiffel Tower built? Please provide a general answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APP; Step 1: Initial Response)": "The capital of France is a major European city, and the Eiffel Tower was built in the late 19th century.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APP; Step 2: Confidence Assessment)": "Assess your confidence in providing more specific information about the capital of France and the construction date of the Eiffel Tower.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APP; Step 2: Confidence Assessment)": "I am highly confident about the capital of France. I am moderately confident about the exact year the Eiffel Tower was built.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APP; Step 3: Precision Adjustment)": "Based on your confidence assessment, provide a more specific answer about the capital of France, and a moderately specific answer about the Eiffel Tower's construction.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APP; Step 3: Precision Adjustment)": "The capital of France is Paris. The Eiffel Tower was built in the late 1880s.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APP; Step 4: Iterative Refinement)": "Can you provide the exact year for the Eiffel Tower's construction? If not, explain your level of certainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APP; Step 4: Iterative Refinement)": "I believe the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889, but I'm not entirely certain. My confidence level for this specific year is moderate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (APP; Step 5: Uncertainty Tagging)": "Please provide the final answer with uncertainty tags for each piece of information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (APP; Step 5: Uncertainty Tagging)": "[Highly certain] The capital of France is Paris. [Moderately certain] The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889.",
            "explanation": "APP allows for a more nuanced response that reflects the model's varying levels of confidence in different parts of the answer. It provides specific information where the model is highly confident (the capital) and less specific information where it's less certain (the exact year of the Eiffel Tower's construction). The final answer includes uncertainty tags, giving users a clear indication of the model's confidence in each piece of information."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed APP method doesn't significantly improve over baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include examining the generated confidence assessments to see if they accurately reflect the model's true confidence, and analyzing whether the precision adjustments are appropriate given the confidence levels. We could also investigate whether the iterative refinement process is effective in improving answer quality or if it introduces new errors. Additionally, we might explore alternative ways of implementing each step of APP, such as using different prompting strategies for confidence assessment or precision adjustment. If these analyses don't yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth study of how LLMs express and reason about their own uncertainty, which could provide valuable insights for future work on improving model calibration and output quality."
