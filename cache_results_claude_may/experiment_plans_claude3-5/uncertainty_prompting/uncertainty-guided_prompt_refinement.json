    "idea_name": "Uncertainty-Guided Prompt Refinement",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often rely on static prompts, which may not adapt well to the varying levels of uncertainty across different inputs and tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Typical approaches include using ensemble methods, Monte Carlo dropout, or directly asking the model to estimate its confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by active learning techniques, we propose that the prompting process itself can be dynamically adjusted based on the model's uncertainty, potentially leading to more accurate and calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Guided Prompt Refinement (UGPR), an iterative prompting method that adapts the prompt based on the model's current uncertainty estimate. The process begins with a base prompt asking for both an answer and a confidence estimate. Then, based on the initial confidence, we generate targeted follow-up prompts. For high uncertainty, we ask the model to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-questions. For medium uncertainty, we prompt the model to consider alternative perspectives or potential pitfalls in its reasoning. For low uncertainty, we challenge the model with potential counterarguments. This process continues for a fixed number of iterations or until the confidence stabilizes. The final confidence estimate is derived from the trajectory of confidence scores across iterations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UGPR against standard confidence estimation methods on diverse tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. We'll use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score to assess calibration, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Guided Prompt Refinement: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often rely on static prompts, which may not adapt well to the varying levels of uncertainty across different inputs and tasks. This leads to poorly calibrated confidence estimates, potentially resulting in unreliable model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like ensemble techniques, Monte Carlo dropout, or direct confidence estimation often fall short in adapting to the diverse nature of inputs and tasks. Inspired by active learning techniques, we propose that the prompting process itself can be dynamically adjusted based on the model's uncertainty. This approach has the potential to lead to more accurate and calibrated confidence estimates by tailoring the prompting strategy to the specific characteristics of each input and the model's current level of certainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Guided Prompt Refinement (UGPR), an iterative prompting method that adapts the prompt based on the model's current uncertainty estimate. The process begins with a base prompt asking for both an answer and a confidence estimate. Then, based on the initial confidence, we generate targeted follow-up prompts. For high uncertainty, we ask the model to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-questions.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets: (1) TriviaQA for factual QA, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving. Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, (2) Ensemble method using 5 different prompts, and (3) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using an open-source model that allows weight modifications).",
            "Step 3: UGPR Implementation": "Implement the UGPR method with the following sub-steps: (a) Initial prompt generation, (b) Confidence estimation, (c) Uncertainty-based prompt refinement, (d) Answer and confidence update, (e) Iteration control.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the main experiments. Also test on open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning": "On the validation set, tune hyperparameters such as the number of iterations, confidence thresholds for different uncertainty levels, and the specific wording of prompts for each uncertainty level.",
            "Step 6: Main Experiments": "Run the baselines and UGPR on the test sets of all three datasets. For each method, collect both the final answers and the confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the methods using the following metrics: (a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (b) Brier Score, (c) Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC), (d) Task-specific accuracy metrics (e.g., exact match for TriviaQA, accuracy for CommonsenseQA, and solution correctness for GSM8K).",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis including: (a) Comparison of calibration curves, (b) Analysis of prompt refinement patterns for different uncertainty levels, (c) Case studies of successful and unsuccessful refinements, (d) Impact of the number of iterations on performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "UGPR Prompt Input (Initial)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "UGPR Prompt Expected Output (Initial)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "UGPR Prompt Input (Refinement for Low Uncertainty)": "Your previous answer was 'The capital of France is Paris' with 95% confidence. To challenge this high-confidence answer, consider potential counterarguments or alternative interpretations. Are there any historical periods or specific contexts where this might not have been true? Provide an updated answer and confidence level.",
            "UGPR Prompt Expected Output (Refinement for Low Uncertainty)": "You're right to challenge my high-confidence answer. While Paris is indeed the current capital of France, there have been periods in history where this wasn't the case. For example, during World War II, when Paris was occupied by Nazi Germany, the capital was temporarily moved to Vichy for the collaborationist government, while the Free French forces considered Algiers as their capital. However, for the vast majority of modern history and in the present day, Paris is unequivocally the capital of France. Given this additional context, I would update my answer to: The current capital of France is Paris, and has been for most of modern history, with brief exceptions during extraordinary circumstances like WWII. Confidence: 99%",
            "Explanation": "The UGPR method prompts the model to consider potential counterarguments for high-confidence answers, leading to a more nuanced and historically accurate response with an even higher confidence level. This demonstrates how UGPR can improve both the quality of the answer and the calibration of the confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UGPR doesn't significantly improve calibration or task performance, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of how different types of prompts affect confidence estimation across various tasks. This could yield insights into the relationship between prompt design and uncertainty quantification. Second, we could investigate the patterns of confidence changes across iterations, which might reveal interesting behaviors of LLMs in reasoning tasks. Third, we could explore combining UGPR with other techniques like ensemble methods or external knowledge retrieval, potentially leading to a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. Lastly, if the iterative nature of UGPR proves challenging, we could simplify the approach to a single-step prompt refinement based on initial confidence, which might still offer improvements over static prompting while being more computationally efficient."
