    "idea_name": "Adversarial Self-Questioning",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, particularly when facing ambiguous or out-of-distribution queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on external knowledge or pre-defined heuristics to gauge model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to actively challenge its own assertions, we can uncover potential weaknesses and uncertainties in its reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Questioning, a multi-turn prompting strategy: 1) Generate an initial response to a query. 2) Prompt the model to act as a skeptical expert, generating probing questions that challenge the initial response. 3) Answer these questions, updating the confidence if necessary. 4) Repeat steps 2-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes. 5) Synthesize a final response and uncertainty estimate based on this adversarial dialogue.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on tasks prone to overconfidence, such as open-ended question answering and ethical reasoning. Compare against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods using metrics like calibration error and AUROC for selective prediction."

        "Title": "Adversarial Self-Questioning: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Iterative Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, particularly when facing ambiguous or out-of-distribution queries. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable or misleading information being presented as factual, potentially causing significant issues in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to quantify uncertainty in LLMs often rely on external knowledge or pre-defined heuristics, which may not capture the full complexity of the model's reasoning process. By prompting the model to actively challenge its own assertions, we can uncover potential weaknesses and uncertainties in its reasoning process, leading to more calibrated confidence estimates. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities for self-reflection and critical thinking, potentially offering a more nuanced and context-aware method of uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Questioning, a multi-turn prompting strategy: 1) Generate an initial response to a query. 2) Prompt the model to act as a skeptical expert, generating probing questions that challenge the initial response. 3) Answer these questions, updating the confidence if necessary. 4) Repeat steps 2-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes. 5) Synthesize a final response and uncertainty estimate based on this adversarial dialogue.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, 2) ETHICS dataset for ethical reasoning, and 3) AmbigQA for ambiguous questions. These datasets cover a range of scenarios where overconfidence is particularly problematic.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly querying the model with the input question. 2) Temperature scaling: using different temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) to generate multiple responses and use their variance as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Adversarial Self-Questioning Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response generation, b) Skeptical question generation, c) Question answering and confidence updating, d) Iteration (repeat b-c for 3 rounds or until confidence stabilizes), e) Final response synthesis.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) AUROC for selective prediction: ability to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions. 3) Spearman correlation between confidence scores and human judgments of answer quality (we'll use a small subset of 100 examples for human evaluation).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. b) Run the Adversarial Self-Questioning method and collect results. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and proposed methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines across different datasets and models. Analyze how the confidence estimates change over iterations in the Adversarial Self-Questioning process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 99%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris. (Initial Confidence: 99%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Skeptical Questions)": "You are a skeptical expert. Generate 3 probing questions that challenge the statement: 'The capital of France is Paris.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Skeptical Questions)": "1. Has the capital of France ever changed throughout history?\n2. Are there any ongoing debates or movements to relocate the capital of France?\n3. Are there any other cities in France that serve important governmental functions that might be considered co-capitals?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Answering Questions)": "Please answer the following questions:\n1. Has the capital of France ever changed throughout history?\n2. Are there any ongoing debates or movements to relocate the capital of France?\n3. Are there any other cities in France that serve important governmental functions that might be considered co-capitals?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Answering Questions)": "1. Yes, the capital of France has changed in the past. For example, during World War II, Vichy served as the capital of Vichy France from 1940 to 1944.\n2. There are no significant ongoing debates or movements to relocate the capital of France.\n3. While Paris is the undisputed capital, some other cities do have important governmental functions. For instance, Strasbourg is the official seat of the European Parliament.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Response)": "Based on the initial statement and the answers to the skeptical questions, provide a final response to the question 'What is the capital of France?' Include an updated confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Response)": "The capital of France is Paris. While there have been historical changes (such as Vichy serving as capital during part of World War II) and other cities like Strasbourg have important governmental roles, Paris remains the undisputed capital of France today. There are no significant movements to change this status. (Updated Confidence: 95%)",
            "Explanation": "The Adversarial Self-Questioning process led to a slight decrease in confidence (from 99% to 95%) by uncovering nuances in the historical context and the roles of other cities. This demonstrates how the method can lead to more calibrated confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Adversarial Self-Questioning method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can explore several alternatives. First, we could analyze the generated skeptical questions to understand if they're effectively challenging the model's initial responses. If not, we might need to refine our prompting strategy for generating more probing questions. Second, we could investigate whether the number of iterations affects performance, potentially increasing or decreasing the number of rounds. Third, we could explore combining our method with existing uncertainty quantification techniques, such as ensemble methods or dropout-based approaches, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, if these attempts don't yield improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on understanding why LLMs struggle with self-calibration and what this reveals about their reasoning processes and limitations."
