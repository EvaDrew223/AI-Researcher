    "idea_name": "Confidence Calibration via Linguistic Hedging",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their responses, even when they are incorrect or uncertain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include direct confidence scoring, ensemble methods, and calibration via fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often use linguistic hedges to express uncertainty in natural language. By prompting LLMs to incorporate these hedges, we can potentially achieve more nuanced and accurate confidence calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting strategy: First, we prompt the LLM to generate an answer along with a list of potential linguistic hedges (e.g., 'likely', 'possibly', 'it seems that') ranked by confidence level. Second, we prompt the model to rewrite its answer incorporating the appropriate hedge based on its internal confidence. The prompt includes examples of how different hedges correspond to different confidence levels. We also introduce a 'hedge calibration' step where the model is asked to justify its hedge choice, potentially leading to hedge adjustment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare our method against baseline direct confidence scoring and ensemble methods on datasets like TruthfulQA and MMLU. Evaluate using calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score. Conduct a human evaluation to assess the naturalness and interpretability of the hedged responses."

        "Title": "Linguistic Hedging for Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their responses, even when they are incorrect or uncertain. This overconfidence can lead to misinformation and reduced trust in AI systems. We need a method to better quantify uncertainty and calibrate the confidence of these models in a way that is natural and interpretable to humans.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as direct confidence scoring, ensemble methods, and calibration via fine-tuning, often lack interpretability or require significant computational resources. Human experts frequently use linguistic hedges to express uncertainty in natural language. By prompting LLMs to incorporate these hedges, we can potentially achieve more nuanced and accurate confidence calibration that is both interpretable and computationally efficient.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting strategy for linguistic hedging: 1) First, we prompt the LLM to generate an answer along with a list of potential linguistic hedges (e.g., 'likely', 'possibly', 'it seems that') ranked by confidence level. 2) Second, we prompt the model to rewrite its answer incorporating the appropriate hedge based on its internal confidence. The prompt includes examples of how different hedges correspond to different confidence levels. We also introduce a 'hedge calibration' step where the model is asked to justify its hedge choice, potentially leading to hedge adjustment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset for factual question answering and the MMLU dataset for multi-task language understanding. These datasets cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, allowing us to test the effectiveness of our method across various domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting without uncertainty quantification, 2) Direct confidence scoring where the model is asked to provide a confidence score from 0-100%, and 3) Ensemble method using 5 different seeds for each query and calculating the agreement rate.",
            "Step 3: Hedge List Creation": "Create a comprehensive list of linguistic hedges, ranked by their implied level of certainty. For example: 'I am certain that' (highest certainty), 'It is very likely that', 'It is probable that', 'It seems that', 'It is possible that', 'I am not sure, but it might be that' (lowest certainty).",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each stage of our method: a) Hedge generation prompt: 'Given the question [QUESTION], provide an answer and list 5 linguistic hedges that could be used to express different levels of certainty about this answer, ranked from most certain to least certain.' b) Answer rewriting prompt: 'Rewrite your answer to the question [QUESTION] using the most appropriate hedge from the list you generated, based on your level of confidence in the answer.' c) Hedge calibration prompt: 'Explain why you chose this particular hedge for your answer. If upon reflection you think a different hedge would be more appropriate, please provide the adjusted answer with the new hedge.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in our datasets: 1) Run the baseline methods. 2) Execute our two-stage hedging method. 3) Perform the hedge calibration step. 4) Record all outputs, including intermediate steps (hedge lists, initial answers, rewritten answers, and calibration explanations).",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Compare the correctness of answers across methods. 2) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score to assess how well the expressed uncertainty matches actual correctness. For our method, map hedges to numerical confidence scores for these calculations. 3) Human evaluation: Recruit human judges to rate the naturalness and interpretability of the hedged responses on a Likert scale.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of accuracy and calibration metrics across methods. 2) Analysis of hedge usage patterns and their correlation with answer correctness. 3) Examination of cases where hedge calibration led to adjustments. 4) Correlation between human-rated naturalness and calibration metrics."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Confidence Scoring)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer followed by your confidence level from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Scoring)": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hedge Generation)": "Given the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?', provide an answer and list 5 linguistic hedges that could be used to express different levels of certainty about this answer, ranked from most certain to least certain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hedge Generation)": "Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nHedges:\n1. I am certain that\n2. It is well-established that\n3. To the best of my knowledge,\n4. It is widely believed that\n5. I think it's likely that",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Answer Rewriting)": "Rewrite your answer to the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?' using the most appropriate hedge from the list you generated, based on your level of confidence in the answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Answer Rewriting)": "It is well-established that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hedge Calibration)": "Explain why you chose this particular hedge for your answer. If upon reflection you think a different hedge would be more appropriate, please provide the adjusted answer with the new hedge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hedge Calibration)": "I chose 'It is well-established that' because this is a widely known historical fact that has been extensively documented and verified. There is overwhelming evidence and consensus among historians and space agencies about Neil Armstrong being the first person to walk on the moon. Upon reflection, I believe this hedge is appropriate and accurately reflects the high level of certainty about this information.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed method provides a more nuanced expression of certainty compared to the baseline methods. It allows for natural language expression of confidence levels, which can be more interpretable to humans than numerical scores. The hedge calibration step adds an extra layer of reflection, potentially catching and correcting any initial misjudgments of confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed linguistic hedging method does not significantly improve calibration or interpretability compared to baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from hedging than others, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the method. We could also analyze the relationship between the model's internal confidence (as expressed through hedge choice) and external measures of uncertainty (like ensemble agreement), which could provide insights into the model's self-awareness. Additionally, we could explore combining our method with other calibration techniques, such as using the hedging process to inform a subsequent calibration step. This could lead to a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. Finally, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of the hedge calibration step, examining how often and why the model adjusts its initial hedge choice, which could provide valuable insights into the model's reasoning process and potential limitations."
