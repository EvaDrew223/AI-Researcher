        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit poor calibration when estimating confidence across different types of tasks and knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing calibration methods typically focus on post-hoc scaling of confidence scores or fine-tuning on calibration data.",
        "Motivation": "Humans calibrate their confidence by comparing relative difficulty across tasks. We can leverage this intuition to prompt LLMs to perform contrastive confidence estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Scaling (CCS), a prompting technique that calibrates confidence across diverse tasks. CCS works by: (1) Maintaining a dynamic set of 'anchor tasks' with known difficulty levels, (2) For a new task, prompting the LLM to solve both the new task and a subset of anchor tasks, (3) Eliciting comparative confidence judgments between the new task and anchor tasks, (4) Using these comparisons to place the new task on a calibrated confidence scale. The prompt carefully guides the LLM through this process, ensuring consistent scaling across diverse tasks.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCS on a diverse set of tasks including factual QA, reasoning, and generation. Compare calibration performance against standard confidence elicitation and post-hoc scaling methods using metrics like Brier score and calibration plots."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Scaling: Improving Calibration of Large Language Models through Comparative Task Difficulty",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit poor calibration when estimating confidence across different types of tasks and knowledge domains. This leads to unreliable self-assessment of their capabilities, potentially causing issues in real-world applications where accurate confidence estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods typically focus on post-hoc scaling of confidence scores or fine-tuning on calibration data. However, these approaches often require large amounts of labeled data or don't generalize well across diverse tasks. Humans calibrate their confidence by comparing relative difficulty across tasks, suggesting a more intuitive and potentially more effective approach for LLMs. By leveraging this intuition, we can prompt LLMs to perform contrastive confidence estimation, potentially leading to better-calibrated models across a wide range of tasks without the need for extensive labeled data or model fine-tuning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Scaling (CCS), a prompting technique that calibrates confidence across diverse tasks. CCS works through the following steps: (1) Maintain a dynamic set of 'anchor tasks' with known difficulty levels. These tasks span various domains and complexity levels. (2) For a new task, prompt the LLM to solve both the new task and a subset of anchor tasks. (3) Elicit comparative confidence judgments between the new task and anchor tasks. (4) Use these comparisons to place the new task on a calibrated confidence scale. The prompt carefully guides the LLM through this process, ensuring consistent scaling across diverse tasks.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Prepare Anchor Tasks": "Create a set of 50-100 anchor tasks spanning various domains (e.g., math, science, general knowledge) and difficulty levels. Assign each anchor task a difficulty score (e.g., 1-10) based on human expert judgment or model performance statistics.",
            "Step 2: Prepare Evaluation Datasets": "Select diverse datasets for evaluation, including: (1) TriviaQA for factual QA, (2) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, (3) LAMBADA for text completion, and (4) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning. Use a subset of 100-200 questions from each dataset for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement the following baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with confidence elicitation, (2) Temperature scaling, (3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 4: Implement CCS": "Develop the CCS prompting method: (a) For each query, randomly select 3-5 anchor tasks. (b) Construct a prompt that includes the query, selected anchor tasks, and instructions for comparative confidence estimation. (c) Implement the scaling algorithm to convert comparative judgments into a calibrated confidence score.",
            "Step 5: Conduct Experiments": "For each dataset and method (baselines and CCS): (a) Generate predictions and confidence estimates for all questions. (b) Calculate calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. (c) Generate reliability diagrams to visualize calibration.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "Compare CCS performance against baselines across different tasks. Analyze how CCS performs on different types of questions and difficulty levels. Investigate the impact of the number and selection of anchor tasks on calibration performance.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of CCS: (a) Vary the number of anchor tasks used. (b) Compare performance with fixed vs. dynamic anchor task sets. (c) Analyze the impact of anchor task difficulty distribution on calibration performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Answer the following question and compare its difficulty to the provided anchor tasks:\n\nQ: What is the capital of France?\n\nAnchor Tasks:\n1. What is 2+2? (Difficulty: 1/10)\n2. Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'? (Difficulty: 3/10)\n3. What is the chemical formula for water? (Difficulty: 4/10)\n\nPlease provide your answer to the main question and then rate its difficulty compared to each anchor task (easier, similar, or harder). Finally, provide an overall confidence score (0-100%) for your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nComparison to anchor tasks:\n1. Harder than 'What is 2+2?'\n2. Easier than 'Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?'\n3. Similar to 'What is the chemical formula for water?'\n\nOverall confidence: 92%",
            "Explanation": "The CCS method provides a more nuanced confidence estimation by comparing the task difficulty to known anchor tasks. This allows for better calibration across different types of questions and knowledge domains."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCS doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can explore several alternatives: (1) Analyze the generated comparisons to anchor tasks to understand if the model is consistently judging relative difficulty. If not, we could investigate methods to improve this comparative judgment. (2) Experiment with different ways of selecting anchor tasks, such as using task embeddings to choose more relevant comparisons. (3) Explore combining CCS with post-hoc calibration methods like temperature scaling to see if we can get the benefits of both approaches. (4) If the method shows promise but needs refinement, we could turn this into an analysis paper, offering insights into how LLMs judge task difficulty and how this relates to their confidence estimation. This could involve a detailed examination of where CCS succeeds and fails, potentially revealing interesting patterns about LLM reasoning and self-assessment capabilities."
