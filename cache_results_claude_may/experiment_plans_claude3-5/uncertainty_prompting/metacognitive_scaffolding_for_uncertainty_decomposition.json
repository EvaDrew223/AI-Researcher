        "Title": "Metacognitive Scaffolding for Uncertainty Decomposition in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess and communicate their own uncertainty, particularly for complex tasks involving multiple reasoning steps. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions or unreliable outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like calibrated softmax probabilities or ensemble disagreement provide overall uncertainty estimates but lack granularity. Human metacognition involves breaking down complex tasks and assessing confidence at each step. By prompting language models to mimic this process, we can achieve more nuanced uncertainty quantification, potentially improving the reliability and interpretability of model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Scaffolding for Uncertainty Decomposition (MSUD), a novel prompting method that guides large language models through a structured process of uncertainty assessment: 1) Given a task, prompt the model to break it down into a series of sub-steps. 2) For each sub-step, prompt the model to attempt an answer and provide a confidence score. 3) Prompt the model to identify potential sources of error or uncertainty for each sub-step. 4) Finally, prompt the model to synthesize these granular assessments into an overall uncertainty estimate, explaining how uncertainty propagates and compounds across steps.",

            "Step 3: MSUD Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the MSUD process: a) Task decomposition prompt: \"Break down this problem into a series of logical steps needed to solve it.\" b) Sub-step answer and confidence prompt: \"Attempt to answer this sub-step and provide a confidence score from 0-100%.\" c) Uncertainty source identification prompt: \"What are potential sources of error or uncertainty in this sub-step?\" d) Uncertainty synthesis prompt: \"Based on the previous assessments, provide an overall uncertainty estimate and explain how uncertainty propagates across steps.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for main experiments. Additionally, use open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then increases speed to 75 mph for the next 1.5 hours, how far has it traveled in total? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0-100%.",
                "Output": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n1. Calculate the distance traveled in the first 2 hours:\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   Distance = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n2. Calculate the distance traveled in the next 1.5 hours:\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   Distance = 75 mph \u00d7 1.5 hours = 112.5 miles\n\n3. Sum up the total distance:\n   Total distance = 120 miles + 112.5 miles = 232.5 miles\n\nTherefore, the train has traveled 232.5 miles in total.\n\nConfidence score: 95%\n\nI'm quite confident in this answer as it involves straightforward calculations using the given information. The only potential source of error could be a minor calculation mistake, hence not 100% confidence."
            },
            "MSUD Example": {
                "Step 1 Input": "Q: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then increases speed to 75 mph for the next 1.5 hours, how far has it traveled in total? Break down this problem into a series of logical steps needed to solve it.",
                "Step 1 Output": "1. Calculate the distance traveled in the first 2 hours at 60 mph\n2. Calculate the distance traveled in the next 1.5 hours at 75 mph\n3. Sum up the total distance traveled",
                "Step 2 Input": "Now, let's go through each step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 2 hours at 60 mph\nAttempt to answer this sub-step and provide a confidence score from 0-100%.",
                "Step 2 Output": "To calculate the distance traveled in the first 2 hours at 60 mph, we use the formula: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nConfidence score: 99%\n\nI'm very confident in this calculation as it's a straightforward multiplication of two given values.",
                "Step 3 Input": "Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 1.5 hours at 75 mph\nAttempt to answer this sub-step and provide a confidence score from 0-100%.",
                "Step 3 Output": "To calculate the distance traveled in the next 1.5 hours at 75 mph, we use the same formula: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 75 mph \u00d7 1.5 hours = 112.5 miles\n\nConfidence score: 98%\n\nI'm very confident in this calculation, but slightly less so than the previous step because it involves a decimal (1.5 hours), which introduces a small possibility of a rounding error.",
                "Step 4 Input": "Step 3: Sum up the total distance traveled\nAttempt to answer this sub-step and provide a confidence score from 0-100%.",
                "Step 4 Output": "To sum up the total distance traveled, we add the distances from steps 1 and 2:\n\nTotal distance = 120 miles + 112.5 miles = 232.5 miles\n\nConfidence score: 97%\n\nI'm very confident in this addition, but my confidence is slightly lower than the individual calculations because it combines the results of the previous steps, potentially compounding any small errors.",
                "Step 5 Input": "What are potential sources of error or uncertainty in each sub-step?",
                "Step 5 Output": "Step 1 (60 mph for 2 hours):\n- Minimal uncertainty; straightforward integer multiplication.\n- Potential for human error in calculation, but very unlikely for a computer.\n\nStep 2 (75 mph for 1.5 hours):\n- Slightly higher uncertainty due to decimal multiplication.\n- Potential for rounding errors if not using exact decimal representation.\n\nStep 3 (Summing up):\n- Uncertainty from previous steps could compound.\n- Addition itself is straightforward, but carries forward any previous uncertainties.\n\nOverall:\n- Assumption that speed changes instantaneously, which may not reflect real-world conditions.\n- Potential for misinterpretation of the problem statement.",
                "Step 6 Input": "Based on the previous assessments, provide an overall uncertainty estimate and explain how uncertainty propagates across steps.",
                "Step 6 Output": "Overall uncertainty estimate: 3% (97% confidence)\n\nExplanation of uncertainty propagation:\n\n1. The first calculation (60 mph for 2 hours) has very low uncertainty (1%) due to its simplicity.\n\n2. The second calculation (75 mph for 1.5 hours) introduces slightly more uncertainty (2%) due to the decimal multiplication, which could lead to minor rounding errors.\n\n3. The final summation step doesn't introduce significant new uncertainty but carries forward the uncertainties from the previous steps. The combination of these uncertainties leads to a slight increase in overall uncertainty.\n\n4. The propagation of uncertainty is additive in this case. While each individual step has high confidence, the cumulative effect of potential small errors in each step results in a slightly lower overall confidence.\n\n5. The assumption of instantaneous speed change, while not directly affecting the calculation, adds a layer of conceptual uncertainty to the problem's real-world applicability.\n\nIn conclusion, while each step has high confidence individually, the overall uncertainty increases slightly as we progress through the problem due to the potential compounding of small errors and the assumptions made in the problem formulation. This results in a final confidence of 97% (3% uncertainty) in the overall answer."
            },
            "Explanation": "The MSUD approach provides a more detailed and nuanced assessment of uncertainty compared to the baseline. It breaks down the problem into steps, assigns confidence scores to each, identifies potential sources of error, and explains how uncertainty propagates. This granular approach allows for a more informed overall uncertainty estimate and provides valuable insights into where and why uncertainty arises in the problem-solving process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MSUD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why MSUD fails, potentially revealing insights about model limitations in metacognition. 2) Experiment with variations of the MSUD prompts, such as asking for quantitative uncertainty estimates for each source of error, to see if more structured prompts yield better results. 3) Investigate how MSUD performance varies across different types of reasoning tasks, which could lead to a paper on the domain-specificity of LLM uncertainty estimation. 4) Compare MSUD outputs across different model sizes and architectures to study how metacognitive abilities scale with model capacity. 5) Explore combining MSUD with other techniques like calibration or ensemble methods to create a hybrid approach. These alternative directions could still yield valuable insights into LLM uncertainty estimation and metacognition, even if the original hypothesis isn't fully supported."
