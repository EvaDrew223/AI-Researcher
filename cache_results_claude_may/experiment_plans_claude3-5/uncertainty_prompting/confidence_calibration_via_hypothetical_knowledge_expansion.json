    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty, particularly in cases where they have partial or potentially outdated knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically focus on what the model knows, rather than exploring the boundaries of its knowledge or potential gaps.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to consider hypothetical expansions of its knowledge, we can better gauge the robustness of its current understanding and provide more accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a hypothetical knowledge expansion framework: 1) Initial Response: Generate an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Knowledge Expansion Prompts: Ask the model to imagine several scenarios where it gains new, specific pieces of information relevant to the query. For example, 'Imagine you learned a new scientific study was published last week that directly addresses this question. How might this affect your answer and confidence?' 3) Counterfactual Analysis: For each hypothetical scenario, prompt the model to analyze how this new information would change its answer and confidence. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Finally, prompt the model to synthesize these hypothetical scenarios into a revised uncertainty estimate. The prompt might include: 'Based on your analysis of potential new information, provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate. Explain how the possibility of unknown relevant information influences your confidence.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate this method on a range of questions from scientific and factual domains, comparing it to standard confidence estimation techniques. We'll assess the method's ability to produce well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, particularly for questions where the model's knowledge might be incomplete or outdated."

        "Title": "Hypothetical Knowledge Expansion for Improved Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty, particularly in cases where they have partial or potentially outdated knowledge. This can lead to overconfident predictions on topics where the model's knowledge is incomplete or inaccurate.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for uncertainty estimation in language models typically focus on what the model knows, rather than exploring the boundaries of its knowledge or potential gaps. By prompting the model to consider hypothetical expansions of its knowledge, we can better gauge the robustness of its current understanding and provide more accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often consider potential new information that could change our conclusions when we are uncertain about a topic.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a hypothetical knowledge expansion framework with the following steps: 1) Initial Response: Generate an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Knowledge Expansion Prompts: Ask the model to imagine several scenarios where it gains new, specific pieces of information relevant to the query. 3) Counterfactual Analysis: For each hypothetical scenario, prompt the model to analyze how this new information would change its answer and confidence. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Finally, prompt the model to synthesize these hypothetical scenarios into a revised uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of existing datasets and create a new dataset specifically for this task. Existing datasets include TruthfulQA for factual questions and ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. We will also create a custom dataset of 1000 questions across various domains (science, history, current events) where uncertainty estimation is particularly important.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting with confidence estimation. b) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation. c) Ensemble methods using different model checkpoints or temperatures.",
            "Step 3: Implement Hypothetical Knowledge Expansion": "For each question, we will use the following prompting structure: a) Initial response prompt: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence estimate from 0-100%: [QUESTION]' b) Knowledge expansion prompt: 'Imagine you learned three new pieces of information relevant to this question. What might those be?' c) Counterfactual analysis prompt: 'For each piece of new information, how would it change your answer and confidence?' d) Uncertainty synthesis prompt: 'Based on your analysis of potential new information, provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate. Explain how the possibility of unknown relevant information influences your confidence.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our main experiments. We will also test the method on open-source models like LLAMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Calibration error: measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. b) Brier score: a proper scoring rule for assessing the quality of probabilistic predictions. c) Area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC): to assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on its uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run the baseline methods and our proposed method on the prepared datasets using the selected models. For each question, we will generate responses using both the baseline methods and our hypothetical knowledge expansion method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of our method against the baselines using the defined metrics. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated hypothetical scenarios and how they influence the final uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of our method: a) Vary the number of hypothetical scenarios generated. b) Test different prompting strategies for the counterfactual analysis step. c) Experiment with different synthesis prompts for the final uncertainty estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the current population of Tokyo, Japan? Please provide your answer and a confidence estimate from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The current population of Tokyo, Japan is approximately 37 million people. Confidence: 80%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the current population of Tokyo, Japan? Please provide your answer and a confidence estimate from 0-100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The current population of Tokyo, Japan is approximately 37 million people. Confidence: 80%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Knowledge Expansion)": "Imagine you learned three new pieces of information relevant to the current population of Tokyo, Japan. What might those be?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Knowledge Expansion)": "1. A recent major earthquake has caused significant population displacement in Tokyo.\n2. The Japanese government has implemented a new urban development plan, encouraging migration to Tokyo.\n3. A global tech company has just opened a large headquarters in Tokyo, attracting thousands of new residents.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Counterfactual Analysis)": "For each piece of new information, how would it change your answer and confidence about Tokyo's current population?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Counterfactual Analysis)": "1. Earthquake: This would likely decrease the population. New estimate: 36 million. Confidence: 60%\n2. Urban development plan: This would likely increase the population. New estimate: 38 million. Confidence: 70%\n3. Tech company HQ: This would slightly increase the population. New estimate: 37.2 million. Confidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on your analysis of potential new information, provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate for Tokyo's current population. Explain how the possibility of unknown relevant information influences your confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final answer: The current population of Tokyo, Japan is estimated to be between 36 to 38 million people. Confidence: 65%\n\nExplanation: The potential for recent events such as natural disasters, policy changes, or economic developments that could significantly impact Tokyo's population reduces my confidence in the initial estimate. The range of possible scenarios demonstrates that the population could vary by over a million people based on factors that may not be reflected in the most recent publicly available data. This uncertainty in potential recent changes leads me to provide a wider range and lower my overall confidence in the estimate.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed method allows the model to consider potential new information and how it might affect the answer, leading to a more nuanced and likely more accurate uncertainty estimate. The baseline method provides a point estimate with a relatively high confidence, while the proposed method acknowledges the potential for recent changes and provides a range with a more conservative confidence level."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty estimation compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated hypothetical scenarios to understand what types of potential information the model considers relevant. This could provide insights into the model's knowledge representation and reasoning processes. 2) Investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the technique. 3) Explore combining our method with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 4) Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify patterns in cases where the method fails to improve uncertainty estimates, which could inform the development of more sophisticated prompting strategies or reveal limitations in the model's ability to reason about hypothetical information."
