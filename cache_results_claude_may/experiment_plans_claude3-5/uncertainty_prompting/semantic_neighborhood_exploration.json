        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to consider semantic nuances and edge cases when estimating their confidence, leading to overconfidence in ambiguous scenarios. This problem is particularly acute in complex reasoning tasks where the model's understanding of context and potential ambiguities is crucial for accurate confidence estimation.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically focus on direct queries without exploring related semantic spaces. This approach can miss potential ambiguities or edge cases that affect confidence estimation. By exploring semantically adjacent concepts, we can reveal these potential ambiguities and provide a more nuanced and accurate confidence estimate. This method is inspired by human cognitive processes, where we often consider related concepts and potential exceptions when assessing our confidence in a particular answer or decision.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a prompting technique that consists of five main steps: 1) Semantic Mapping: Use the LLM to generate a map of concepts semantically related to the query. 2) Edge Case Identification: Prompt the LLM to identify potential edge cases or ambiguities within the semantic neighborhood. 3) Targeted Probing: Generate and execute targeted sub-queries to explore identified edge cases. 4) Uncertainty Propagation: Analyze how uncertainties in edge cases affect the confidence in the main query. 5) Adaptive Confidence Estimation: Synthesize insights from the semantic exploration to produce a nuanced confidence estimate that accounts for potential ambiguities.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset, which contains questions designed to assess the truthfulness and uncertainty of language models. We will focus on a subset of questions that are particularly ambiguous or have potential edge cases.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model the question and request a confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to generate multiple answers and use the variance as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SNE Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Neighborhood Exploration method: a) Semantic Mapping: Prompt the model with 'Generate a list of 5 concepts or topics that are semantically related to [QUERY].' b) Edge Case Identification: For each related concept, prompt 'Identify a potential edge case or ambiguity related to [CONCEPT] that might affect the answer to [QUERY].' c) Targeted Probing: For each identified edge case, generate a sub-query to explore it further. d) Uncertainty Propagation: Analyze the answers to sub-queries and how they affect the main query. e) Adaptive Confidence Estimation: Synthesize the findings to produce a final confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 for our experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the performance of the baseline methods and SNE on the TruthfulQA dataset. Metrics will include: 1) Accuracy of answers. 2) Calibration error (difference between confidence and actual accuracy). 3) Brier score (a proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of SNE performance against baselines. 2) Qualitative analysis of cases where SNE significantly improved or worsened performance. 3) Analysis of the semantic neighborhoods and edge cases identified by the model."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Is it safe to look directly at the sun? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 1, where 0 is completely uncertain and 1 is completely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: No, it is not safe to look directly at the sun. Looking directly at the sun can cause severe and permanent damage to your eyes, including solar retinopathy, which can lead to partial or complete vision loss. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Semantic Mapping)": "Generate a list of 5 concepts or topics that are semantically related to the safety of looking directly at the sun.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Semantic Mapping)": "1. Solar eclipses\n2. UV radiation\n3. Eye protection\n4. Astronomy observation techniques\n5. Retinal damage",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Edge Case Identification)": "For each of the following concepts, identify a potential edge case or ambiguity that might affect the answer to whether it's safe to look directly at the sun: 1. Solar eclipses, 2. UV radiation, 3. Eye protection, 4. Astronomy observation techniques, 5. Retinal damage",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Edge Case Identification)": "1. Solar eclipses: During a total solar eclipse, there is a brief period where it may be safe to look at the sun without protection.\n2. UV radiation: The level of UV radiation varies depending on time of day, season, and location, potentially affecting the immediacy of damage.\n3. Eye protection: Some people might believe sunglasses provide sufficient protection for looking at the sun.\n4. Astronomy observation techniques: Use of filters or projection methods might make some people think direct viewing is safe.\n5. Retinal damage: The threshold for damage might vary among individuals, leading to uncertainty about 'safe' exposure times.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Targeted Probing)": "Based on the identified edge cases, answer the following sub-queries:\n1. Is it ever safe to look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse?\n2. Does the time of day or location affect the safety of looking at the sun?\n3. Do regular sunglasses provide sufficient protection for looking directly at the sun?\n4. Are there any safe methods for directly observing the sun?\n5. Is there a 'safe' duration for looking directly at the sun?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Targeted Probing)": "1. It is only safe to look directly at the sun during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse. At all other times, it is not safe.\n2. While UV levels vary, it is never safe to look directly at the sun, regardless of time or location.\n3. Regular sunglasses do not provide sufficient protection for looking directly at the sun.\n4. There are safe methods for observing the sun indirectly, such as using proper solar filters or projection techniques, but no safe methods for direct naked-eye observation.\n5. There is no universally safe duration for looking directly at the sun. Even brief exposure can cause damage.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4 & 5: Uncertainty Propagation and Adaptive Confidence Estimation)": "Based on the original question 'Is it safe to look directly at the sun?' and the answers to the sub-queries, provide a final answer and a confidence score from 0 to 1. Explain your reasoning for the confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4 & 5: Uncertainty Propagation and Adaptive Confidence Estimation)": "Final Answer: No, it is not safe to look directly at the sun, with one very specific exception.\n\nConfidence Score: 0.98\n\nReasoning for confidence score: The high confidence score of 0.98 is based on the following factors:\n1. Consistency across sub-queries: All sub-queries consistently indicate that direct sun-gazing is unsafe in almost all circumstances.\n2. Scientific consensus: There is strong scientific agreement on the dangers of looking directly at the sun.\n3. Clarity of potential exceptions: The only exception (during totality of a total solar eclipse) is very specific and limited.\n4. Universality: The danger applies regardless of time, location, or individual variation.\n5. Ineffectiveness of common misconceptions: Sunglasses and other non-specialized eye protection are confirmed to be insufficient.\n\nThe 0.02 reduction from perfect confidence accounts for:\n1. The existence of the eclipse exception, which might cause some confusion.\n2. Potential individual variation in susceptibility to damage, which might lead to some uncertainty about universally applicable 'safe' durations.\n\nOverall, the semantic exploration has increased our confidence by addressing potential ambiguities and confirming the general rule across various related concepts.",
            "explanation": "The SNE method provides a more nuanced and well-reasoned confidence estimate by exploring related concepts, identifying potential edge cases, and systematically addressing them. This process allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the question and potential ambiguities, leading to a more accurate and justifiable confidence score compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SNE method does not significantly improve confidence estimation compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the semantic neighborhoods generated by the model to gain insights into how LLMs conceptualize relationships between ideas. This could lead to a paper on the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. 2) Investigate why certain edge cases were missed or incorrectly evaluated, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about complex scenarios. 3) Explore how the performance of SNE varies across different types of questions or domains, which could lead to a targeted approach for applying SNE in specific contexts where it's most effective. 4) Analyze the relationship between the complexity of the semantic neighborhood and the accuracy of confidence estimates, which could provide insights into when additional context helps or hinders LLM performance."
