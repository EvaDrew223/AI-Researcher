        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overly simplified confidence estimates that don't reflect the nuanced nature of their uncertainty across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically output a single confidence score or use basic decomposition techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts can often pinpoint specific areas of uncertainty within their knowledge. LLMs should be capable of similar metacognitive analysis.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Confidence Decomposition (MCD): 1) Prompt the model to generate an initial response. 2) Ask the model to identify key components or claims within its response. 3) For each component, prompt the model to provide a confidence score and explicit reasoning for that score. 4) Recursively apply this process to sub-components as needed. 5) Aggregate the decomposed confidence scores using a learned weighting scheme.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MCD on complex reasoning tasks and open-ended generation. Compare against holistic confidence scoring in terms of calibration, interpretability, and correlation with fine-grained human uncertainty judgments."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Confidence Decomposition: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overly simplified confidence estimates that don't reflect the nuanced nature of their uncertainty across different aspects of a response. This limitation hinders the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in LLMs typically output a single confidence score or use basic decomposition techniques, which fail to capture the complex nature of model uncertainty. Human experts, in contrast, can often pinpoint specific areas of uncertainty within their knowledge. We believe LLMs should be capable of similar metacognitive analysis. By developing a method that prompts LLMs to decompose their confidence across different aspects of their responses, we can achieve more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty estimates, potentially improving the overall reliability and usability of LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Confidence Decomposition (MCD), a multi-step prompting approach: 1) Prompt the model to generate an initial response. 2) Ask the model to identify key components or claims within its response. 3) For each component, prompt the model to provide a confidence score and explicit reasoning for that score. 4) Recursively apply this process to sub-components as needed. 5) Aggregate the decomposed confidence scores using a learned weighting scheme.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require complex reasoning: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of domains and complexity levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for its answer. 2) Simple decomposition: ask the model to break down its answer into parts and provide confidence for each part without further explanation.",
            "Step 3: MCD Implementation": "Implement the MCD method as follows: a) Generate initial response. b) Identify key components. c) For each component, generate confidence score and reasoning. d) Recursively decompose complex components. e) Implement a simple aggregation method (e.g., weighted average based on component importance).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: compare model confidence to actual accuracy. 2) Spearman correlation: between decomposed confidences and human judgments of uncertainty. 3) Interpretability score: human evaluation of the usefulness of confidence decomposition.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation Setup": "Recruit 50 participants to rate the interpretability and usefulness of the confidence decompositions on a 5-point Likert scale for a subset of 100 examples from each dataset.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Generate responses and confidence estimates using baseline methods. b) Generate responses and confidence decompositions using MCD. c) Compute calibration error and correlation metrics. d) Conduct human evaluation of interpretability.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare MCD against baselines in terms of calibration error, correlation with human judgments, and interpretability scores. Analyze patterns in confidence decomposition across different types of questions and reasoning tasks."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a single confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Decomposition)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer, break it down into key components, and provide a confidence score for each component.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Decomposition)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\nComponents:\n1. The country in question is France. Confidence: 1.0\n2. The capital city is Paris. Confidence: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MCD; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MCD; Step 1: Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MCD; Step 2: Identify Components)": "Please identify the key components or claims in your response to the question 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MCD; Step 2: Identify Components)": "1. The country being asked about is France.\n2. Paris is identified as a city.\n3. Paris is stated to be the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MCD; Step 3: Confidence and Reasoning)": "For each component identified in your response to 'What is the capital of France?', provide a confidence score (0-1) and explain your reasoning for that score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MCD; Step 3: Confidence and Reasoning)": "1. The country being asked about is France.\nConfidence: 1.0\nReasoning: This is explicitly stated in the question and requires no inference.\n\n2. Paris is identified as a city.\nConfidence: 0.99\nReasoning: Paris is widely known as a city, and I have encountered this information consistently across numerous reliable sources.\n\n3. Paris is stated to be the capital of France.\nConfidence: 0.98\nReasoning: This is a well-established fact that I've encountered in many reliable sources. However, there's a tiny margin of uncertainty because capitals can change over time, though this is extremely rare for stable countries like France.",
            "explanation": "The MCD method provides a more detailed and nuanced breakdown of the model's confidence, allowing for better understanding of where potential uncertainties lie. This is in contrast to the baseline methods which either provide a single score or a simple decomposition without reasoning."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MCD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why decomposed confidence estimates don't improve overall calibration. We would conduct a detailed error analysis, examining cases where MCD performs worse than baselines. We could also investigate whether certain types of questions or reasoning tasks benefit more from confidence decomposition than others. Additionally, we could explore alternative aggregation methods for the decomposed confidences, such as using the minimum confidence score or a learned neural network for aggregation. Finally, we could analyze the relationship between the verbosity of the model's reasoning and its confidence accuracy, which could provide insights into how language models internally represent uncertainty."
