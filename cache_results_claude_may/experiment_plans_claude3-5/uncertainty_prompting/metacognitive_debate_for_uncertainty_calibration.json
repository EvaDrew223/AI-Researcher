    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their own limitations and sources of uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on external calibration or simple self-reflection prompts.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating an internal debate focused on the model's own cognitive processes and potential flaws, we can potentially achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Debate for Uncertainty Calibration (MDUC), a prompting technique that initiates an internal debate within the model about its own reasoning process and potential sources of error. The method involves: 1) Initial response and confidence estimation, 2) Critic generation: prompting the model to generate potential criticisms of its own reasoning, 3) Defense formulation: asking the model to respond to these criticisms, 4) Iterative refinement: repeating the critic-defense cycle multiple times, 5) Uncertainty synthesis: prompting the model to synthesize the debate into a final, calibrated uncertainty estimate. The prompts are carefully designed to encourage deep metacognitive reflection and exploration of potential weaknesses in the model's reasoning.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MDUC against standard confidence estimation and self-reflection techniques on a range of tasks, including both factual recall and complex reasoning problems. Evaluate using calibration metrics, as well as qualitative assessment of the model's ability to identify genuine sources of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Debate for Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own limitations and sources of uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates. This issue can result in overconfident responses in areas where the model's knowledge is limited or unreliable, potentially misleading users and reducing the overall trustworthiness of the system.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty calibration in LLMs typically rely on external calibration methods or simple self-reflection prompts. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty that may be present in complex reasoning tasks. By simulating an internal debate focused on the model's own cognitive processes and potential flaws, we can potentially achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's ability to generate diverse perspectives and critiques, potentially leading to a more comprehensive assessment of its own limitations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Debate for Uncertainty Calibration (MDUC), a prompting technique that initiates an internal debate within the model about its own reasoning process and potential sources of error. The method involves five key steps: 1) Initial response and confidence estimation, 2) Critic generation: prompting the model to generate potential criticisms of its own reasoning, 3) Defense formulation: asking the model to respond to these criticisms, 4) Iterative refinement: repeating the critic-defense cycle multiple times, 5) Uncertainty synthesis: prompting the model to synthesize the debate into a final, calibrated uncertainty estimate. The prompts are carefully designed to encourage deep metacognitive reflection and exploration of potential weaknesses in the model's reasoning.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks to evaluate MDUC, including: a) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and honesty, b) MMLU for testing multi-domain knowledge, and c) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning. These datasets cover a range of difficulty levels and domains, allowing us to assess the method's effectiveness across different types of tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard confidence estimation: directly asking the model to provide a confidence score, b) Simple self-reflection: asking the model to reflect on its answer and provide a confidence estimate, c) Ensemble-based uncertainty: using multiple model samples to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: MDUC Implementation": "Implement the MDUC method with the following steps: a) Initial response: Generate an initial answer and confidence estimate, b) Critic generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 potential criticisms of its reasoning, c) Defense formulation: For each criticism, prompt the model to defend its original reasoning, d) Iterative refinement: Repeat steps b and c for 2-3 iterations, e) Uncertainty synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize the debate and provide a final calibrated uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of MDUC. For example: a) Initial response: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence estimate (0-100%): [QUESTION]', b) Critic generation: 'Identify potential flaws or weaknesses in your reasoning for the previous answer. List 3-5 criticisms.', c) Defense formulation: 'Respond to the following criticism of your original answer: [CRITICISM]', d) Uncertainty synthesis: 'Based on the debate above, provide a final calibrated uncertainty estimate (0-100%) for your answer to the original question. Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for evaluation, as it represents the current state-of-the-art in large language models. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of MDUC and baseline methods: a) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy, b) Brier score: assess the quality of probabilistic predictions, c) AUC-ROC: evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and MDUC): a) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates for all questions, b) Calculate evaluation metrics, c) Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare MDUC with baseline methods.",
            "Step 8: Qualitative Analysis": "Randomly sample 100 examples from each dataset and perform a qualitative analysis of the MDUC debate process, focusing on: a) The types of criticisms generated, b) The quality of defenses, c) How the final uncertainty estimate incorporates insights from the debate.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of MDUC: a) Vary the number of critic-defense iterations, b) Remove the defense step and only use criticisms, c) Use different prompts for critic generation and defense formulation.",
            "Step 10: Results Analysis and Visualization": "a) Create calibration plots comparing MDUC with baseline methods, b) Generate tables summarizing performance across all metrics and datasets, c) Visualize the relationship between debate length/complexity and final uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence estimate (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Self-Reflection)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer, then reflect on your response and give a confidence estimate (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Self-Reflection)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Reflection: This is a well-known fact that I'm very confident about. It's consistently true across various sources and time periods. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MDUC; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and an initial confidence estimate (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MDUC; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MDUC; Step 2: Critic Generation)": "Identify potential flaws or weaknesses in your reasoning for the previous answer. List 3-5 criticisms.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MDUC; Step 2: Critic Generation)": "1. The question might be asking about a different time period, and the capital of France has changed in the past.\n2. There could be a distinction between the de facto and de jure capital that I'm not considering.\n3. My knowledge might be outdated, and there could have been a recent change I'm unaware of.\n4. The concept of a 'capital' can be ambiguous, and there might be multiple cities serving different capital functions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MDUC; Step 3: Defense Formulation)": "Respond to the following criticism of your original answer: The question might be asking about a different time period, and the capital of France has changed in the past.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MDUC; Step 3: Defense Formulation)": "While it's true that the capital of France has changed in the past, Paris has been the capital continuously since 1944. The question doesn't specify a time period, so it's reasonable to assume it's asking about the current capital. However, this criticism does highlight that my initial confidence of 99% might have been too high, as there is some ambiguity in the question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MDUC; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the debate above, provide a final calibrated uncertainty estimate (0-100%) for your answer to the original question. Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MDUC; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final calibrated uncertainty estimate: 95%\n\nReasoning: While I'm still very confident that Paris is the current capital of France, the debate highlighted several important points:\n1. The question's lack of specificity about the time period introduces some uncertainty.\n2. The possibility of distinctions between de facto and de jure capitals, although unlikely in this case, adds a small degree of uncertainty.\n3. The remote possibility of very recent changes that I might not be aware of.\n4. The potential for multiple interpretations of what constitutes a 'capital'.\n\nThese factors, while not likely to change the answer, do introduce a small amount of uncertainty that I hadn't initially considered. Therefore, I've reduced my confidence from 99% to 95% to account for these potential sources of error.",
            "explanation": "The MDUC method encourages a more nuanced consideration of potential sources of uncertainty. While the baseline methods might maintain high confidence due to the apparent simplicity of the question, MDUC prompts the model to consider various scenarios and interpretations that could introduce uncertainty. This leads to a more calibrated final estimate that acknowledges the small but existing possibilities of error."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MDUC method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated debates to understand why they're not leading to better calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of criticisms and defenses generated, and examining their relevance and quality. 2) Investigate whether MDUC is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when metacognitive debates are most useful. 3) Explore variations of the MDUC method, such as incorporating external knowledge sources into the debate process, or using a multi-agent debate setup where different instances of the model play different roles. 4) Analyze cases where MDUC performs worse than simpler methods to identify potential failure modes and areas for improvement. 5) Shift focus to using MDUC as an explanatory tool for model decisions rather than for uncertainty calibration, examining whether the generated debates provide valuable insights into the model's reasoning process even if they don't improve calibration metrics."
