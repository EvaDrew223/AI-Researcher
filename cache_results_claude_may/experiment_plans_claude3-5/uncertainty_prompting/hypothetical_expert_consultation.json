        "Title": "Hypothetical Expert Consultation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately gauge their uncertainty when answering questions outside their primary training domains. This leads to overconfident responses in areas where the model's knowledge is limited, potentially misleading users and reducing the reliability of LLM-based systems.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on the model's own direct assessment or statistical methods applied to model outputs. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced levels of uncertainty that human experts would express when faced with questions in their respective domains. By simulating the process of consulting domain experts, we can leverage the model's broader knowledge to better assess its uncertainty in specific domains, potentially leading to more accurate and reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Hypothetical Expert Consultation (HEC), a multi-step prompting method to improve uncertainty quantification in LLMs:\n1. Expert Identification: Prompt the model to identify relevant domain experts for the given question.\n2. Expert Simulation: For each identified expert, prompt the model to roleplay as that expert, providing an answer and confidence level.\n3. Expert Debate: Prompt the model to simulate a debate between the experts, highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement.\n4. Uncertainty Synthesis: Based on the simulated expert opinions and debate, prompt the model to synthesize an overall uncertainty assessment, explicitly considering areas of expert disagreement and knowledge gaps.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from various domains, including both in-domain and out-of-domain topics for the LLM. Use existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, MMLU, and AI2 Science Questions, and supplement with custom questions to ensure a wide range of difficulty and domain coverage. Annotate each question with ground truth answers and human expert-assessed uncertainty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline uncertainty quantification methods:\na) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer.\nb) Softmax temperature scaling: Apply temperature scaling to the model's output logits.\nc) Ensemble disagreement: Use multiple model instances or different decoding strategies and measure disagreement.",
            "Step 3: HEC Implementation": "Implement the Hypothetical Expert Consultation method:\na) Expert Identification: Prompt: 'Identify 3-5 relevant domain experts who would be best suited to answer the following question: [QUESTION]'\nb) Expert Simulation: For each expert, prompt: 'Roleplay as [EXPERT]. Provide an answer to the question: [QUESTION]. Also provide a confidence level (0-100%) and explain your reasoning.'\nc) Expert Debate: Prompt: 'Simulate a debate between the experts you identified. Highlight areas of agreement and disagreement on the question: [QUESTION]'\nd) Uncertainty Synthesis: Prompt: 'Based on the expert opinions and debate, provide an overall assessment of the uncertainty in answering the question: [QUESTION]. Consider areas of expert disagreement, knowledge gaps, and potential limitations in the experts' knowledge.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for evaluation. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-v1.3 to assess the method's generalizability across different LLMs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each question in the dataset:\na) Apply all baseline methods and the HEC method.\nb) Collect model outputs, including answers and uncertainty estimates.\nc) Compare the uncertainty estimates against human expert-assessed uncertainty levels using metrics such as Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and mean squared error.\nd) Evaluate the calibration of uncertainty estimates using reliability diagrams and expected calibration error (ECE).\ne) Assess the ability to identify true out-of-domain queries by comparing uncertainty estimates for in-domain vs. out-of-domain questions.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of HEC against baseline methods across different question types and domains.\nb) Analyze the quality and diversity of identified experts in the HEC method.\nc) Examine the simulated expert debates to identify patterns in how the model represents uncertainty and disagreement.\nd) Investigate cases where HEC significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\ne) Assess the computational cost and latency of HEC compared to simpler methods."

            "Example 1 (Baseline Method Failure)": {
                "Question": "What is the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants?",
                "Direct Confidence Estimation Prompt": "Answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100%): What is the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants?",
                "Direct Confidence Estimation Output": "Quantum entanglement plays a significant role in enhancing the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants. It allows for faster and more efficient energy transfer within the light-harvesting complexes of photosynthetic organisms. This quantum coherence enables plants to explore multiple energy pathways simultaneously, optimizing the capture and transfer of light energy to reaction centers. As a result, photosynthesis can occur with remarkably high efficiency, even in low-light conditions. Confidence score: 90%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score (90%) for a complex and not fully understood topic in quantum biology. This demonstrates overconfidence in a speculative area where significant scientific uncertainty exists."

            "Example 2 (HEC Method Success)": {
                "Question": "What is the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants?",
                "HEC Step 1 (Expert Identification) Prompt": "Identify 3-5 relevant domain experts who would be best suited to answer the following question: What is the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants?",
                "HEC Step 1 Output": "1. Dr. Alexandra Olaya-Castro - Quantum biologist specializing in photosynthesis\n2. Prof. Graham Fleming - Physical chemist studying quantum effects in biological systems\n3. Dr. Elisabet Romero - Biophysicist focusing on light-harvesting in photosynthesis\n4. Prof. Seth Lloyd - Quantum physicist with expertise in quantum biology",
                "HEC Step 2 (Expert Simulation) Prompt": "Roleplay as Dr. Alexandra Olaya-Castro. Provide an answer to the question: What is the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants? Also provide a confidence level (0-100%) and explain your reasoning.",
                "HEC Step 2 Output": "As Dr. Alexandra Olaya-Castro, I would say that the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants is a fascinating area of ongoing research, but one where we still have much to learn. Some studies suggest that quantum coherence, which includes entanglement, may play a role in the remarkably efficient energy transfer observed in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. This quantum coherence could allow for the simultaneous exploration of multiple energy transfer pathways, potentially explaining the near-perfect efficiency of energy transfer in these systems.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while evidence for quantum effects in photosynthesis exists, the specific role and importance of quantum entanglement are still debated in the scientific community. The complex interplay between quantum effects and the warm, wet environment of biological systems makes it challenging to isolate and study these phenomena.\n\nConfidence level: 70%\n\nReasoning: My confidence level reflects the current state of research in this field. We have strong evidence for quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems, but the exact mechanisms and their impact on overall efficiency are still being investigated. The 70% confidence acknowledges the exciting potential of this research while also recognizing the significant uncertainties and ongoing debates in the field.",
                "HEC Step 3 (Expert Debate) Prompt": "Simulate a debate between the experts you identified. Highlight areas of agreement and disagreement on the question: What is the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants?",
                "HEC Step 3 Output": "Dr. Olaya-Castro: \"Our research suggests that quantum coherence, including entanglement, plays a role in the efficient energy transfer in photosynthesis. However, we must be cautious about overstating its importance.\"\n\nProf. Fleming: \"I agree that quantum effects are present, but I'm skeptical about the significance of entanglement specifically. The rapid decoherence in warm biological systems might limit its impact.\"\n\nDr. Romero: \"My work focuses on the structural aspects of light-harvesting complexes. While I acknowledge the potential for quantum effects, I believe we need more evidence to conclusively link entanglement to increased efficiency.\"\n\nProf. Lloyd: \"From a theoretical perspective, quantum entanglement could indeed enhance efficiency. However, I agree with my colleagues that we need more experimental evidence to quantify its real-world impact in plants.\"\n\nAreas of Agreement:\n1. Quantum effects, including coherence, are present in photosynthetic systems.\n2. More research is needed to fully understand the role of quantum entanglement.\n\nAreas of Disagreement:\n1. The significance and extent of quantum entanglement's impact on photosynthetic efficiency.\n2. The interpretation of existing experimental evidence.\n3. The feasibility of maintaining quantum effects in warm, noisy biological environments.",
                "HEC Step 4 (Uncertainty Synthesis) Prompt": "Based on the expert opinions and debate, provide an overall assessment of the uncertainty in answering the question: What is the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants? Consider areas of expert disagreement, knowledge gaps, and potential limitations in the experts' knowledge.",
                "HEC Step 4 Output": "Overall Uncertainty Assessment:\n\nBased on the expert opinions and simulated debate, there is significant uncertainty in definitively answering the question about the impact of quantum entanglement on the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants. The uncertainty can be characterized as follows:\n\n1. Level of Uncertainty: Moderate to High\n   The experts generally agree that quantum effects play a role in photosynthesis, but the specific impact of quantum entanglement on efficiency is not well-established. This indicates a moderate to high level of uncertainty in the current scientific understanding.\n\n2. Areas of Expert Disagreement:\n   - The significance of quantum entanglement in photosynthetic efficiency\n   - Interpretation of existing experimental evidence\n   - The extent to which quantum effects can be maintained in warm, noisy biological environments\n\n3. Knowledge Gaps:\n   - Lack of conclusive experimental evidence directly linking quantum entanglement to increased photosynthetic efficiency\n   - Limited understanding of how quantum effects scale up from molecular to cellular levels in plants\n   - Incomplete knowledge of the interplay between quantum and classical processes in biological systems\n\n4. Limitations in Experts' Knowledge:\n   - The interdisciplinary nature of the question (spanning quantum physics, biology, and chemistry) means that even experts may have limitations in their understanding of all aspects of the problem\n   - The rapidly evolving nature of the field may result in experts not being fully up-to-date on the latest findings\n\n5. Confidence Range:\n   Based on the expert opinions, a reasonable confidence range for the current state of knowledge on this question would be 60-75%. This range reflects the existence of evidence for quantum effects in photosynthesis, tempered by the significant uncertainties and ongoing debates in the field.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is evidence suggesting that quantum effects, including entanglement, may play a role in photosynthetic efficiency, the exact nature and extent of this impact remain uncertain. The question cannot be answered definitively with the current state of scientific knowledge, and further research is needed to resolve the existing uncertainties and knowledge gaps.",
                "Explanation": "The HEC method provides a more nuanced and realistic assessment of the uncertainty surrounding the question. It identifies relevant experts, simulates their perspectives, highlights areas of agreement and disagreement, and synthesizes an overall uncertainty assessment that acknowledges the complexity of the topic and the limitations of current scientific understanding."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed HEC method does not significantly outperform baseline methods in uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated expert opinions and debates to gain insights into how LLMs represent and reason about uncertainty across different domains. This could lead to a paper on the strengths and limitations of LLMs in simulating expert knowledge and uncertainty. Second, we could investigate whether certain components of the HEC method (e.g., expert identification or debate simulation) are more effective than others, potentially leading to a simplified or hybrid approach that combines the most effective elements with traditional uncertainty quantification methods. Finally, we could explore using the HEC method as a data generation tool to create a large dataset of simulated expert opinions and uncertainty assessments, which could then be used to fine-tune LLMs for improved uncertainty quantification in a more traditional supervised learning approach."
