        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture complex interdependencies between different aspects of model confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-dimensional confidence scores or basic ensemble disagreement metrics.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by quantum entanglement in physics, we hypothesize that model uncertainty exhibits intricate, non-local correlations that can be better captured through a multi-dimensional representation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Entanglement Prompting (QEP), which represents model uncertainty as a multi-qubit quantum state. The prompting process involves: 1) Initializing a set of 'uncertainty qubits' corresponding to different aspects of the task. 2) Applying a series of 'uncertainty gates' through carefully crafted prompts that entangle these qubits. 3) Measuring the final quantum state to obtain a rich, multi-dimensional uncertainty representation. This approach allows for capturing complex uncertainty correlations and interference effects between different aspects of model knowledge.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate QEP against standard uncertainty estimation methods on diverse tasks including multi-hop reasoning, open-ended generation, and multi-modal understanding. Assess both calibration and discrimination metrics, as well as the method's ability to capture nuanced uncertainty relationships."

        "Title": "Quantum Entanglement Prompting: A Multi-Dimensional Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture complex interdependencies between different aspects of model confidence, leading to unreliable or incomplete uncertainty estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-dimensional confidence scores or basic ensemble disagreement metrics, which may not fully capture the nuanced and interconnected nature of model uncertainty. Inspired by quantum entanglement in physics, we hypothesize that model uncertainty exhibits intricate, non-local correlations that can be better captured through a multi-dimensional representation. By representing uncertainty as a multi-qubit quantum state, we aim to model complex uncertainty relationships and interference effects between different aspects of model knowledge, potentially leading to more accurate and comprehensive uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Entanglement Prompting (QEP), which represents model uncertainty as a multi-qubit quantum state. The prompting process involves three main steps: 1) Initializing a set of 'uncertainty qubits' corresponding to different aspects of the task. 2) Applying a series of 'uncertainty gates' through carefully crafted prompts that entangle these qubits. 3) Measuring the final quantum state to obtain a rich, multi-dimensional uncertainty representation. This approach allows for capturing complex uncertainty correlations and interference effects between different aspects of model knowledge.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Define Uncertainty Aspects": "Identify key aspects of uncertainty for each task type (e.g., factual knowledge, reasoning ability, context understanding for question-answering tasks).",
            "Step 2: Design Qubit Initialization Prompts": "Create prompts that initialize each uncertainty qubit based on the identified aspects. For example: 'On a scale of 0 to 1, how certain are you about the factual information needed to answer this question?'",
            "Step 3: Design Entanglement Prompts": "Develop a series of prompts that create entanglement between qubits. For instance: 'How does your certainty about the factual information influence your confidence in the reasoning required for this task?'",
            "Step 4: Implement Quantum State Representation": "Use a quantum computing library (e.g., Qiskit) to represent and manipulate the multi-qubit state based on the model's responses to the initialization and entanglement prompts.",
            "Step 5: Design Measurement Prompts": "Create prompts that correspond to measuring the final quantum state, translating the measurement results into interpretable uncertainty metrics.",
            "Step 6: Prepare Datasets": "Select diverse datasets covering multi-hop reasoning (e.g., HotpotQA), open-ended generation (e.g., CommonGen), and multi-modal understanding (e.g., VQA-v2).",
            "Step 7: Implement Baselines": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods such as softmax probabilities, Monte Carlo dropout, and ensemble disagreement.",
            "Step 8: Apply QEP and Baselines": "Run experiments applying both QEP and baseline methods to the selected datasets using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 9: Evaluate Results": "Compare QEP against baselines using calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error) and discrimination metrics (e.g., AUROC for confidence-based error detection).",
            "Step 10: Analyze Multi-dimensional Uncertainty": "Investigate how QEP captures uncertainty correlations by visualizing the multi-qubit state and analyzing its properties in relation to task performance."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in which year did this happen?",
                "Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon in 1969. Confidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score, which may not capture nuanced uncertainties about different aspects of the answer."
            },
            "QEP Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in which year did this happen?",
                "Qubit Initialization": "Factual Knowledge Qubit: 0.9, Temporal Accuracy Qubit: 0.8, Context Understanding Qubit: 0.95",
                "Entanglement Prompts": "How does your certainty about the person's identity affect your confidence in the year? How does your understanding of space exploration history influence both?",
                "Final Quantum State": "|\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.7|000\u27e9 + 0.3|001\u27e9 + 0.5|010\u27e9 + 0.4|100\u27e9",
                "Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon in 1969. Uncertainty representation: [0.7, 0.3, 0.5, 0.4] corresponding to [high certainty, slight doubt about year, moderate doubt about historical context, some doubt about person's identity]",
                "Explanation": "QEP provides a multi-dimensional uncertainty representation, capturing nuanced relationships between different aspects of the model's confidence."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If QEP does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct an in-depth analysis of the quantum state representations to understand why. This could involve examining the correlation between different uncertainty aspects and task performance, potentially revealing insights into the model's decision-making process. We may also explore alternative quantum representations, such as using different quantum gates or increasing the number of qubits to capture more fine-grained uncertainty aspects. Additionally, we could investigate how QEP performs on edge cases where traditional methods struggle, which might lead to a hybrid approach combining strengths of both QEP and conventional methods. Finally, we could pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on what the quantum representation reveals about the nature of uncertainty in language models, even if it doesn't directly improve quantification accuracy."
