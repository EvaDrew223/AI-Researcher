        "Problem": "Current confidence estimation methods often produce point estimates, failing to capture the nuanced and potentially multi-modal nature of a model's uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically output a single confidence score or a simple probability distribution over possible answers.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence often exists on a spectrum and can vary based on different aspects of a question. By eliciting a more granular representation of confidence, we can potentially capture a richer and more accurate picture of model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Spectrum Elicitation (CSE), a novel prompting technique that encourages the model to express its confidence as a distribution over a predefined spectrum. The prompt instructs the model to allocate 100 'confidence points' across five categories: 'Highly Uncertain', 'Somewhat Uncertain', 'Neutral', 'Somewhat Certain', and 'Highly Certain'. For example, a response might be '10,20,40,20,10'. Additionally, the model is asked to provide brief justifications for each non-zero allocation. This method allows for the expression of nuanced, multi-modal confidence distributions. To aggregate responses across multiple prompts or samples, we can use techniques from opinion pooling literature, such as linear or logarithmic pooling.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will compare CSE against traditional confidence estimation methods on a range of tasks, including open-ended generation and multi-choice QA. We'll introduce new metrics to evaluate the quality of the confidence spectra, such as Spectrum Calibration Error (SCE) and Justification Coherence Score (JCS). We'll also conduct a human evaluation to assess the interpretability and perceived accuracy of the confidence spectra compared to single-point estimates."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Elicitation: A Novel Prompting Method for Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current confidence estimation methods for large language models often produce point estimates, failing to capture the nuanced and potentially multi-modal nature of a model's uncertainty. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret model confidence across various tasks and domains.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically output a single confidence score or a simple probability distribution over possible answers. However, human confidence often exists on a spectrum and can vary based on different aspects of a question. By eliciting a more granular representation of confidence, we can potentially capture a richer and more accurate picture of model uncertainty. This approach is inspired by the multi-faceted nature of human confidence and aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of model uncertainty, which could lead to improved decision-making in critical applications of language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Spectrum Elicitation (CSE), a novel prompting technique that encourages the model to express its confidence as a distribution over a predefined spectrum. The method works as follows:\n1. Define a confidence spectrum with five categories: 'Highly Uncertain', 'Somewhat Uncertain', 'Neutral', 'Somewhat Certain', and 'Highly Certain'.\n2. Prompt the model to allocate 100 'confidence points' across these five categories.\n3. Ask the model to provide brief justifications for each non-zero allocation.\n4. To aggregate responses across multiple prompts or samples, use techniques from opinion pooling literature, such as linear or logarithmic pooling.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering different task types:\n- Open-ended generation: Use the CommonGen dataset\n- Multi-choice QA: Use the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) dataset\n- Factual QA: Use the TruthfulQA dataset",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\n1. Traditional confidence estimation: Use the model's output probability as the confidence score\n2. Binary confidence elicitation: Prompt the model to provide a binary confidence assessment (confident/not confident) along with a justification",
            "Step 4: CSE Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Spectrum Elicitation method:\n1. Design the CSE prompt template\n2. Implement the confidence point allocation mechanism\n3. Implement the justification elicitation for non-zero allocations",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metric Design": "Develop new metrics to evaluate the quality of the confidence spectra:\n1. Spectrum Calibration Error (SCE): Measure the discrepancy between the allocated confidence points and the actual performance across multiple samples\n2. Justification Coherence Score (JCS): Use an LLM to rate the coherence and relevance of the provided justifications on a scale of 1-5",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\n1. Generate answers using standard prompting\n2. Apply baseline confidence estimation methods\n3. Apply the CSE method\n4. Collect confidence spectra, justifications, and model outputs",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare SCE scores across baseline methods and CSE\n2. Analyze JCS distributions for CSE outputs\n3. Examine the relationship between confidence spectra and task performance\n4. Investigate multi-modality in confidence distributions\n5. Analyze justifications to identify patterns in model reasoning about its own confidence",
            "Step 8: Aggregation Study": "Implement and compare different aggregation methods (e.g., linear pooling, logarithmic pooling) for combining multiple CSE outputs",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "1. Vary the number of categories in the confidence spectrum\n2. Test the impact of including or excluding justifications\n3. Experiment with different total point allocations (e.g., 10 points, 1000 points)"
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: Paris\nHow confident are you in this answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "I am very confident in this answer. Paris is widely known and recognized as the capital city of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: Paris\nPlease allocate 100 confidence points across the following categories to express your confidence in this answer: [Highly Uncertain, Somewhat Uncertain, Neutral, Somewhat Certain, Highly Certain]. For each non-zero allocation, provide a brief justification.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Confidence point allocation:\nHighly Uncertain: 0\nSomewhat Uncertain: 0\nNeutral: 0\nSomewhat Certain: 5\nHighly Certain: 95\n\nJustifications:\nSomewhat Certain (5 points): While I'm very confident, there's always a small chance of human error or a recent change I'm not aware of.\nHighly Certain (95 points): Paris is universally recognized as the capital of France. This is a well-established fact taught in geography classes worldwide and confirmed by official sources.",
            "Explanation": "The CSE method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence, allowing for the expression of slight uncertainty even in cases where the model is highly confident. It also encourages the model to provide justifications for its confidence levels, offering insight into its reasoning process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSE method doesn't show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the patterns in confidence spectra across different types of questions and tasks. This could provide insights into how models assess their own knowledge and uncertainties in different domains.\n2. Investigate the relationship between the granularity of the confidence spectrum and the model's ability to accurately assess its confidence. We could experiment with different numbers of categories or even allow the model to define its own confidence categories.\n3. Focus on the justifications provided by the model. We could analyze these to understand the reasoning patterns the model uses when assessing its own confidence, potentially uncovering interesting insights about model behavior and limitations.\n4. Explore how CSE performs in an iterative setting, where the model is allowed to refine its answer and confidence assessment over multiple rounds. This could lead to insights about how models 'change their minds' or become more certain with additional processing time.\n5. Investigate how CSE outputs could be used to improve model performance, perhaps by using them to guide a selective querying process in a retrieval-augmented generation setup."
