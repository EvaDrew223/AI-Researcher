        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in multi-step reasoning tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect conclusions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like chain-of-thought prompting focus on improving reasoning but don't explicitly track uncertainty propagation.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by error propagation techniques in scientific computing, we can guide LLMs to explicitly consider how uncertainty accumulates across reasoning steps.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Incremental Uncertainty Propagation (IUP) prompting. For each reasoning step, we prompt the LLM to: (1) Provide the intermediate conclusion, (2) Estimate uncertainty for that step (e.g. 'Confidence: 80%'), (3) Explain how this uncertainty affects the overall conclusion. The prompt includes instructions like 'For each step, state your conclusion, estimate your confidence, and explain how this uncertainty impacts the final answer.' This approach encourages the model to maintain awareness of cumulative uncertainty throughout the reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare IUP against standard chain-of-thought and direct prompting on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH. Evaluate both task performance and calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error."

        "Title": "Incremental Uncertainty Propagation: Improving Confidence Calibration in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in multi-step reasoning tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect conclusions. This issue is particularly pronounced in complex problem-solving scenarios where errors can compound across multiple reasoning steps.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like chain-of-thought prompting focus on improving reasoning but don't explicitly track uncertainty propagation. Inspired by error propagation techniques in scientific computing, we propose a method to guide LLMs to explicitly consider how uncertainty accumulates across reasoning steps. This approach could lead to better-calibrated confidence estimates and more reliable multi-step reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Incremental Uncertainty Propagation (IUP) prompting. For each reasoning step, we prompt the LLM to: (1) Provide the intermediate conclusion, (2) Estimate uncertainty for that step (e.g. 'Confidence: 80%'), (3) Explain how this uncertainty affects the overall conclusion. The prompt includes instructions like 'For each step, state your conclusion, estimate your confidence, and explain how this uncertainty impacts the final answer.' This approach encourages the model to maintain awareness of cumulative uncertainty throughout the reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets are suitable for evaluating multi-step reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (a) Direct prompting: simply ask the question, (b) Standard chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: append 'Let's approach this step by step:' to the question, (c) Few-shot CoT: provide 2-3 examples of step-by-step reasoning before the main question.",
            "Step 3: IUP Prompt Design": "Design the IUP prompt template. Example: 'Solve this problem step by step. For each step: (1) State your intermediate conclusion, (2) Estimate your confidence in this step (e.g., 'Confidence: 80%'), (3) Explain how this uncertainty affects the overall solution. Continue until you reach the final answer.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Generate Responses": "For each problem in the datasets, generate responses using all methods (baselines and IUP). Store the full response text for each method.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (a) Task performance: accuracy on the final answer, (b) Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (c) Uncertainty correlation: Spearman correlation between reported uncertainty and correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare IUP against baselines on all metrics. Conduct additional analyses: (a) Step-wise uncertainty progression, (b) Relationship between problem difficulty and reported uncertainty, (c) Qualitative analysis of uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablations to assess the impact of different components: (a) Remove confidence estimation, (b) Remove uncertainty impact explanation, (c) Vary the granularity of confidence estimates (e.g., use 5% intervals vs. 20% intervals)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: James has 5 boxes of cookies. Each box contains 8 cookies. He eats 7 cookies. How many cookies does he have left?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "James has 33 cookies left.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard CoT)": "Q: James has 5 boxes of cookies. Each box contains 8 cookies. He eats 7 cookies. How many cookies does he have left? Let's approach this step by step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard CoT)": "Let's approach this step by step:\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies James starts with:\n   5 boxes \u00d7 8 cookies per box = 40 cookies\n2. Subtract the number of cookies James eats:\n   40 cookies - 7 cookies = 33 cookies\nTherefore, James has 33 cookies left.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IUP)": "Q: James has 5 boxes of cookies. Each box contains 8 cookies. He eats 7 cookies. How many cookies does he have left? Solve this problem step by step. For each step: (1) State your intermediate conclusion, (2) Estimate your confidence in this step (e.g., 'Confidence: 80%'), (3) Explain how this uncertainty affects the overall solution. Continue until you reach the final answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IUP)": "Step 1:\n(1) Intermediate conclusion: James starts with 5 \u00d7 8 = 40 cookies.\n(2) Confidence: 99%\n(3) Impact on uncertainty: This step involves simple multiplication, so the confidence is very high. Any uncertainty here would directly affect the final count, but it's minimal.\n\nStep 2:\n(1) Intermediate conclusion: After eating 7 cookies, James has 40 - 7 = 33 cookies left.\n(2) Confidence: 98%\n(3) Impact on uncertainty: This step involves simple subtraction. The slight decrease in confidence accounts for potential human error in counting the eaten cookies, but it's still very reliable.\n\nFinal Answer: James has 33 cookies left.\nOverall Confidence: 97%\n\nExplanation of final uncertainty: The overall confidence is slightly lower than individual steps to account for the cumulative effect of small uncertainties. However, given the simplicity of the problem, the final answer is still highly reliable.",
            "Explanation": "The IUP method provides a structured approach to uncertainty quantification, allowing for more nuanced confidence estimates and explicit reasoning about uncertainty propagation. This contrasts with the baseline methods, which either provide no uncertainty estimates (direct prompting) or don't explicitly track uncertainty across steps (standard CoT)."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IUP method doesn't significantly improve calibration or task performance, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why the method fails. This might involve categorizing different types of reasoning errors and examining how uncertainty estimates correlate with these categories. Second, we could explore variations of the IUP method, such as asking the model to revise its confidence estimates after completing all steps, or introducing a meta-cognitive step where the model reflects on its overall reasoning process. Third, we could compare IUP against other uncertainty quantification methods like Monte Carlo Dropout or ensemble methods, turning the project into a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty estimation techniques for LLMs in reasoning tasks. Finally, we could investigate how different prompting strategies affect the model's ability to estimate uncertainty, potentially uncovering insights about the relationship between reasoning strategies and uncertainty awareness in LLMs."
