    "idea_name": "Recursive Confidence Decomposition",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide single-point confidence estimates that fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties inherent in complex queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches focus on overall confidence scores or simple calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Complex queries often involve multiple sub-components with varying levels of uncertainty. We hypothesize that recursively decomposing queries and assessing confidence for each component could lead to more granular and accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Decomposition (RCD), a hierarchical prompting strategy. Given a complex query, RCD first prompts the LLM to break it down into constituent sub-questions. For each sub-question, the model is then asked to either provide an answer with a confidence score, or further decompose if uncertainty remains high. This process continues recursively until all branches reach a confidence threshold or maximum depth. Prompts include instructions like 'Decompose this question into 2-3 simpler sub-questions' and 'For each sub-question, either answer with a confidence score or further decompose if confidence is below 70%.' The final confidence estimate is computed by aggregating the hierarchical confidence scores.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RCD against flat confidence estimation techniques on complex reasoning tasks. Analyze the depth and structure of generated decomposition trees and their correlation with answer accuracy and overall uncertainty estimation."

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Decomposition: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide single-point confidence estimates that fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties inherent in complex queries. This limitation can lead to overconfident or underconfident predictions, potentially misleading users and downstream applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods primarily focus on overall confidence scores or simple calibration techniques, which may not adequately represent the multi-faceted nature of uncertainty in complex queries. We hypothesize that recursively decomposing queries and assessing confidence for each component could lead to more granular and accurate uncertainty quantification. This approach is inspired by human problem-solving strategies, where complex problems are often broken down into simpler, more manageable sub-problems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Decomposition (RCD), a hierarchical prompting strategy. Given a complex query, RCD first prompts the LLM to break it down into constituent sub-questions. For each sub-question, the model is then asked to either provide an answer with a confidence score, or further decompose if uncertainty remains high. This process continues recursively until all branches reach a confidence threshold or maximum depth. The final confidence estimate is computed by aggregating the hierarchical confidence scores.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve complex reasoning: 1) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, 2) GSM8K for multi-step math word problems, and 3) TruthfulQA for assessing model honesty in the face of uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, where the model is asked to provide an answer and a single confidence score. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation, where the model provides intermediate reasoning steps and a final confidence score.",
            "Step 3: RCD Implementation": "Implement the RCD method with the following steps: a) Query decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the question into 2-3 sub-questions. b) Sub-question confidence assessment: For each sub-question, prompt the model to either answer with a confidence score or further decompose if confidence is below 70%. c) Recursive application: Apply steps a and b recursively until reaching a maximum depth of 3 or all branches have confidence above 70%. d) Confidence aggregation: Implement a method to aggregate confidence scores from the hierarchical structure.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of RCD. For example: 'Decompose this question into 2-3 simpler sub-questions:', 'For each sub-question, either answer with a confidence score or further decompose if confidence is below 70%:', 'Aggregate the confidence scores from all sub-questions to provide an overall confidence estimate.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Answer accuracy, 2) Calibration error (difference between confidence and accuracy), 3) Brier score, 4) Average depth of decomposition tree, 5) Correlation between tree depth and task difficulty.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. b) Run the RCD method and collect results. c) Compare the performance using the defined metrics.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: 1) Compare RCD against baselines in terms of accuracy and calibration. 2) Analyze the depth and structure of generated decomposition trees and their correlation with answer accuracy and overall uncertainty estimation. 3) Investigate cases where RCD significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: The author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' also wrote which other famous novel? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird', Harper Lee, also wrote the novel 'Go Set a Watchman'. Confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Q: The author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' also wrote which other famous novel? Please decompose this question into 2-3 simpler sub-questions:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD; Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. Who is the author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\n2. What other novels did this author write?\n3. Which of these other novels is considered famous?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD; Step 2: Sub-question Confidence Assessment)": "For each sub-question, either answer with a confidence score or further decompose if confidence is below 70%:\n1. Who is the author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\n2. What other novels did this author write?\n3. Which of these other novels is considered famous?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD; Step 2: Sub-question Confidence Assessment)": "1. The author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is Harper Lee. Confidence: 95%\n2. Harper Lee wrote one other novel, 'Go Set a Watchman'. Confidence: 90%\n3. 'Go Set a Watchman' is considered famous, largely due to its connection to 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Confidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD; Step 3: Confidence Aggregation)": "Based on the sub-question answers and confidence scores, provide the final answer to the original question and an overall confidence estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD; Step 3: Confidence Aggregation)": "A: The author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird', Harper Lee, also wrote the famous novel 'Go Set a Watchman'. Overall confidence estimate: 88% (This is calculated by averaging the confidence scores of the sub-questions, as they all contribute equally to the final answer.)",
            "explanation": "RCD provides a more nuanced confidence estimation by breaking down the question into sub-components and assessing confidence for each part. This allows for a more granular understanding of where uncertainty lies within the reasoning process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RCD method doesn't significantly improve over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine the quality and relevance of the generated sub-questions, analyze whether the decomposition process itself introduces errors or biases, and investigate if certain types of questions benefit more from decomposition than others. Additionally, we could explore alternative aggregation methods for the hierarchical confidence scores, such as weighted averages based on the importance of each sub-question. Another direction could be to combine RCD with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to see if there are synergistic effects. Finally, we could turn this into an analysis paper by offering insights into how LLMs approach complex reasoning tasks and where their uncertainties lie, which could inform future model development and prompt engineering strategies."
