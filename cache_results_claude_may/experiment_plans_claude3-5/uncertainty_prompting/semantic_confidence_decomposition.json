    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide a single confidence score for complex outputs, failing to capture nuanced uncertainties associated with different components of their response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most confidence estimation techniques focus on producing a single scalar value for the entire output.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down confidence estimates into semantically meaningful components, we can provide users with more actionable uncertainty information and potentially improve the model's overall calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Confidence Decomposition (SCD), a prompting strategy that guides the model to decompose its confidence estimate across different semantic aspects of its response. The process involves: 1) Generate an initial response to a query. 2) Prompt the model to identify key semantic components of its answer (e.g., entities, relations, temporal aspects, causal links). 3) For each component, provide a confidence estimate and justification. 4) Synthesize component-level confidences into an overall confidence score, explaining how different components contribute to the total uncertainty. 5) Optionally, prompt for strategies to improve confidence in low-scoring components. SCD prompts are designed to encourage fine-grained uncertainty analysis, helping the model and users better understand the sources of potential errors.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SCD against holistic confidence estimation methods on tasks with naturally decomposable structures, such as multi-hop question answering and complex information extraction. Assess both the quality of component-level calibration and its impact on overall confidence estimation accuracy."

        "Title": "Semantic Confidence Decomposition: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single confidence score for complex outputs, failing to capture nuanced uncertainties associated with different components of their response. This oversimplification can lead to misinterpretation of model reliability and hinder effective human-AI collaboration.",
        "Motivation": "Existing confidence estimation techniques typically focus on producing a single scalar value for the entire output, which is insufficient for complex, multi-faceted responses. By breaking down confidence estimates into semantically meaningful components, we can provide users with more actionable uncertainty information and potentially improve the model's overall calibration. This approach is inspired by human expert behavior, where confidence is often expressed differently for various aspects of a response.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Confidence Decomposition (SCD), a prompting strategy that guides the model to decompose its confidence estimate across different semantic aspects of its response. The process involves five steps: 1) Generate an initial response to a query. 2) Prompt the model to identify key semantic components of its answer (e.g., entities, relations, temporal aspects, causal links). 3) For each component, provide a confidence estimate and justification. 4) Synthesize component-level confidences into an overall confidence score, explaining how different components contribute to the total uncertainty. 5) Optionally, prompt for strategies to improve confidence in low-scoring components.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use three datasets that naturally contain decomposable structures: 1) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, 2) FEVER for fact verification, and 3) TimeQA for temporal reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for its answer. 2) Calibrated confidence: use temperature scaling to calibrate the model's confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: SCD Implementation": "Implement the SCD method using the following prompts for each step: 1) 'Answer the following question: [QUESTION]' 2) 'Identify the key semantic components in your answer.' 3) 'For each component, provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification.' 4) 'Synthesize an overall confidence score based on the component scores. Explain your reasoning.' 5) 'Suggest strategies to improve confidence for low-scoring components.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for overall calibration. 2) Component-level ECE for calibration of individual semantic components. 3) Spearman's rank correlation between component confidences and their correctness. 4) Human evaluation of the usefulness and interpretability of SCD outputs.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Generate answers and confidence scores using baseline methods. 2) Generate answers, component-level confidences, and overall confidences using SCD. 3) Compute evaluation metrics for both baseline and SCD methods. 4) Conduct human evaluation on a subset of outputs.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare SCD performance against baselines across different datasets and models. 2) Analyze patterns in component-level confidences and their relationship to answer correctness. 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of suggested improvement strategies for low-confidence components."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2010?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2010 was Kathryn Bigelow for 'The Hurt Locker'. Confidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SCD Step 1)": "Q: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2010?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SCD Step 1)": "The director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2010 was Kathryn Bigelow for 'The Hurt Locker'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SCD Step 2)": "Identify the key semantic components in your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SCD Step 2)": "1. Director: Kathryn Bigelow\n2. Film: The Hurt Locker\n3. Award: Academy Award for Best Picture\n4. Year: 2010",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SCD Step 3)": "For each component, provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SCD Step 3)": "1. Director (Kathryn Bigelow): 95 - I'm highly confident about this as Kathryn Bigelow's win was historic, being the first woman to win Best Director.\n2. Film (The Hurt Locker): 90 - I'm very confident about this, as it was a notable win, but there's a small chance I might be confusing it with another year.\n3. Award (Academy Award for Best Picture): 100 - This is directly stated in the question, so I'm certain about this component.\n4. Year (2010): 80 - I'm reasonably confident about the year, but there's a possibility I might be off by a year or two.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SCD Step 4)": "Synthesize an overall confidence score based on the component scores. Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SCD Step 4)": "Overall confidence: 88\nReasoning: The overall confidence is a weighted average of the component scores, with more weight given to the crucial elements (director and film). The high confidence in the director (95) and film (90) contribute significantly to the overall score. The perfect confidence in the award type (100) also boosts the score. However, the slightly lower confidence in the year (80) pulls the overall score down a bit, as temporal accuracy is important for this question. The synthesized score of 88 reflects high confidence in the core information while accounting for some uncertainty in the exact year.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SCD Step 5)": "Suggest strategies to improve confidence for low-scoring components.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SCD Step 5)": "To improve confidence in the year (2010), which has the lowest score:\n1. Cross-reference with a timeline of Best Picture winners to confirm the exact year.\n2. Look up Kathryn Bigelow's filmography and awards history to verify the year of her Best Director win.\n3. Check news archives from the time period to find contemporary reports of the award ceremony.\n4. Verify if any significant events or other films from 2010 are associated with this particular Academy Awards ceremony.",
            "Explanation": "The SCD method provides a more nuanced and interpretable confidence assessment compared to the baseline. It breaks down the confidence into semantic components, allowing users to understand which parts of the answer are more or less certain. The overall confidence is then synthesized with clear reasoning, and strategies for improvement are suggested for the least confident component."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SCD method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where SCD fails, focusing on understanding why decomposition doesn't improve calibration. This could lead to insights about LLM reasoning processes. 2) Investigate whether SCD performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could inform targeted applications of the method. 3) Explore variations of the SCD method, such as iterative refinement of component confidences or incorporating external knowledge sources for verification. 4) Shift focus to analyzing how different prompting strategies affect confidence estimation, using SCD as one of several compared methods. This could result in a paper on prompt engineering for improved calibration in LLMs."
