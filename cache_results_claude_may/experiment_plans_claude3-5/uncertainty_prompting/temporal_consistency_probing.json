    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide inconsistent answers and confidence estimates when queried about the same information at different points in time, indicating poor calibration of their uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing calibration methods focus on static, one-time confidence estimation without considering temporal dynamics.",
        "Motivation": "By probing the model's consistency over simulated time periods, we can better gauge its true uncertainty and calibrate its confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing (TCP), which involves a series of time-shifted prompts to assess the model's confidence stability. The process begins with a base query, then generates multiple variants representing the same question asked at different points in time (e.g., 'What will be the population of New York in 2025?' vs 'What was the projected population of New York for 2025 back in 2020?'). For each variant, we prompt the model to provide an answer, confidence score, and explanation of how time affects its certainty. We then analyze the consistency and variation in these responses to derive a calibrated confidence score. Additionally, we prompt the model to reflect on and explain any inconsistencies in its answers across time, using this meta-cognitive output to further refine the uncertainty estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TCP on a curated dataset of time-sensitive queries spanning various domains (e.g., current events, scientific predictions, historical knowledge). We'll compare it against standard static confidence estimation methods, measuring improvements in calibration consistency and the model's ability to reason about time-based uncertainty."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Probing: Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Time-Shifted Prompts",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inconsistent answers and confidence estimates when queried about the same information at different points in time, indicating poor calibration of their uncertainty estimates. This inconsistency undermines the reliability of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is essential.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods primarily focus on static, one-time confidence estimation without considering temporal dynamics. By probing the model's consistency over simulated time periods, we can better gauge its true uncertainty and calibrate its confidence estimates. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to reason about time and meta-cognition, potentially leading to more robust and reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing (TCP), which involves a series of time-shifted prompts to assess the model's confidence stability. The process begins with a base query, then generates multiple variants representing the same question asked at different points in time. For each variant, we prompt the model to provide an answer, confidence score, and explanation of how time affects its certainty. We then analyze the consistency and variation in these responses to derive a calibrated confidence score. Additionally, we prompt the model to reflect on and explain any inconsistencies in its answers across time, using this meta-cognitive output to further refine the uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a curated dataset of time-sensitive queries spanning various domains (e.g., current events, scientific predictions, historical knowledge). Each query should have a ground truth answer and be amenable to time-shifting. Aim for a diverse set of 1000-2000 queries.",
            "Step 2: Time-Shifted Prompt Generation": "For each base query, generate 5 time-shifted variants. For example, if the base query is 'What will be the population of New York in 2025?', variants could include 'What was the projected population of New York for 2025 back in 2020?' and 'Looking back from 2030, what was New York's population in 2025?'",
            "Step 3: Baseline Confidence Estimation": "Implement standard static confidence estimation methods as baselines. These should include: (1) Direct prompting for confidence scores, (2) Calibrated softmax probabilities, and (3) Monte Carlo Dropout if applicable to the chosen LLM.",
            "Step 4: TCP Implementation": "For each query and its variants: (1) Prompt the LLM for an answer, confidence score (0-100%), and explanation of time's impact on certainty. (2) Prompt the LLM to reflect on and explain any inconsistencies across its time-shifted answers. (3) Calculate a calibrated confidence score based on the consistency of answers and the model's meta-cognitive explanations.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API as the primary models for evaluation. If resources allow, also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare TCP against baseline methods using the following metrics: (1) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), (2) Brier score, (3) Consistency across time-shifted queries, and (4) Correlation between calibrated confidence and answer correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of: (1) How TCP performance varies across different types of queries and time scales, (2) The quality and usefulness of the model's explanations about time's impact on certainty, (3) Common patterns in the model's meta-cognitive reflections on inconsistencies.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablations to assess the impact of: (1) Number of time-shifted variants used, (2) Inclusion/exclusion of meta-cognitive reflection step, (3) Different methods of aggregating time-shifted responses into a final calibrated score."

            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "What will be the population of Tokyo in 2030?",

                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single point estimate with a high confidence score, without considering potential uncertainties over time."

                "Base Query": "What will be the population of Tokyo in 2030?",

                ],
                "Sample Outputs": [
                    "Based on 2020 projections, Tokyo's population in 2030 was expected to be around 37 million. Confidence: 70%. Time impact: Projections from 2020 have higher uncertainty due to unforeseen events and long-term trends.",
                    "As of 2025, Tokyo's population in 2030 is projected to be about 36.8 million. Confidence: 80%. Time impact: Closer to the target year, projections become more accurate with updated data.",
                    "Looking back from 2035, Tokyo's population in 2030 was 36.2 million. Confidence: 95%. Time impact: Historical data allows for high confidence in past population figures.",
                    "In 2028, the most recent projection for Tokyo's 2030 population is 36.5 million. Confidence: 85%. Time impact: Very recent projections are more likely to be accurate, but some uncertainty remains.",
                    "From 2040, we know that 2030 projections for Tokyo were slightly overestimated. The actual population was 36.1 million. Confidence: 100%. Time impact: With hindsight, we have perfect information about past populations."
                ],
                "Meta-cognitive Reflection": "Analyzing my responses across different time perspectives, I notice a trend of increasing confidence as we move closer to or beyond the target year of 2030. The population estimates also show a slight downward revision over time, from 37 million in earlier projections to 36.1 million in hindsight. This suggests that earlier projections may have overestimated population growth. The inconsistency in my confidence levels reflects the changing nature of uncertainty with time - projections further from the target year are inherently less certain. In future responses, I should be more conservative with high confidence scores for long-term projections.",
                "Calibrated Output": "Based on temporal consistency analysis, the population of Tokyo in 2030 is projected to be 36.3 million, with a calibrated confidence of 75%. This estimate accounts for the observed trend of slight downward revisions in projections over time and the inherent uncertainty in long-term population forecasts.",
                "Explanation": "TCP provides a more nuanced and likely better-calibrated confidence estimate by considering multiple time perspectives and the model's own reflection on its inconsistencies. The final output acknowledges the uncertainty inherent in long-term projections while still providing a useful estimate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCP method does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of why temporal consistency fails to improve calibration, potentially uncovering interesting insights about how LLMs reason about time and uncertainty. (2) Explore alternative ways of leveraging the time-shifted responses, such as using them to train a small calibration model on top of the LLM outputs. (3) Investigate whether TCP is more effective for certain types of queries or time scales, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the method. (4) Analyze the quality and consistency of the model's explanations about time's impact on certainty, which could provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning even if it doesn't directly improve calibration. (5) Explore combining TCP with other calibration methods, such as temperature scaling or ensemble techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results."
