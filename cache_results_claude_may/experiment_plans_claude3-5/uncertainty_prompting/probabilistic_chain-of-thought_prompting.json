        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on post-hoc analysis or external calibration, which may not capture the model's inherent uncertainty during the reasoning process.",
        "Existing Methods": "Standard chain-of-thought prompting and few-shot prompting are common baselines for complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we can encourage LLMs to express uncertainty at each step of their reasoning process, potentially leading to more accurate final confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Chain-of-Thought (PCoT) prompting, where the model is instructed to assign probabilities to each intermediate reasoning step. The prompt includes examples of reasoning chains with probability estimates for each step, encouraging the model to do the same for new problems. For instance: 'Step 1 (90% confident): The problem involves calculating the area of a circle. Step 2 (95% confident): The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2. Step 3 (80% confident): The radius given is 5 cm...'. The final answer includes an overall confidence score derived from these step-wise probabilities.",

        "Title": "Probabilistic Chain-of-Thought (PCoT) Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on post-hoc analysis or external calibration, which may not capture the model's inherent uncertainty during the reasoning process. This limits the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs, especially in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like standard chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot prompting have shown promise in improving LLM performance on complex tasks, but they don't explicitly address uncertainty quantification. Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we propose a method that encourages LLMs to express uncertainty at each step of their reasoning process. This approach could lead to more accurate final confidence estimates and provide insights into where uncertainty arises during reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Chain-of-Thought (PCoT) prompting, where the model is instructed to assign probabilities to each intermediate reasoning step. The prompt includes examples of reasoning chains with probability estimates for each step, encouraging the model to do the same for new problems. For instance: 'Step 1 (90% confident): The problem involves calculating the area of a circle. Step 2 (95% confident): The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2. Step 3 (80% confident): The radius given is 5 cm...'. The final answer includes an overall confidence score derived from these step-wise probabilities.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use two datasets: (1) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and (2) ScienceQA for scientific question-answering. These datasets cover a range of reasoning complexities and domain knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Prompts": "We will implement three baseline prompting methods: (a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the question. (b) Standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Append 'Let's approach this step by step:' to the question. (c) Few-shot prompting: Provide 2-3 examples of question-answer pairs before the target question.",
            "Step 4: PCoT Prompt Construction": "Construct the PCoT prompt by including 2-3 examples of reasoning chains with probability estimates for each step. The prompt should instruct the model to provide step-wise confidence estimates and an overall confidence score. Example: 'For each step in your reasoning, provide a confidence percentage. At the end, give an overall confidence score for your answer.'",
            "Step 5: Data Processing": "For each dataset, randomly select 100 questions for evaluation. Ensure a balanced distribution of difficulty levels if such information is available.",
            "Step 6: Model Querying": "For each question in the evaluation set, query the models using all four prompting methods (three baselines and PCoT). Store the full model outputs for later analysis.",
            "Step 7: Answer Extraction": "Develop a script to extract the final answers and confidence scores from the model outputs. For PCoT, also extract the step-wise confidence estimates.",
            "Step 8: Performance Evaluation": "Calculate the following metrics: (a) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. (b) Calibration error: Difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. (c) Brier score: Measures both calibration and sharpness of probabilistic predictions.",
            "Step 9: Uncertainty Analysis": "For PCoT outputs, analyze the relationship between step-wise confidence estimates and overall accuracy. Identify patterns in how uncertainty propagates through the reasoning chain.",
            "Step 10: Comparative Analysis": "Compare the performance of PCoT against the baseline methods across all metrics. Use statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to determine if the differences are significant.",
            "Step 11: Error Analysis": "Manually review a subset of incorrect answers to identify common failure modes and how they relate to the expressed uncertainties.",
            "Step 12: Ablation Study": "Experiment with variations of PCoT, such as changing the number of example steps or altering the way confidence scores are aggregated, to understand the impact of these design choices."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: If a rectangle has a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm, what is its area?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The area of the rectangle is 50 square centimeters.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard CoT)": "Q: If a rectangle has a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm, what is its area? Let's approach this step by step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard CoT)": "Let's approach this step by step:\n1. We know that the formula for the area of a rectangle is length \u00d7 width.\n2. The length of the rectangle is 10 cm.\n3. The width of the rectangle is 5 cm.\n4. So, we multiply 10 cm by 5 cm: 10 cm \u00d7 5 cm = 50 cm\u00b2\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 50 square centimeters.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PCoT)": "Q: If a rectangle has a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm, what is its area? Provide your reasoning step by step, including a confidence percentage for each step. At the end, give an overall confidence score for your answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PCoT)": "Let's solve this step by step:\n1. (100% confident) The formula for the area of a rectangle is length \u00d7 width.\n2. (100% confident) The given length of the rectangle is 10 cm.\n3. (100% confident) The given width of the rectangle is 5 cm.\n4. (99% confident) Multiplying these values: 10 cm \u00d7 5 cm = 50 cm\u00b2\n5. (98% confident) The final answer is 50 square centimeters.\n\nOverall confidence: 98%\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 50 square centimeters.",
            "Explanation": "The PCoT method provides a more detailed breakdown of the reasoning process, with confidence estimates for each step. This allows for better understanding of where potential uncertainties might arise in the problem-solving process. The overall confidence score gives a quantitative measure of the model's certainty in its final answer, which is not present in the baseline methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the PCoT method doesn't show significant improvements over the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the step-wise confidences to gain insights into where and why the model expresses uncertainty, potentially revealing interesting patterns about LLM reasoning. Second, we could experiment with different ways of aggregating step-wise confidences into an overall score, which might lead to better calibration. Third, we could investigate how PCoT performs on different types of reasoning tasks, potentially uncovering task-specific benefits. Lastly, we could explore combining PCoT with other prompting techniques or external knowledge sources to see if this hybrid approach yields better results. These analyses could still provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning and uncertainty, even if the original hypothesis isn't fully supported."
