        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on direct prompting or analysis of model internals to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically perturbing the semantic content of questions, we can probe the model's robustness and sensitivity to changes, providing insight into its true uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Perturbation for Uncertainty Quantification (SPUQ). Given an initial question, we use the model itself to generate a series of semantically perturbed versions. These perturbations include synonym substitution, rephrasing, adding or removing context, and introducing potential misconceptions. The model answers each perturbed question and provides a confidence score. We then analyze the consistency and variation in answers and confidence across perturbations. High consistency indicates low uncertainty, while significant variations suggest higher uncertainty. The model is then prompted to reflect on these variations, providing a final calibrated uncertainty estimate and explanation. This method allows for uncertainty quantification without requiring the model to directly assess its own confidence, instead inferring it from response stability.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SPUQ against baseline confidence estimation methods on diverse QA tasks. Evaluate how well SPUQ-derived uncertainty correlates with answer correctness and human-judged question difficulty. Analyze the types of perturbations that most effectively reveal model uncertainty across different domains."

        "Title": "SPUQ: Semantic Perturbation for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas of uncertainty. This overconfidence can result in the propagation of misinformation and unreliable decision-making in critical applications. Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are limited in their ability to capture the nuanced uncertainties across different semantic variations of the same question.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically rely on direct prompting or analysis of model internals, which may not fully capture the model's true uncertainty across different semantic formulations of the same query. By systematically perturbing the semantic content of questions, we can probe the model's robustness and sensitivity to changes, providing deeper insight into its true uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to generate and respond to semantically varied inputs, potentially offering a more comprehensive and nuanced measure of uncertainty without requiring access to model internals or extensive retraining.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Perturbation for Uncertainty Quantification (SPUQ), a novel method that uses the LLM itself to generate and evaluate semantically perturbed versions of an initial question. The process involves the following steps: 1) Given an initial question, use the LLM to generate a series of semantically perturbed versions. These perturbations include synonym substitution, rephrasing, adding or removing context, and introducing potential misconceptions. 2) The LLM answers each perturbed question and provides a confidence score. 3) We analyze the consistency and variation in answers and confidence across perturbations. High consistency indicates low uncertainty, while significant variations suggest higher uncertainty. 4) The LLM is then prompted to reflect on these variations, providing a final calibrated uncertainty estimate and explanation. This method allows for uncertainty quantification without requiring the model to directly assess its own confidence, instead inferring it from response stability across semantic variations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of question-answering datasets to evaluate SPUQ: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and potential misinformation, 2) ARC-Challenge for science reasoning, and 3) Strategy-QA for multi-step reasoning. These datasets cover a range of difficulty levels and domain knowledge, allowing us to test SPUQ's effectiveness across different types of queries.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods for comparison: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Ensemble method: Generate multiple answers using different temperature settings and calculate the variance as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SPUQ Implementation": "Implement the SPUQ method with the following sub-steps: a) Perturbation generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 5 semantic perturbations for each question. Example prompt: 'Generate 5 different versions of the following question, varying the wording, context, or perspective: [ORIGINAL QUESTION]' b) Answer generation: For each perturbation and the original question, generate an answer and confidence score. c) Consistency analysis: Implement a function to calculate answer consistency across perturbations using string similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU score) and variance in confidence scores. d) Reflection and calibration: Prompt the LLM to analyze the variations in answers and provide a final calibrated uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. For comparison, we will also run a subset of experiments using GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-v1.3 to assess the generalizability of SPUQ across different LLMs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate SPUQ and baselines: 1) Calibration error: Compare model uncertainty estimates with actual error rates. 2) Spearman's rank correlation: Measure how well the uncertainty estimates correlate with human-judged question difficulty. 3) AUROC for selective prediction: Assess the model's ability to abstain from answering when uncertain.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run SPUQ and baseline methods on all datasets using the selected models. Collect uncertainty estimates, answers, and perturbations for analysis.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: 1) Compare SPUQ's performance against baselines using the defined metrics. 2) Analyze which types of semantic perturbations are most effective at revealing model uncertainty across different question types. 3) Investigate how SPUQ's performance varies across different domains and reasoning types. 4) Examine cases where SPUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SPUQ; Step 1: Perturbation Generation)": "Generate 5 different versions of the following question, varying the wording, context, or perspective: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SPUQ; Step 1: Perturbation Generation)": "1. Which city serves as the political and administrative center of France?\n2. If you were to visit the Eiffel Tower, in what capital city would you find yourself?\n3. What is the most populous city in France, also known for being its capital?\n4. In French politics, which city is referred to as the seat of government?\n5. Historically, what has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SPUQ; Step 2: Answer Generation)": "Q: Which city serves as the political and administrative center of France? Provide an answer and a confidence score from 0-100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SPUQ; Step 2: Answer Generation)": "A: Paris serves as the political and administrative center of France. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SPUQ; Step 3: Reflection and Calibration)": "Analyze the following answers to semantically similar questions about the capital of France. Provide a final calibrated uncertainty estimate and explanation:\n1. Paris (Confidence: 100)\n2. Paris (Confidence: 100)\n3. Paris (Confidence: 100)\n4. Paris (Confidence: 100)\n5. Paris (Confidence: 100)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SPUQ; Step 3: Reflection and Calibration)": "Final calibrated uncertainty estimate: Very Low (Confidence: 99/100)\n\nExplanation: The answers to all semantically similar questions consistently identify Paris as the capital of France with the highest confidence level. This uniformity across different phrasings and contexts strongly suggests that the model is very certain about this fact. The slight reduction from 100 to 99 in the final estimate acknowledges the small possibility of unforeseen errors or changes, maintaining a degree of epistemic humility.",
            "explanation": "SPUQ provides a more robust uncertainty estimate by considering multiple semantic variations of the question. While both methods correctly identify Paris with high confidence in this simple example, SPUQ's approach of generating and analyzing multiple perturbations allows for a more nuanced final estimate that considers consistency across variations. This method would be particularly valuable for more complex or ambiguous questions where different phrasings might reveal underlying uncertainties not captured by a single direct query."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SPUQ does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of how semantic variations affect LLM responses and confidence. We would focus on categorizing the types of perturbations that most effectively reveal model uncertainties and analyze patterns in how LLMs respond to subtle changes in question formulation. This could involve creating a taxonomy of semantic perturbations and their effects on model confidence across different question types and domains. Additionally, we could investigate whether certain perturbation types are more effective for specific types of questions or knowledge domains. This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and inform future approaches to uncertainty quantification and prompt engineering."
