    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often fail to express appropriate levels of uncertainty, especially in cases where they lack sufficient knowledge or when faced with ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often focus on single-pass uncertainty estimation or rely on ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "By deliberately introducing contrasting viewpoints or information, we can potentially amplify the model's expression of uncertainty in cases where genuine ambiguity or knowledge gaps exist.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Uncertainty Amplification (CUA), a prompting technique that intentionally introduces conflicting information or perspectives to the model. The process involves: 1) Initial query processing, 2) Generation of multiple, potentially conflicting responses, 3) Explicit prompting to compare and contrast these responses, 4) Guided analysis of the sources of disagreement, and 5) Synthesis of a final response with calibrated uncertainty expression. This method aims to make the model more aware of potential ambiguities or knowledge limitations, leading to more appropriate expression of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CUA against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods on tasks involving ambiguous queries, incomplete information, and queries requiring specialized knowledge. Measure performance using calibration scores, uncertainty-adjusted accuracy, and human evaluation of response appropriateness."

        "Title": "Contrastive Uncertainty Amplification: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often fail to express appropriate levels of uncertainty, especially in cases where they lack sufficient knowledge or when faced with ambiguous queries. This can lead to overconfident responses in situations where the model should express doubt or acknowledge limitations in its knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in language models often rely on single-pass estimation or ensemble methods, which may not fully capture the nuances of model uncertainty. By deliberately introducing contrasting viewpoints or information, we can potentially amplify the model's expression of uncertainty in cases where genuine ambiguity or knowledge gaps exist. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to identify and highlight areas of uncertainty, potentially leading to more calibrated and reliable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Uncertainty Amplification (CUA), a prompting technique that intentionally introduces conflicting information or perspectives to the model. The process involves five steps: 1) Initial query processing, 2) Generation of multiple, potentially conflicting responses, 3) Explicit prompting to compare and contrast these responses, 4) Guided analysis of the sources of disagreement, and 5) Synthesis of a final response with calibrated uncertainty expression. This method aims to make the model more aware of potential ambiguities or knowledge limitations, leading to more appropriate expression of uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets that cover ambiguous queries, incomplete information scenarios, and queries requiring specialized knowledge. We will use a combination of datasets: TruthfulQA for ambiguous ethical questions, AmbigQA for inherently ambiguous queries, and a subset of TriviaQA for specialized knowledge questions. Ensure a balanced distribution of question types.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the question. b) Temperature sampling: Generate multiple responses with different temperature settings. c) Few-shot CoT with uncertainty: Provide examples of responses with explicit uncertainty statements.",
            "Step 3: CUA Implementation": "Implement the Contrastive Uncertainty Amplification method: a) Initial query processing: Present the question to the model. b) Generate conflicting responses: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 potentially conflicting answers. c) Comparison and contrast: Prompt the model to explicitly compare and contrast the generated responses. d) Disagreement analysis: Guide the model to analyze sources of disagreement. e) Final synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize a final response with calibrated uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. These models provide state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration score: Measure how well the model's expressed uncertainty aligns with its actual accuracy. b) Uncertainty-adjusted accuracy: Assess the model's accuracy while accounting for its expressed uncertainty. c) Human evaluation: Recruit annotators to rate the appropriateness of the model's uncertainty expression on a subset of responses.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments for each method (baselines and CUA) on the prepared dataset. Generate responses for all questions using each method. Ensure consistent API parameters (e.g., max_tokens, temperature) across methods where applicable.",
            "Step 7: Results Analysis": "Compute evaluation metrics for each method. Perform statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to determine if CUA significantly outperforms baselines. Analyze performance across different question types to identify where CUA is most effective.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in the CUA process. This includes: a) Varying the number of conflicting responses generated. b) Removing the explicit comparison step. c) Skipping the disagreement analysis step.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Manually review a subset of responses where CUA performs particularly well or poorly. Identify patterns or characteristics of questions where CUA is most effective or ineffective."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of the United States?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUA Step 1: Initial Query)": "Q: What is the capital of the United States?",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUA Step 2: Generate Conflicting Responses)": "1. The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C.\n2. The capital of the United States is New York City, as it's the largest and most influential city.\n3. The United States has no official capital, as the Constitution doesn't specify one.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUA Step 3: Compare and Contrast)": "Compare and contrast the following responses to the question 'What is the capital of the United States?': [Insert generated responses]",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUA Step 3: Compare and Contrast)": "The responses differ significantly:\n1. States Washington, D.C. as the capital, which is the widely accepted answer.\n2. Claims New York City is the capital, citing its size and influence, which is incorrect.\n3. Argues that there is no official capital, which is technically incorrect but raises an interesting point about constitutional specification.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUA Step 4: Analyze Disagreement)": "Analyze the sources of disagreement in the responses to 'What is the capital of the United States?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUA Step 4: Analyze Disagreement)": "The disagreement stems from:\n1. Confusion between political capital and economic/cultural importance.\n2. Misunderstanding of constitutional law and historical context.\n3. Potential conflation of 'official' designation with practical function.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUA Step 5: Final Synthesis)": "Synthesize a final response with calibrated uncertainty for 'What is the capital of the United States?', considering the previous analysis.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUA Step 5: Final Synthesis)": "The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C. This is the correct answer with high certainty. While the Constitution doesn't explicitly name a capital, Washington, D.C. was established as the seat of government in 1790. There might be some confusion because other cities like New York City have greater economic influence, but this doesn't affect D.C.'s status as the political capital.",
            "Explanation": "The CUA method leads to a more nuanced and informative response, acknowledging potential sources of confusion while still providing the correct answer with appropriate certainty. This contrasts with the baseline method, which gives a simple, potentially overconfident answer without addressing possible misconceptions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CUA method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of where and why CUA fails, potentially uncovering interesting insights about how language models process conflicting information. This could involve categorizing the types of questions where CUA underperforms and analyzing the model's intermediate outputs at each step. Second, we could explore variations of the CUA method, such as iterative refinement of conflicting viewpoints or incorporating external knowledge sources to generate more informed conflicting responses. Finally, we could shift focus to comparing how different model architectures or training regimes respond to the CUA method, potentially revealing differences in how various models handle uncertainty and conflicting information. This could provide valuable insights for future model development aimed at improving uncertainty quantification."
