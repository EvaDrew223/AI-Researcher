    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, especially when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on post-hoc calibration or fine-tuning with explicit uncertainty labels.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by adversarial training in computer vision, we propose to improve model calibration by exposing it to challenging scenarios during inference.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Prompting (CCAP), a novel prompting technique that dynamically generates adversarial inputs to challenge the model's confidence. The process involves: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score. 2) Prompt the model to create an adversarial version of the input that would likely decrease its confidence. 3) Obtain a new response and confidence score for the adversarial input. 4) Prompt the model to reconcile the two responses, explicitly reasoning about its confidence in light of the adversarial challenge. 5) Output a final response and calibrated confidence score. This method encourages the model to actively consider potential weaknesses in its knowledge and adjust its confidence accordingly.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCAP against standard prompting and existing calibration methods on diverse tasks including question-answering, fact verification, and commonsense reasoning. Measure performance using calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score."

        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, especially when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misuse of the models in critical applications. Existing calibration methods primarily focus on post-hoc adjustments or fine-tuning with explicit uncertainty labels, which may not fully leverage the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by adversarial training techniques in computer vision and the success of prompting methods in natural language processing, we propose to improve model calibration by exposing it to challenging scenarios during inference. Unlike existing methods that rely on external calibration or fine-tuning, our approach leverages the model's own reasoning abilities to generate and respond to adversarial inputs, potentially leading to more robust and better-calibrated outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Prompting (CCAP), a novel prompting technique that dynamically generates adversarial inputs to challenge the model's confidence. The process involves five steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score. 2) Prompt the model to create an adversarial version of the input that would likely decrease its confidence. 3) Obtain a new response and confidence score for the adversarial input. 4) Prompt the model to reconcile the two responses, explicitly reasoning about its confidence in light of the adversarial challenge. 5) Output a final response and calibrated confidence score. This method encourages the model to actively consider potential weaknesses in its knowledge and adjust its confidence accordingly.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for fact verification, 2) ARC-Challenge for science question answering, and 3) CommonSenseQA for commonsense reasoning. These datasets cover a range of tasks where model calibration is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models are widely used and represent state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly ask the question and request a confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: apply post-hoc calibration using temperature scaling. 3) Ensemble of MC Dropout: generate multiple outputs with dropout and use the variance as a measure of uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: CCAP Implementation": "Implement the Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Prompting method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation, b) Adversarial input generation, c) Adversarial response generation, d) Reconciliation and confidence calibration, e) Final output generation.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate all methods using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), 3) Brier Score, 4) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), and 5) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy for QA tasks).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of calibration performance across different tasks and models, 2) Qualitative analysis of generated adversarial inputs and reconciliation reasoning, 3) Impact of the number of adversarial examples on calibration performance, 4) Correlation between calibration improvement and task performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a correct answer but with very high confidence, which may not always be justified."
            },
            "CCAP Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99"
                },
                "Step 2 - Adversarial Input Generation": {
                    "Input": "Generate an adversarial version of the question 'What is the capital of France?' that might decrease the model's confidence in its answer.",
                    "Output": "Q: In an alternate history where Napoleon's empire never fell, what would likely be the capital of France today?"
                },
                "Step 3 - Adversarial Response": {
                    "Input": "In an alternate history where Napoleon's empire never fell, what would likely be the capital of France today? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                    "Output": "A: In this alternate history scenario, it's possible that Paris might still be the capital, but there's also a chance that Napoleon could have moved the capital to better suit his empire. Possible alternatives could include Lyon or even a city outside modern-day France, like Brussels or Milan, which were part of Napoleon's empire. However, without more specific details about this alternate history, it's difficult to say with certainty. Confidence score: 0.6"
                },
                "Step 4 - Reconciliation": {
                    "Input": "Consider your initial response to 'What is the capital of France?' and your response to the adversarial question. Reconcile these answers and provide a final response with a calibrated confidence score.",
                    "Output": "A: After considering both scenarios, I can confidently say that in our actual history, the capital of France is Paris. However, the adversarial question highlights that historical events can significantly impact such facts. While Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, it's important to note that capitals can change due to political, historical, or other factors. Therefore, while I'm very confident in the answer for our current reality, I should adjust my confidence slightly to account for potential changes or alternate scenarios. Final answer: The capital of France is Paris. Calibrated confidence score: 0.95"
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The CCAP method generates an adversarial input that challenges the model's initial high confidence. By considering this alternative scenario, the model is able to provide a more nuanced final response with a slightly lower, better-calibrated confidence score. This process demonstrates how CCAP can help reduce overconfidence while maintaining accurate responses."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCAP method doesn't significantly improve calibration compared to baselines, we can explore several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the generated adversarial inputs to understand if they're sufficiently challenging or relevant. If not, we could experiment with different prompting strategies for adversarial input generation, possibly incorporating task-specific knowledge or common misconceptions. Second, we could investigate the reconciliation step to see if the model is effectively using the adversarial example to calibrate its confidence. We might try more structured prompts for reconciliation or introduce intermediate steps for explicit confidence adjustment. Additionally, we could turn this into an analysis paper by conducting a thorough investigation of how different types of adversarial inputs affect model confidence across various tasks. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in handling uncertainty, even if our specific method doesn't outperform baselines."
