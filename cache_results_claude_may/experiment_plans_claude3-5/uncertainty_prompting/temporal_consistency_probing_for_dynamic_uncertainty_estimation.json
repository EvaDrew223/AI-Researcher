    "idea_name": "Temporal Consistency Probing for Dynamic Uncertainty Estimation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods often fail to capture how model confidence changes over time or with the introduction of new information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods provide static uncertainty estimates based on a single prompt or a fixed set of prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Real-world knowledge and certainty often evolve over time. By probing the model's temporal consistency, we can potentially uncover dynamic aspects of uncertainty that are missed by static methods.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a prompting strategy that simulates the passage of time and the acquisition of new information. The prompt presents a sequence of 'time steps', each introducing new, potentially conflicting information related to the original query. At each step, the model is asked to provide an updated response and confidence estimate. We analyze the pattern of changes in the model's responses and confidence estimates to derive a dynamic uncertainty score. This score reflects not just the model's final confidence, but also its stability and adaptability in the face of new information.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test our method on a specially constructed dataset of time-sensitive queries (e.g., evolving news stories, scientific discoveries). Compare against static uncertainty estimation methods, evaluating both the accuracy of the final estimates and the ability to capture meaningful uncertainty dynamics."

        "Title": "Dynamic Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models via Temporal Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often fail to capture how model confidence changes over time or with the introduction of new information. This limitation hinders our understanding of model reliability in dynamic, real-world scenarios where knowledge and certainty evolve.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically provide static uncertainty estimates based on a single prompt or a fixed set of prompts. However, real-world knowledge and certainty often evolve over time. By probing the model's temporal consistency, we can potentially uncover dynamic aspects of uncertainty that are missed by static methods. This approach is inspired by how human confidence in knowledge changes as new information is acquired or as time passes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a temporal prompting strategy that simulates the passage of time and the acquisition of new information. The method involves presenting a sequence of 'time steps' to the model, each introducing new, potentially conflicting information related to the original query. At each step, the model is asked to provide an updated response and confidence estimate. We then analyze the pattern of changes in the model's responses and confidence estimates to derive a dynamic uncertainty score. This score reflects not just the model's final confidence, but also its stability and adaptability in the face of new information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Construct a dataset of time-sensitive queries, focusing on evolving news stories, scientific discoveries, and historical events with changing interpretations. For each query, create a sequence of 5-7 'time steps', each introducing new information. Ensure a mix of consistent and conflicting information across time steps.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement static uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: (1) Softmax probabilities, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, (3) Ensemble methods.",
            "Step 3: Temporal Prompting Implementation": "Develop the temporal prompting strategy. For each query, construct a series of prompts that introduce new information at each time step. Include instructions for the model to update its response and provide a confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each query in the dataset: (a) Apply baseline methods to get static uncertainty estimates. (b) Apply temporal prompting method, collecting model responses and confidence estimates at each time step.",
            "Step 6: Dynamic Uncertainty Score Calculation": "Develop an algorithm to calculate the dynamic uncertainty score based on the temporal prompting results. Consider factors such as response stability, confidence trajectory, and sensitivity to new information.",
            "Step 7: Performance Evaluation": "Compare the dynamic uncertainty scores with static baseline methods. Evaluate based on: (1) Correlation with human judgments of uncertainty, (2) Ability to predict model errors, (3) Sensitivity to genuinely uncertain scenarios.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, focusing on: (1) Patterns of uncertainty change over time, (2) Types of queries where dynamic uncertainty estimation outperforms static methods, (3) Impact of conflicting information on model confidence."

            "Example 1: Baseline Method Failure": {
                "Query": "What is the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "What is the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Baseline Output": "As of now, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing but many countries have made significant progress in controlling its spread through vaccination programs and public health measures. However, new variants continue to emerge, and global vaccination efforts are uneven. Confidence score: 85",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single, high-confidence answer without accounting for the rapidly changing nature of the pandemic situation."

                    "Step 1: It's January 2020. What is known about the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                    "Step 2: It's March 2020. The WHO has declared a global pandemic. What is the current status of COVID-19? Update your answer and confidence score.",
                    "Step 3: It's December 2020. Vaccines have been developed and are beginning to be distributed. What is the current status of the pandemic? Update your answer and confidence score.",
                    "Step 4: It's mid-2021. New variants like Delta are emerging. What is the current status of the pandemic? Update your answer and confidence score.",
                    "Step 5: It's early 2023. Many countries have lifted restrictions, but new variants continue to circulate. What is the current status of the pandemic? Provide your final answer and confidence score."

                "Temporal Prompting Output": [
                    "Step 1: A novel coronavirus has been identified in Wuhan, China, causing a cluster of pneumonia cases. Little is known about its transmission or severity. Confidence score: 40",
                    "Step 2: COVID-19 has spread globally, causing significant mortality and straining healthcare systems. Many countries are implementing lockdowns and other containment measures. Confidence score: 75",
                    "Step 3: Multiple vaccines have shown high efficacy in clinical trials and are being distributed, starting with high-risk populations. However, the pandemic continues to cause significant global impact. Confidence score: 85",
                    "Step 4: Vaccination efforts are progressing in many countries, but unevenly globally. The emergence of the more transmissible Delta variant is causing concern and some regions are seeing new waves of infections. Confidence score: 80",
                    "Step 5: The pandemic is in a different phase, with many countries treating COVID-19 as endemic. Vaccination and prior infections have built up population immunity, but new variants continue to circulate. The situation varies greatly by region. Confidence score: 70"
                ],
                "Explanation": "The temporal prompting method captures the evolving nature of the pandemic, showing how the model's understanding and confidence change with new information. The final confidence score is lower than the baseline, reflecting the ongoing uncertainties and regional variations in the pandemic status."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed temporal prompting method doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of how different types of information (e.g., consistent vs. conflicting) affect model confidence over time. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases. Second, we could explore combining our temporal approach with existing uncertainty estimation methods, creating a hybrid model that leverages both static and dynamic uncertainty signals. Additionally, we could investigate whether the temporal prompting method performs better on specific types of queries or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. Finally, we could use our findings to develop a new benchmark dataset for evaluating dynamic uncertainty estimation in language models, contributing a valuable resource to the research community."
