        "Problem": "LLMs often display overconfidence in their answers, failing to recognize potential flaws or alternative viewpoints that could undermine their certainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on the model's initial confidence estimate without actively challenging it.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to generate potential counterarguments to its own reasoning, we can uncover hidden uncertainties and produce more robust confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Probing (ACP), a multi-step prompting approach that: 1) Obtains an initial answer and confidence estimate from the LLM. 2) Prompts the model to generate potential flaws or counterarguments to its own reasoning. 3) Asks the model to defend against these counterarguments and reassess its confidence. 4) Iterates this process, gradually refining the confidence estimate. 5) Aggregates the confidence scores from each iteration to produce a final calibrated estimate. The prompts are designed to encourage honest self-critique and thorough exploration of potential uncertainties.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ACP against standard confidence estimation techniques on datasets requiring careful reasoning and consideration of multiple viewpoints, such as argument evaluation tasks or ethical dilemma datasets. Measure improvements in calibration metrics and the model's ability to identify genuine uncertainties in its reasoning."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Probing: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence in their answers, failing to recognize potential flaws or alternative viewpoints that could undermine their certainty. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on the model's initial confidence estimate without actively challenging it. These approaches fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties that may arise from complex reasoning tasks. By prompting the model to generate potential counterarguments to its own reasoning, we can uncover hidden uncertainties and produce more robust confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human critical thinking processes, where considering alternative viewpoints often leads to more nuanced and well-calibrated judgments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Probing (ACP), a multi-step prompting approach that iteratively refines the model's confidence estimate. The steps are as follows: 1) Obtain an initial answer and confidence estimate from the LLM. 2) Prompt the model to generate potential flaws or counterarguments to its own reasoning. 3) Ask the model to defend against these counterarguments and reassess its confidence. 4) Iterate this process, gradually refining the confidence estimate. 5) Aggregate the confidence scores from each iteration to produce a final calibrated estimate. The prompts are designed to encourage honest self-critique and thorough exploration of potential uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that require careful reasoning and consideration of multiple viewpoints. We will use: a) The Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT) dataset, which contains 2000 examples of argument evaluation. b) The Moral Scenarios dataset, containing 500 ethical dilemmas. c) A subset of 1000 examples from the TruthfulQA dataset, which tests the model's ability to avoid false statements.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models are widely used and have shown strong performance on various reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Standard confidence estimation: Simply ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. b) Temperature scaling: Generate multiple samples with different temperature settings and use the variance in predictions as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: ACP Implementation": "Implement the Adversarial Confidence Probing method with the following steps: a) Initial answer generation: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide an initial confidence score (0-100). b) Counterargument generation: Prompt the model to generate 3 potential flaws or counterarguments to its reasoning. c) Defense and reassessment: Ask the model to defend against each counterargument and provide an updated confidence score. d) Iteration: Repeat steps b and c for 3 iterations. e) Aggregation: Calculate the final confidence score as the average of all confidence scores across iterations.",
            "Step 5: Prompt Engineering": "Design effective prompts for each step of the ACP process. For example: a) Initial answer: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100) for your answer: [QUESTION]' b) Counterargument generation: 'Generate 3 potential flaws or counterarguments to your previous reasoning:' c) Defense and reassessment: 'Defend against the following counterargument and provide an updated confidence score (0-100): [COUNTERARGUMENT]'",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. b) Brier Score: Assesses the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): Evaluates the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. b) Run the ACP method and collect results. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and ACP methods.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare the performance of ACP against baselines using the evaluation metrics. b) Analyze how confidence scores change across iterations in the ACP method. c) Identify patterns in the types of counterarguments generated and their impact on confidence scores. d) Examine cases where ACP significantly improves or worsens performance compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Is it ethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo without informing the patient? Provide your answer and a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: It is generally considered unethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo without informing the patient. This practice violates the principle of informed consent, which is a cornerstone of medical ethics. Patients have the right to know what they are being given and to make informed decisions about their treatment. However, there are some rare cases where the use of placebos might be justified, such as in clinical trials where patients are aware that they might receive a placebo. Confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: Is it ethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo without informing the patient? Provide your answer and a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "A: It is generally considered unethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo without informing the patient. This practice violates the principle of informed consent, which is a cornerstone of medical ethics. Patients have the right to know what they are being given and to make informed decisions about their treatment. However, there are some rare cases where the use of placebos might be justified, such as in clinical trials where patients are aware that they might receive a placebo. Confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Counterargument Generation)": "Generate 3 potential flaws or counterarguments to your previous reasoning:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Counterargument Generation)": "1. The placebo effect can be beneficial: Some argue that if a placebo can provide real relief to a patient without side effects, it might be in the patient's best interest to receive it, even without full disclosure.\n2. Pragmatic concerns in medical practice: In some cases, doctors might use placebos as a last resort for patients with conditions that have no known effective treatments, prioritizing potential benefit over full disclosure.\n3. Cultural differences in medical ethics: Some cultures may have different views on patient autonomy and the necessity of full disclosure, potentially justifying the use of placebos without explicit consent in certain contexts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Defense and Reassessment)": "Defend against the following counterargument and provide an updated confidence score (0-100): The placebo effect can be beneficial: Some argue that if a placebo can provide real relief to a patient without side effects, it might be in the patient's best interest to receive it, even without full disclosure.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Step 3: Defense and Reassessment)": "Defense: While it's true that the placebo effect can provide real benefits to patients, this argument overlooks the fundamental importance of patient autonomy and trust in the doctor-patient relationship. The potential short-term benefit of a placebo must be weighed against the long-term consequences of deceiving patients. If patients discover they've been given placebos without their knowledge, it could erode trust in medical professionals and the healthcare system as a whole. Additionally, there may be psychological harm caused by the deception itself. Furthermore, by informing patients about placebos, doctors can still harness the placebo effect while maintaining ethical standards. Open-label placebo studies have shown that placebos can still be effective even when patients know they are receiving them. This approach preserves both the potential benefits of placebos and the ethical principle of informed consent. Updated confidence score: 80",
            "explanation": "The ACP method encourages the model to consider counterarguments and potential flaws in its reasoning, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the ethical dilemma. This process results in a slightly lower but potentially more accurate confidence score, reflecting the complexity of the issue and the valid points raised by the counterarguments."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ACP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterarguments and defenses to gain insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases. This could lead to a paper on the limitations of current LLMs in adversarial reasoning tasks. 2) Experiment with variations of the ACP method, such as changing the number of iterations, using different prompting strategies for counterargument generation, or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide the probing process. 3) Investigate whether the ACP method, while not improving overall calibration, might be particularly effective for certain types of questions or domains. This could lead to a targeted application of the method in specific areas where it shows promise. 4) Explore combining ACP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or Bayesian neural networks, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods."
