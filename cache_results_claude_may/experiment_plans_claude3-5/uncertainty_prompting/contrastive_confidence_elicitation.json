        "Problem": "Current methods for eliciting confidence from language models often rely on direct questioning, which can be prone to overconfidence and doesn't capture nuanced uncertainties.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically involve asking the model to rate its confidence directly or using softmax probabilities as a proxy for confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By presenting the model with contrastive options, we can potentially reveal subtle differences in confidence that might not be apparent from direct questioning alone.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Elicitation (CCE), a multi-stage prompting technique: 1) Generate an initial response to the query. 2) Create a set of contrastive alternatives by slightly modifying the original response (e.g., changing key details, introducing plausible errors). 3) Present the model with pairs of options (original vs. alternative) and ask it to compare them, providing reasoning for its preference. 4) Analyze the model's comparisons to derive a fine-grained confidence score. The strength and consistency of the model's preferences across multiple comparisons serve as indicators of its true confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test CCE on a range of tasks including open-ended question answering and factual claim verification. Compare its performance against direct confidence elicitation and other baseline methods using metrics such as Brier score and AUROC for detecting correct vs. incorrect answers."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Elicitation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for eliciting confidence from language models often rely on direct questioning, which can be prone to overconfidence and doesn't capture nuanced uncertainties. This project aims to develop a more robust method for quantifying uncertainty and calibrating confidence in large language models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically involve asking the model to rate its confidence directly or using softmax probabilities as a proxy for confidence. These methods often fail to capture subtle differences in confidence levels and can lead to overconfident predictions. By presenting the model with contrastive options, we can potentially reveal subtle differences in confidence that might not be apparent from direct questioning alone. This approach is inspired by human decision-making processes, where comparing alternatives often leads to more nuanced assessments of certainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Elicitation (CCE), a multi-stage prompting technique: 1) Generate an initial response to the query. 2) Create a set of contrastive alternatives by slightly modifying the original response (e.g., changing key details, introducing plausible errors). 3) Present the model with pairs of options (original vs. alternative) and ask it to compare them, providing reasoning for its preference. 4) Analyze the model's comparisons to derive a fine-grained confidence score. The strength and consistency of the model's preferences across multiple comparisons serve as indicators of its true confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, and 2) FEVER for factual claim verification. These datasets provide a mix of questions and claims with varying levels of difficulty and ambiguity, allowing us to test the effectiveness of CCE across different scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Ask the model to rate its confidence on a scale of 1-10 after generating a response. 2) Softmax probability: Use the maximum softmax probability as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: CCE Implementation": "Implement the CCE method as follows: a) Generate initial response. b) Create 3-5 contrastive alternatives for each response. c) Present pairs of options (original vs. alternative) to the model. d) Collect the model's comparisons and reasoning. e) Derive a confidence score based on the consistency and strength of preferences.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each stage of CCE. For example: Initial response: 'Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]' Contrastive comparison: 'Compare the following two answers to the question \"[QUESTION]\". Which one do you think is more likely to be correct, and why? Answer A: [ORIGINAL_ANSWER] Answer B: [ALTERNATIVE_ANSWER]'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset: a) Generate responses and confidence scores using baseline methods. b) Generate responses and derive confidence scores using CCE. c) Collect model outputs, including initial responses, contrastive comparisons, and final confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CCE compared to baselines using the following metrics: 1) Brier score: Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 2) AUROC: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for detecting correct vs. incorrect answers. 3) ECE: Expected Calibration Error to measure the calibration of confidence scores.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of CCE vs. baseline methods across different question types and difficulty levels. 2) Analysis of the model's reasoning in contrastive comparisons. 3) Investigation of cases where CCE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Rate your confidence in your answer on a scale of 1-10.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 10/10.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for a confidence rating, which may be prone to overconfidence."
            },
            "CCE Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 1 Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
                "Step 2 Input": "Compare the following two answers to the question \"What is the capital of France?\". Which one do you think is more likely to be correct, and why? Answer A: The capital of France is Paris. Answer B: The capital of France is Lyon.",
                "Step 2 Output": "Answer A is more likely to be correct. Paris is widely known and recognized as the capital of France. It is the seat of the French government and has been the capital for centuries. Lyon, while a significant city in France, is not the capital. The certainty of Paris being the capital of France is very high, as this is a well-established fact.",
                "Step 3 Input": "Compare the following two answers to the question \"What is the capital of France?\". Which one do you think is more likely to be correct, and why? Answer A: The capital of France is Paris. Answer B: The capital of France is Marseille.",
                "Step 3 Output": "Answer A is more likely to be correct. Paris is the capital of France, and this is a well-known fact. Marseille, while being an important city and the second-largest in France, is not the capital. The French government, presidential palace, and many national institutions are located in Paris, confirming its status as the capital. There is no doubt that Paris is the correct answer in this comparison.",
                "Explanation": "CCE generates multiple comparisons, allowing for a more nuanced assessment of the model's confidence. The consistency and strength of the model's preference for the correct answer (Paris) across multiple comparisons indicate high confidence."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCE does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining cases where CCE performs poorly, analyzing the generated contrastive alternatives to ensure they are sufficiently challenging, and investigating whether the model's reasoning in comparisons aligns with human judgment. We could also explore variations of CCE, such as increasing the number of contrastive alternatives or experimenting with different prompting strategies for the comparison stage. Additionally, we might consider turning the project into an analysis paper, focusing on how different types of contrastive alternatives affect the model's confidence assessment and what this reveals about the model's understanding and reasoning capabilities. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of large language models in assessing their own knowledge and uncertainty."
