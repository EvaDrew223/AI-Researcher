        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simplistic confidence scores or fail to capture the nuanced spectrum of model uncertainty across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use single-point estimates of confidence or rely on computationally expensive ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically generating targeted paraphrases that probe specific aspects of the model's knowledge, we can sample a more comprehensive confidence spectrum and identify areas of high and low certainty within a single response.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting approach: 1) Generate an initial response. 2) Identify key claims or facts within the response. 3) For each key point, generate a set of paraphrases that vary in their specificity, generality, and phrasing. 4) Prompt the model to rate its confidence in each paraphrase variant. 5) Aggregate these targeted confidence scores to create a detailed confidence spectrum for the overall response, highlighting areas of high and low certainty. This method allows for fine-grained uncertainty quantification without requiring model modifications or extensive computational resources.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on factual QA datasets, comparing against baseline confidence scoring methods. Measure the correlation between the generated confidence spectrum and human judgments of answer correctness and completeness. Analyze the method's ability to identify specific areas of uncertainty within complex, multi-part responses."

        "Title": "Spectrum Sampling: A Multi-Step Prompting Approach for Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic confidence scores or fail to capture the nuanced spectrum of model uncertainty across different aspects of a response. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess the reliability of LLM outputs, particularly in complex, multi-faceted responses.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use single-point estimates of confidence or rely on computationally expensive ensemble methods. These methods often fail to capture the varying degrees of certainty an LLM may have about different aspects of its response. By systematically generating targeted paraphrases that probe specific aspects of the model's knowledge, we can sample a more comprehensive confidence spectrum and identify areas of high and low certainty within a single response. This approach leverages the LLM's own capabilities to generate and evaluate variations of its responses, providing a more nuanced and informative measure of uncertainty without requiring model modifications or extensive computational resources.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Spectrum Sampling, a multi-step prompting approach for fine-grained uncertainty quantification: 1) Generate an initial response to the input query. 2) Identify key claims or facts within the response. 3) For each key point, generate a set of paraphrases that vary in their specificity, generality, and phrasing. 4) Prompt the model to rate its confidence in each paraphrase variant. 5) Aggregate these targeted confidence scores to create a detailed confidence spectrum for the overall response, highlighting areas of high and low certainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset, which contains questions designed to elicit true or false responses from language models. This dataset is particularly suitable as it covers a wide range of topics and includes questions with varying degrees of difficulty and specificity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence scoring: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for its answer. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs to generate an ensemble-based uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 3: Spectrum Sampling Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following sub-steps for each question in the dataset: a) Generate initial response: Prompt the model with 'Answer the following question: [QUESTION]'. b) Identify key claims: Prompt with 'Identify the key claims or facts in this answer: [INITIAL_RESPONSE]'. c) Generate paraphrases: For each key claim, prompt with 'Generate 5 paraphrases of this claim, varying in specificity and generality: [CLAIM]'. d) Confidence rating: For each paraphrase, prompt with 'Rate your confidence in this statement from 0 to 100: [PARAPHRASE]'. e) Aggregate confidence scores: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation of confidence scores for each key claim and for the overall response.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of Spectrum Sampling against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Correlation with human judgments of answer correctness (we will use the ground truth labels provided in TruthfulQA). 2) Ability to identify specific areas of uncertainty within complex, multi-part responses (measured by comparing model-identified low-confidence claims with human-identified inaccuracies). 3) Calibration of confidence scores (using calibration plots and expected calibration error).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of confidence spectrums across different question types and difficulty levels. 2) Analysis of how paraphrase variation affects confidence scores. 3) Investigation of cases where Spectrum Sampling significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "Q: What material are Roman roads primarily made of? Please provide your answer and then rate your confidence in your answer on a scale from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "A: Roman roads were primarily made of layers of stone and gravel, often topped with large, flat paving stones. The main layers typically included a foundation of rough stones, a layer of smaller stones mixed with lime mortar, a layer of gravel and cement, and finally the surface layer of flat paving stones.\n\nConfidence: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Spectrum Sampling; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What material are Roman roads primarily made of?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Spectrum Sampling; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Roman roads were primarily made of layers of stone and gravel, often topped with large, flat paving stones. The main layers typically included a foundation of rough stones, a layer of smaller stones mixed with lime mortar, a layer of gravel and cement, and finally the surface layer of flat paving stones.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Spectrum Sampling; Step 2: Identify Key Claims)": "Identify the key claims or facts in this answer: [INITIAL_RESPONSE]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Spectrum Sampling; Step 2: Identify Key Claims)": "1. Roman roads were made of layers of stone and gravel.\n2. The top layer often consisted of large, flat paving stones.\n3. The road structure included multiple layers: foundation of rough stones, smaller stones mixed with lime mortar, gravel and cement, and surface paving stones.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Spectrum Sampling; Step 3: Generate Paraphrases)": "Generate 5 paraphrases of this claim, varying in specificity and generality: Roman roads were made of layers of stone and gravel.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Spectrum Sampling; Step 3: Generate Paraphrases)": "1. Ancient Roman thoroughfares consisted of multiple strata of rock and crushed stone.\n2. The Romans constructed their roads using various sizes of stone material.\n3. Layered lithic materials formed the basis of Roman road construction.\n4. Roman engineering involved the strategic placement of stone and gravel in road building.\n5. Roads in the Roman Empire were typically composed of stratified rock-based materials.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Spectrum Sampling; Step 4: Confidence Rating)": "Rate your confidence in this statement from 0 to 100: Ancient Roman thoroughfares consisted of multiple strata of rock and crushed stone.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Spectrum Sampling; Step 4: Confidence Rating)": "Confidence: 95",
            "explanation": "The Spectrum Sampling method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence across different aspects of its response. By generating and evaluating paraphrases, it can identify areas of high and low certainty within a single answer, offering a more comprehensive uncertainty quantification compared to the single-point estimate in the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Spectrum Sampling method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the paraphrase generation process to understand how different types of paraphrases affect confidence scores. This could lead to insights on how LLMs represent and reason about their own knowledge. 2) Investigate the relationship between the granularity of key claims and the resulting confidence spectrum. We could experiment with different levels of claim decomposition to find an optimal balance between detail and overall confidence assessment. 3) Explore how Spectrum Sampling performs across different types of questions or domains, which could reveal interesting patterns about LLM knowledge representation and uncertainty. 4) Compare the confidence spectrums generated by different LLM models (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4) to analyze how model size and training affect uncertainty quantification. These alternative directions could still yield valuable insights into LLM behavior and uncertainty, even if the original hypothesis about improved uncertainty quantification is not fully supported."
