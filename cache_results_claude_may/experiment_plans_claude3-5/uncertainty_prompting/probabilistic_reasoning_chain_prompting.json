        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks that require multiple steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like Chain-of-Thought prompting focus on improving reasoning but don't explicitly address uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing complex reasoning into a series of probabilistic steps, we can better capture uncertainties that accumulate through the reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Reasoning Chain (PRC) prompting, where the model is asked to break down its reasoning into a series of steps, each accompanied by a probability estimate. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Decompose the problem into sub-questions, 2) Answer each sub-question with a confidence level, 3) Propagate uncertainties through the chain using basic probability theory, and 4) Provide a final answer with an overall confidence score. For example, a prompt might include: 'Break down the problem into smaller steps. For each step, provide your answer and your confidence (0-100%). Then, combine these to give a final answer and overall confidence.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare PRC prompting against standard prompting and Chain-of-Thought prompting on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and GSM8K. Evaluate using both task performance metrics and calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error."

        "Title": "Probabilistic Reasoning Chain: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks that require multiple steps. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks involving mathematical reasoning, scientific problem-solving, or multi-step logical deductions.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like Chain-of-Thought prompting have shown success in improving reasoning capabilities but don't explicitly address uncertainty quantification. By decomposing complex reasoning into a series of probabilistic steps, we can better capture uncertainties that accumulate through the reasoning process. This approach is inspired by how humans often break down complex problems and assign confidence levels to each step of their reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Reasoning Chain (PRC) prompting, a novel method that guides LLMs to break down their reasoning into a series of steps, each accompanied by a probability estimate. The process involves four key steps: 1) Decompose the problem into sub-questions, 2) Answer each sub-question with a confidence level, 3) Propagate uncertainties through the chain using basic probability theory, and 4) Provide a final answer with an overall confidence score. The prompt instructs the model to follow this structure, encouraging a more nuanced and quantifiable approach to uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and GSM8K. Select a subset of 1000 problems from each dataset, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementations": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Chain-of-Thought prompting, and 3) Few-shot prompting with 3-5 examples.",
            "Step 3: PRC Prompt Design": "Design the PRC prompt template. Example: 'Break down the problem into smaller steps. For each step, provide your answer and your confidence (0-100%). Then, combine these to give a final answer and overall confidence.' Include 2-3 examples in the prompt to demonstrate the desired format.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Generate Responses": "For each problem in the datasets, generate responses using all methods (baselines and PRC). Store full responses, including intermediate steps and confidence scores for PRC.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement evaluation scripts for: 1) Task performance (accuracy), 2) Calibration metrics (Expected Calibration Error, Brier Score), and 3) Uncertainty quality (e.g., entropy of confidence distribution).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare PRC against baselines on all metrics. Analyze how uncertainty propagates through reasoning chains and its impact on final predictions.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablations by varying the number of reasoning steps, removing the confidence scoring, or altering the probability combination method.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Manually review a sample of responses to identify patterns in where PRC succeeds or fails compared to baselines.",
            "Step 10: Reporting": "Compile results into tables and graphs. Prepare a detailed report or paper draft summarizing the findings, methodology, and implications."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then increases its speed to 90 km/h for the next 1 hour. What is the total distance traveled?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The total distance traveled is 210 km.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then increases its speed to 90 km/h for the next 1 hour. What is the total distance traveled? Let's approach this step by step.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Let's break this down step by step:\n1. For the first 2 hours:\n   - Speed = 60 km/h\n   - Time = 2 hours\n   - Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 60 \u00d7 2 = 120 km\n\n2. For the next 1 hour:\n   - Speed = 90 km/h\n   - Time = 1 hour\n   - Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 90 \u00d7 1 = 90 km\n\n3. Total distance:\n   - Total = Distance in first 2 hours + Distance in next 1 hour\n   - Total = 120 km + 90 km = 210 km\n\nTherefore, the total distance traveled by the train is 210 km.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PRC Prompting)": "A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then increases its speed to 90 km/h for the next 1 hour. What is the total distance traveled? Break down the problem into smaller steps. For each step, provide your answer and your confidence (0-100%). Then, combine these to give a final answer and overall confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PRC Prompting)": "1. Calculate distance for first 2 hours:\n   - Distance = 60 km/h \u00d7 2 hours = 120 km\n   - Confidence: 95% (simple multiplication)\n\n2. Calculate distance for next 1 hour:\n   - Distance = 90 km/h \u00d7 1 hour = 90 km\n   - Confidence: 95% (simple multiplication)\n\n3. Sum up total distance:\n   - Total distance = 120 km + 90 km = 210 km\n   - Confidence: 90% (addition of two confident calculations, slight decrease due to potential rounding errors)\n\nFinal answer: The total distance traveled is 210 km.\nOverall confidence: 90% (The overall confidence is limited by the lowest confidence in the chain, which is the final addition step)",
            "explanation": "The PRC method provides a structured approach to breaking down the problem, assigning confidence levels to each step, and propagating uncertainty. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the model's certainty in its reasoning process, which is not captured by the baseline methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the PRC method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification or task performance, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze why PRC fails, examining whether the issue lies in the decomposition of problems, the assignment of probabilities, or the combination of uncertainties. This could lead to insights about how LLMs reason about uncertainty. Second, we could explore variations of PRC, such as incorporating external knowledge sources for probability estimation or using different probability combination methods. Third, we could turn this into a comparative study of different uncertainty quantification methods in LLMs, broadening our scope to include other techniques like ensemble methods or temperature scaling. Finally, we could focus on analyzing the patterns in confidence assignments across different types of reasoning tasks, potentially uncovering insights about the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in different domains of reasoning."
