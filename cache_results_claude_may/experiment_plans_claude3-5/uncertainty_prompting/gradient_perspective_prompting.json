    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide binary or poorly calibrated confidence estimates, failing to capture nuanced degrees of certainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches use direct confidence elicitation or simple scaling of output probabilities.",
        "Motivation": "By encouraging the model to think in terms of gradients of certainty, we can obtain more fine-grained and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient Perspective Prompting (GPP), a technique that guides the LLM to consider a spectrum of certainty. For a given query, we use a series of prompts that gradually increase the required confidence threshold. For example: '1) What's your best guess for X, even if you're not very sure? 2) What would you say X is if you needed to be at least 50% confident? 3) What about if you needed to be at least 90% confident? 4) Is there any answer you'd be 99% or more confident in?' We then analyze the pattern of responses across this gradient to derive a nuanced uncertainty estimate. This approach allows us to map out the model's confidence landscape more comprehensively.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate GPP on a range of question-answering and fact-checking tasks, comparing it to direct confidence elicitation and other uncertainty quantification methods. We'll assess both the informativeness of the gradient responses and the calibration of the final uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Gradient Perspective Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide binary or poorly calibrated confidence estimates, failing to capture nuanced degrees of certainty. This limitation hinders their reliability and interpretability in real-world applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as direct confidence elicitation or simple scaling of output probabilities, often fail to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty. By encouraging the model to think in terms of gradients of certainty, we can obtain more fine-grained and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This approach aligns with human cognitive processes, where we often consider varying levels of confidence before making a final judgment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient Perspective Prompting (GPP), a technique that guides the LLM to consider a spectrum of certainty. For a given query, we use a series of prompts that gradually increase the required confidence threshold. The process involves four main steps: 1) Ask for the model's best guess, even with low confidence. 2) Request an answer with at least 50% confidence. 3) Seek an answer with at least 90% confidence. 4) Ask if there's any answer the model would be 99% or more confident in. We then analyze the pattern of responses across this gradient to derive a nuanced uncertainty estimate. This approach allows us to map out the model's confidence landscape more comprehensively, potentially revealing insights about the model's knowledge and reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of domains and difficulty levels, allowing us to test the robustness of our method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each question. 2) Temperature scaling: Generate multiple samples with different temperature settings and use the variance as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: GPP Implementation": "Implement the Gradient Perspective Prompting method. For each question in the datasets, create a series of prompts following the four-step process described in the Proposed Method section. Ensure that the prompts are consistent across all questions and datasets.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and GPP), collect model responses and confidence estimates. For GPP, record the model's answers at each confidence threshold.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence estimates with its actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Assess the difference between confidence and accuracy across bins. 4) Area Under the Confidence-Accuracy Curve: Evaluate the trade-off between confidence and accuracy.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of GPP against the baselines using the implemented metrics. Analyze how the model's responses change across different confidence thresholds in GPP. Investigate cases where GPP provides significantly different uncertainty estimates compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of GPP: 1) Vary the number of confidence thresholds. 2) Experiment with different phrasings for the confidence prompts. 3) Test the effect of reversing the order of confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Manually inspect a subset of examples where GPP performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines. Categorize the types of questions or domains where GPP shows the most improvement or faces challenges."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GPP)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\n1) What's your best guess, even if you're not very sure?\n2) What would you say if you needed to be at least 50% confident?\n3) What about if you needed to be at least 90% confident?\n4) Is there any answer you'd be 99% or more confident in?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GPP)": "1) My best guess is Paris, even though I'm not very sure.\n2) If I needed to be at least 50% confident, I would still say Paris.\n3) If I needed to be at least 90% confident, I would again say Paris.\n4) Yes, I can say with 99% or more confidence that the capital of France is Paris.",
            "Explanation": "In this example, GPP provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence. While both methods ultimately express high confidence, GPP shows how the model's certainty increases across different thresholds, potentially revealing more about its reasoning process and knowledge state."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If GPP does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from GPP, even if the overall performance is similar. Additionally, we could explore combining GPP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or Bayesian neural networks, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Another direction could be to analyze the patterns in how models change their answers across confidence thresholds, which might provide insights into the model's reasoning process and knowledge representation, even if it doesn't directly improve calibration. Finally, we could expand our study to include human evaluations of the uncertainty estimates, comparing how well GPP aligns with human judgments of confidence compared to baseline methods."
