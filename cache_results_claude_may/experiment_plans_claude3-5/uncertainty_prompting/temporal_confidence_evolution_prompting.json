    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide static confidence estimates that don't account for how uncertainty might change over time or with additional information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on point-in-time confidence estimation without considering temporal dynamics.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence in knowledge often evolves over time as we acquire new information or forget details. Modeling this temporal aspect could lead to more realistic and dynamic uncertainty quantification in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Confidence Evolution Prompting, a technique that simulates the passage of time and information acquisition to dynamically update confidence estimates. The process involves: 1) Initial Confidence: Prompt the LLM for an initial confidence estimate on a given query. 2) Time Simulation: Use prompts to simulate the passage of time (e.g., 'One day later...', 'One week later...'). 3) Information Update: At each time step, prompt the model to generate potential new information or memory decay. 4) Confidence Re-estimation: Prompt the LLM to update its confidence based on the simulated temporal changes and information updates. 5) Confidence Trajectory: Analyze the evolution of confidence over the simulated time period to provide a more comprehensive uncertainty assessment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on knowledge-based tasks with temporal aspects, such as current events or rapidly evolving fields. Compare against static confidence estimation methods, measuring the realism and accuracy of the confidence trajectories using specially designed temporal calibration metrics."

        "Title": "Temporal Confidence Evolution Prompting: Dynamic Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide static confidence estimates that don't account for how uncertainty might change over time or with additional information. This limitation fails to capture the dynamic nature of human confidence, which evolves as we acquire new information or forget details.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically focus on point-in-time assessments without considering temporal dynamics. Human confidence in knowledge often evolves over time, and modeling this temporal aspect could lead to more realistic and dynamic uncertainty quantification in LLMs. By introducing a method that simulates the passage of time and information acquisition, we can potentially achieve more nuanced and context-aware confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Confidence Evolution Prompting (TCEP), a technique that simulates the passage of time and information acquisition to dynamically update confidence estimates. The process involves five key steps: 1) Initial Confidence: Prompt the LLM for an initial confidence estimate on a given query. 2) Time Simulation: Use prompts to simulate the passage of time (e.g., 'One day later...', 'One week later...'). 3) Information Update: At each time step, prompt the model to generate potential new information or memory decay. 4) Confidence Re-estimation: Prompt the LLM to update its confidence based on the simulated temporal changes and information updates. 5) Confidence Trajectory: Analyze the evolution of confidence over the simulated time period to provide a more comprehensive uncertainty assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of knowledge-based questions with temporal aspects. Use a mix of current events, historical facts, and rapidly evolving fields (e.g., technology, science). Collect 100-200 questions, each with a correct answer and relevant temporal information.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Static Confidence Estimation: Prompt the LLM to provide a single confidence score for each question. 2) Multi-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Confidence: Use CoT prompting to break down the reasoning process and estimate confidence at each step.",
            "Step 3: TCEP Implementation": "Implement the Temporal Confidence Evolution Prompting method: a) Initial Confidence: Prompt for initial answer and confidence. b) Time Simulation: Create prompts for different time intervals (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month). c) Information Update: Generate potential new information or forgetting effects. d) Confidence Re-estimation: Update confidence based on simulated changes. e) Confidence Trajectory: Track confidence changes over time.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of final answers. 2) Calibration Error: Compare estimated confidence with actual accuracy. 3) Temporal Consistency: Assess how well confidence changes align with simulated information updates. 4) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Run both baseline methods. b) Run TCEP with 3 time steps (1 day, 1 week, 1 month). c) Record all intermediate outputs, confidence scores, and final answers.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare TCEP against baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze confidence trajectories to identify patterns in how uncertainty evolves over time for different types of questions.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying: a) Number of time steps. b) Prompt formulations for information updates. c) Confidence re-estimation strategies."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Static Confidence)": "Q: Who is the current CEO of OpenAI? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Static Confidence)": "A: The current CEO of OpenAI is Sam Altman. Confidence: 95",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Multi-step CoT Confidence)": "Q: Who is the current CEO of OpenAI? Please break down your reasoning process and provide a confidence level (0-100) for each step and a final confidence.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Multi-step CoT Confidence)": "1. Recall recent news about OpenAI (Confidence: 90)\n2. Remember Sam Altman's role (Confidence: 95)\n3. Check if there have been any recent changes (Confidence: 85)\nFinal Answer: The current CEO of OpenAI is Sam Altman. Final Confidence: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCEP; Step 1: Initial Confidence)": "Q: Who is the current CEO of OpenAI? Provide your answer and initial confidence level (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCEP; Step 1: Initial Confidence)": "A: The current CEO of OpenAI is Sam Altman. Initial Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCEP; Step 2: Time Simulation)": "It's now one month later. What new information might have emerged about OpenAI's CEO in this time?",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (TCEP; Step 2: Time Simulation)": "In the past month, there might have been: 1) News articles about Sam Altman's leadership 2) Announcements of new OpenAI projects 3) Interviews or public appearances by Sam Altman 4) Potential rumors or speculation about leadership changes",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCEP; Step 3: Confidence Re-estimation)": "Given this potential new information, re-evaluate your confidence in Sam Altman being the current CEO of OpenAI. Provide your updated confidence level (0-100) and explain why it changed or remained the same.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCEP; Step 3: Confidence Re-estimation)": "Updated Confidence: 98\nExplanation: The potential new information, such as recent news articles, project announcements, and public appearances, likely reinforces Sam Altman's position as CEO. The absence of any concrete news about leadership changes increases confidence slightly from the initial estimate.",
            "explanation": "TCEP allows for dynamic updating of confidence based on simulated passage of time and potential new information, providing a more nuanced assessment compared to static or step-wise confidence estimation methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCEP doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the patterns of confidence evolution across different question types to gain insights into how LLMs reason about uncertainty over time. This could lead to an interesting analysis paper on temporal aspects of LLM confidence. 2) Investigate why certain questions show more dynamic confidence trajectories than others, potentially uncovering biases or limitations in the LLM's knowledge representation. 3) Explore how different prompt formulations for time simulation and information updates affect the confidence trajectories, which could inform better prompt engineering practices for temporal reasoning tasks. 4) Combine TCEP with other prompting techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-consistency) to see if hybrid approaches yield better results. 5) If the simulated time passage doesn't significantly impact confidence, we could pivot to studying how real-world information changes (e.g., using news feeds) affect LLM confidence over time, turning this into a study on LLM adaptability to new information."
