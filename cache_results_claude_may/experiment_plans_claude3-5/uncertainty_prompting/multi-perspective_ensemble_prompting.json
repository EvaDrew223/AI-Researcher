        "Problem": "Single-perspective confidence estimation in LLMs can be biased or incomplete, failing to capture the full range of potential uncertainties.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on a single prompt or perspective for confidence estimation, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating multiple perspectives or expertise levels within the LLM, we can obtain a more comprehensive view of potential uncertainties and achieve better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting (MPEP), a technique that leverages the LLM's ability to adopt different personas or expertise levels to create an ensemble of confidence estimates. MPEP consists of: (1) Perspective Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a diverse set of relevant perspectives or expertise levels for the given task. (2) Multi-Perspective Confidence Elicitation: For each generated perspective, prompt the LLM to adopt that viewpoint and provide a confidence estimate along with supporting reasoning. (3) Ensemble Aggregation: Combine the multiple confidence estimates using various aggregation methods (e.g., weighted averaging, uncertainty-based weighting).

        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Single-perspective confidence estimation in Large Language Models (LLMs) can be biased or incomplete, failing to capture the full range of potential uncertainties. This limitation can lead to overconfident or poorly calibrated predictions, potentially resulting in unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically rely on a single prompt or perspective for confidence estimation, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty. By simulating multiple perspectives or expertise levels within the LLM, we can obtain a more comprehensive view of potential uncertainties and achieve better-calibrated confidence estimates. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to adopt different personas and reasoning styles, potentially leading to more robust and nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting (MPEP), a technique that leverages the LLM's ability to adopt different personas or expertise levels to create an ensemble of confidence estimates. MPEP consists of four main steps: (1) Perspective Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a diverse set of relevant perspectives or expertise levels for the given task. (2) Multi-Perspective Confidence Elicitation: For each generated perspective, prompt the LLM to adopt that viewpoint and provide a confidence estimate along with supporting reasoning. (3) Ensemble Aggregation: Combine the multiple confidence estimates using various aggregation methods (e.g., weighted averaging, uncertainty-based weighting). (4) Meta-Analysis: Prompt the LLM to analyze the ensemble of estimates, identifying key sources of agreement or disagreement to provide a final, nuanced confidence assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover a range of tasks and potential for expert disagreement: (1) TruthfulQA for assessing model honesty, (2) MMLU for evaluating multi-task knowledge, and (3) AmbigQA for handling ambiguous questions. These datasets provide a diverse set of challenges for uncertainty quantification.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score (0-100%) along with its answer. (2) Calibrated confidence estimation: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the LLM's output probabilities.",
            "Step 3: MPEP Implementation": "Implement the four steps of MPEP: (1) Perspective Generation: Prompt the LLM with 'Generate 5 diverse and relevant expert perspectives for answering questions about [topic].' (2) Multi-Perspective Confidence Elicitation: For each perspective, prompt with 'As a [perspective], answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100%) with reasoning: [question]' (3) Ensemble Aggregation: Implement weighted averaging and uncertainty-based weighting methods. (4) Meta-Analysis: Prompt the LLM with 'Analyze the following confidence estimates and reasoning from different perspectives. Provide a final confidence assessment and explain any agreements or disagreements: [list of perspective-based estimates]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of MPEP compared to baselines: (1) Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. (2) Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (3) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores. (4) Spearman correlation: Measure the correlation between predicted confidence and human expert confidence ratings (for a subset of questions).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (1) Run the baseline methods and collect results. (2) Run MPEP and collect results for each step of the process. (3) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and MPEP.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: (1) Compare MPEP performance against baselines across all metrics and datasets. (2) Analyze the diversity and relevance of generated perspectives. (3) Examine how different aggregation methods affect the final confidence estimates. (4) Investigate cases where MPEP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. (5) Assess the quality and insights provided by the meta-analysis step."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score (0-100%) for your response.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPEP Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "Generate 5 diverse and relevant expert perspectives for answering questions about world geography and capitals.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPEP Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "1. Geographer\n2. History Professor\n3. Travel Guide Writer\n4. Diplomat\n5. Cartographer",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPEP Step 2: Multi-Perspective Confidence Elicitation)": "As a Geographer, answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100%) with reasoning: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPEP Step 2: Multi-Perspective Confidence Elicitation)": "A: As a Geographer, I can confidently state that the capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100%. Reasoning: Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, serving as the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. It's a well-established fact in geography and is not subject to any recent changes or disputes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPEP Step 3: Ensemble Aggregation)": "Aggregate the following confidence scores using weighted averaging: [100%, 100%, 99%, 100%, 100%]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPEP Step 3: Ensemble Aggregation)": "Aggregated confidence score: 99.8%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPEP Step 4: Meta-Analysis)": "Analyze the following confidence estimates and reasoning from different perspectives. Provide a final confidence assessment and explain any agreements or disagreements: [List of perspective-based estimates from Step 2]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPEP Step 4: Meta-Analysis)": "Final confidence assessment: 99.8%. There is strong agreement across all perspectives that Paris is the capital of France. The slight variation in confidence (99% from one perspective) might be due to a cautious approach or consideration of historical changes in capitals. Overall, the high confidence and consistency across perspectives indicate that this is a well-established fact with minimal uncertainty.",
            "Explanation": "MPEP provides a more nuanced and comprehensive confidence assessment by considering multiple perspectives and analyzing potential sources of uncertainty. This approach can capture subtle variations in confidence that might be missed by single-perspective methods, leading to more reliable uncertainty quantification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MPEP does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can explore several alternative directions: (1) Analyze the generated perspectives to understand if they are sufficiently diverse and relevant. If not, we can experiment with different prompting strategies to improve perspective generation. (2) Investigate the individual performance of each perspective to identify if certain viewpoints consistently provide more accurate or better-calibrated estimates. This could lead to a study on optimal perspective selection for different types of questions. (3) Explore more sophisticated aggregation methods, such as Bayesian model averaging or ensemble distillation, to better combine the multi-perspective estimates. (4) Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify patterns in questions or topics where MPEP underperforms. This could reveal limitations in the approach and suggest targeted improvements. (5) Expand the study to include a wider range of tasks and datasets to better understand the generalizability of the method. (6) If the meta-analysis step is not providing significant value, we could focus on developing more advanced techniques for synthesizing the multi-perspective estimates, potentially using a separate fine-tuned model for this purpose."
