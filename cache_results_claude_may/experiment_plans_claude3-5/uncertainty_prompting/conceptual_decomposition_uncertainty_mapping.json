        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to provide granular and interpretable uncertainty estimates, especially for complex queries that involve multiple concepts or reasoning steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically provide overall confidence scores or rely on token-level probabilities, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties associated with different conceptual components of a response.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by techniques in concept mapping and knowledge representation, we propose a method to decompose complex queries into their constituent concepts and map uncertainties at this granular level.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Conceptual Decomposition Uncertainty Mapping (CDUM), a structured prompting approach that breaks down uncertainty estimation into several steps: 1) Concept Extraction: Prompt the model to identify and list the key concepts or knowledge domains required to answer the query comprehensively. 2) Concept Hierarchy Construction: Guide the model to organize these concepts into a hierarchical structure, showing how they relate to and depend on each other in the context of the query. 3) Granular Uncertainty Estimation: For each concept in the hierarchy, prompt the model to provide a specific uncertainty estimate, considering factors such as its confidence in understanding the concept, its relevance to the query, and the reliability of its knowledge about the concept. 4) Uncertainty Propagation: Instruct the model to analyze how uncertainties at lower levels of the concept hierarchy propagate and influence uncertainties at higher levels. 5) Holistic Uncertainty Synthesis: Finally, prompt the model to synthesize these granular uncertainty estimates into an overall uncertainty map, highlighting areas of high confidence and critical uncertainties that significantly impact the final response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CDUM with traditional uncertainty estimation methods on a diverse set of complex queries spanning multiple domains (e.g., interdisciplinary scientific questions, multi-step logical reasoning problems). Evaluate the method's ability to provide more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates, particularly in identifying specific areas where the model's knowledge or reasoning is weak. Conduct user studies to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the generated uncertainty maps for human decision-makers."

            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Quantum computing has the potential to break many current encryption methods, particularly those based on factoring large numbers or discrete logarithms, such as RSA and ECC. This is due to Shor's algorithm, which can efficiently solve these problems on a sufficiently large quantum computer. As a result, many widely used encryption methods could become vulnerable, potentially compromising secure communications and data storage. However, quantum-resistant encryption methods, also known as post-quantum cryptography, are being developed to mitigate this threat. These new methods rely on mathematical problems that are believed to be difficult even for quantum computers to solve. The transition to these new encryption methods will be crucial for maintaining cybersecurity in the quantum era. Confidence score: 85%",

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDUM; Step 4: Uncertainty Propagation)": "The high uncertainty in quantum-resistant algorithms (50%) significantly increases the uncertainty in post-quantum cryptography (40%). This, in turn, contributes to the moderate uncertainty in cryptography principles (15%) when considered in the context of future developments. The uncertainty in Shor's algorithm (35%) combines with the uncertainty in quantum computing (30%) to create significant uncertainty about the precise timeline and extent of quantum computing's impact on current encryption methods. The relatively lower uncertainty in current encryption methods (20%) and factoring/discrete logarithm problems (25%) provides a stable base for understanding the potential vulnerabilities, but the higher uncertainties in quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography make it challenging to predict the exact nature and timing of the impact with high confidence.",

We have high confidence in explaining the potential vulnerability of current encryption methods to quantum computing. However, there is significant uncertainty in predicting the exact timeline of when quantum computers will be powerful enough to break these encryptions and in determining which post-quantum cryptographic methods will prove most effective. The interplay between the rapidly evolving fields of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography introduces compounding uncertainties that make precise predictions challenging.",
            "explanation": "The CDUM method provides a more detailed and nuanced uncertainty assessment compared to the baseline method. It breaks down the query into constituent concepts, estimates uncertainties for each, and shows how these uncertainties propagate and combine. This approach offers more actionable insights, highlighting specific areas (like quantum-resistant algorithms) where knowledge is most uncertain and potentially guiding further research or inquiry."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CDUM method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why CDUM fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in metacognition and self-assessment. 2) Explore variations of the CDUM method, such as iterative refinement of the concept hierarchy or uncertainty estimates, or incorporating external knowledge sources to improve concept extraction. 3) Investigate how different prompting strategies within each step of CDUM affect the final uncertainty estimates. 4) Analyze the relationship between the granularity of concept decomposition and the quality of uncertainty estimates, which could lead to insights about the optimal level of abstraction for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. 5) Explore how CDUM performs across different types of queries or domains, which could reveal interesting patterns about where structured decomposition is most beneficial for uncertainty estimation."
