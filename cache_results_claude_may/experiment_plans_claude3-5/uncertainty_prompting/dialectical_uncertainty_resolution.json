        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to consider multiple perspectives when assessing their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident and biased estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or limited self-questioning.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a dialectical process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, we can encourage more thorough exploration of potential uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dialectical Uncertainty Resolution (DUR), a multi-step prompting process: 1) Initial response and confidence estimate (thesis). 2) Prompt for counterarguments and alternative viewpoints (antithesis), e.g., 'What are the strongest arguments against your initial response?' 3) Reconciliation and revised confidence estimate (synthesis), e.g., 'Considering these counterarguments, revise your initial response and confidence if needed.' 4) Repeat steps 2-3 for multiple iterations, with prompts encouraging exploration of different aspects each time. 5) Aggregate the confidence estimates from each iteration, weighing later iterations more heavily.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate DUR against single-pass confidence estimation and other multi-step methods on tasks requiring nuanced understanding, such as ethical dilemmas, scientific hypotheses, and complex reasoning problems. Measure improvements in calibration and the quality of uncertainty justifications."

        "Title": "Dialectical Uncertainty Resolution: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately assess their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident and biased estimates. This problem is particularly pronounced when dealing with complex tasks that require nuanced understanding and consideration of multiple perspectives.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or limited self-questioning, which may not capture the full range of potential uncertainties. By simulating a dialectical process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, we can encourage more thorough exploration of potential uncertainties and improve the calibration of confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human reasoning processes, where considering counterarguments and alternative viewpoints often leads to more nuanced and accurate assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dialectical Uncertainty Resolution (DUR), a multi-step prompting process: 1) Initial response and confidence estimate (thesis). 2) Prompt for counterarguments and alternative viewpoints (antithesis). 3) Reconciliation and revised confidence estimate (synthesis). 4) Repeat steps 2-3 for multiple iterations, with prompts encouraging exploration of different aspects each time. 5) Aggregate the confidence estimates from each iteration, weighing later iterations more heavily.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require nuanced understanding: 1) Ethical dilemmas from the ETHICS dataset, 2) Scientific hypotheses from the ScienceQA dataset, and 3) Complex reasoning problems from the BIG-bench dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Single-pass confidence estimation: directly ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 2) Self-consistency: generate multiple responses and use their agreement as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: Implement DUR": "For each question in the datasets: a) Generate initial response and confidence (thesis). b) Prompt for counterarguments (antithesis): 'What are the strongest arguments against your initial response?' c) Reconcile and revise (synthesis): 'Considering these counterarguments, revise your initial response and confidence if needed.' d) Repeat b-c for 3 iterations, each time prompting to explore different aspects. e) Aggregate confidence estimates, weighing later iterations more heavily.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: assess the quality of probabilistic predictions. 3) Quality of uncertainty justifications: use GPT-4 to rate the comprehensiveness and relevance of the model's explanations for its uncertainty on a scale of 1-10.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run the DUR method. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and DUR.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of DUR against the baselines across all datasets and models. Analyze how the confidence estimates and justifications evolve over the iterations of the dialectical process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-pass)": "Q: A new drug shows promising results in treating a rare disease, but it has severe side effects in 10% of patients. Should it be approved for use? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-pass)": "A: Yes, the drug should be approved for use. For patients with a rare disease, having a promising treatment option can be life-changing or even life-saving. While the severe side effects in 10% of patients are concerning, this risk might be acceptable given the potential benefits for the majority of patients. However, it's crucial that patients and healthcare providers are fully informed about the potential side effects so they can make informed decisions. Confidence score: 75",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUR; Step 1: Thesis)": "Q: A new drug shows promising results in treating a rare disease, but it has severe side effects in 10% of patients. Should it be approved for use? Provide your initial answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUR; Step 1: Thesis)": "A: Yes, the drug should be approved for use. For patients with a rare disease, having a promising treatment option can be life-changing or even life-saving. While the severe side effects in 10% of patients are concerning, this risk might be acceptable given the potential benefits for the majority of patients. However, it's crucial that patients and healthcare providers are fully informed about the potential side effects so they can make informed decisions. Confidence score: 75",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUR; Step 2: Antithesis)": "What are the strongest arguments against your initial response?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUR; Step 2: Antithesis)": "1. Ethical concerns: Approving a drug that causes severe side effects in 10% of patients could be seen as unethical, as it knowingly puts a significant number of people at risk.\n2. Legal liability: The pharmaceutical company and healthcare providers could face lawsuits from patients who experience severe side effects.\n3. Alternative treatments: There might be other treatments in development with fewer side effects that could be prioritized instead.\n4. Long-term effects unknown: The long-term effects of the drug might not be fully understood, potentially leading to more severe consequences in the future.\n5. Resource allocation: Approving this drug might divert resources from developing safer alternatives.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUR; Step 3: Synthesis)": "Considering these counterarguments, revise your initial response and confidence if needed.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUR; Step 3: Synthesis)": "A: After considering the counterarguments, I would revise my answer to be more nuanced. The drug should be approved for use, but with significant caveats and restrictions. It should only be prescribed in cases where the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks, and where patients have been fully informed of and consent to the potential side effects. Additionally, approval should be conditional on continued research into mitigating the side effects and developing safer alternatives. The approval should also require a robust monitoring system to track long-term effects and allow for quick action if unforeseen issues arise. Confidence score: 65",
            "explanation": "The DUR method allows for a more comprehensive consideration of the ethical dilemma, leading to a more nuanced response and a more calibrated confidence score. The initial high confidence is tempered by the consideration of strong counterarguments, resulting in a more cautious final assessment."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DUR method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the evolution of responses and confidence scores across iterations to gain insights into how LLMs reason about uncertainty. This could lead to a paper on the dynamics of LLM reasoning under dialectical prompting. 2) Investigate whether DUR improves the quality and comprehensiveness of uncertainty justifications, even if it doesn't improve calibration. This could yield insights into improving LLM explainability. 3) Experiment with variations of the DUR method, such as changing the number of iterations, using different prompts for generating counterarguments, or incorporating external knowledge sources. This could help identify which aspects of the dialectical process are most crucial for improving uncertainty estimates."
