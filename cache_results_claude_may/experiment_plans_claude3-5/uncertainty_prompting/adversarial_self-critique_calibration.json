        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize potential flaws or alternative viewpoints that could invalidate their reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing calibration methods often rely on external validators or statistical post-processing of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to actively search for flaws in its own reasoning, we can potentially improve its ability to self-calibrate and provide more accurate confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Self-Critique Calibration (ASCC), a prompting technique that encourages the model to adopt multiple perspectives to critique its own output. The process involves: 1) Generate an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Prompt the model to adopt the role of several 'expert critics' (e.g., statistician, logician, domain expert) and identify potential flaws in the reasoning. 3) For each critique, estimate its validity and potential impact on the answer's correctness. 4) Synthesize the critiques to produce a revised answer and calibrated confidence score. 5) Optionally, repeat the process to further refine the response. ASCC prompts are designed to elicit specific, substantive critiques rather than generic doubts, fostering a more nuanced understanding of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare ASCC with standard prompting and other self-reflection techniques on a range of tasks including factual QA, logical reasoning, and ethical dilemmas. Evaluate using both task-specific performance metrics and calibration measures such as expected calibration error (ECE) and reliability diagrams."

        "Title": "Adversarial Self-Critique Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize potential flaws or alternative viewpoints that could invalidate their reasoning. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making and misinformation spread when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods for LLMs often rely on external validators or statistical post-processing of model outputs, which may not fully leverage the model's own capabilities. By prompting the model to actively search for flaws in its own reasoning, we can potentially improve its ability to self-calibrate and provide more accurate confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human critical thinking processes, where considering multiple perspectives and potential counterarguments leads to more robust conclusions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Self-Critique Calibration (ASCC), a prompting technique that encourages the model to adopt multiple perspectives to critique its own output. The process involves five steps: 1) Generate an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Prompt the model to adopt the role of several 'expert critics' (e.g., statistician, logician, domain expert) and identify potential flaws in the reasoning. 3) For each critique, estimate its validity and potential impact on the answer's correctness. 4) Synthesize the critiques to produce a revised answer and calibrated confidence score. 5) Optionally, repeat the process to further refine the response. ASCC prompts are designed to elicit specific, substantive critiques rather than generic doubts, fostering a more nuanced understanding of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate ASCC: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) LogiQA for logical reasoning, and 3) MoralQA for ethical dilemmas. These datasets cover a range of tasks that require different types of reasoning and domain knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and 3) Self-consistency prompting. For each method, collect both the model's answer and its confidence estimate.",
            "Step 3: ASCC Implementation": "Implement the ASCC method as follows: a) Generate initial answer and confidence. b) Prompt for critiques from three expert perspectives (e.g., 'As a statistician, what flaws do you see in this reasoning?'). c) Estimate validity and impact of each critique. d) Synthesize critiques and generate revised answer and confidence. e) Optionally, repeat steps b-d for further refinement.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method, we will evaluate: 1) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy for TruthfulQA and LogiQA, agreement with expert judgments for MoralQA). 2) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and reliability diagrams. 3) Qualitative analysis of generated critiques and revisions.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of: 1) Number of expert critic roles. 2) Number of refinement iterations. 3) Prompt variations for critique generation and synthesis.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze results to compare ASCC with baselines across different tasks and models. Investigate patterns in the types of critiques generated and their impact on final answers and confidence estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "ASCC Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "ASCC Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Answer)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "ASCC Prompt Input (Step 2: Expert Critiques)": "You are now a panel of expert critics. Your task is to identify potential flaws or alternative viewpoints in the following answer: 'The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%' Please provide critiques from the perspectives of: 1) A historian, 2) A geographer, and 3) A political scientist.",
            "ASCC Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Expert Critiques)": "Historian: While Paris is indeed the current capital of France, it's worth noting that this hasn't always been the case. For example, during World War II, Vichy temporarily served as the capital of Nazi-occupied France. This historical nuance might slightly reduce our confidence.\n\nGeographer: The answer is correct, but it doesn't specify whether it refers to the political capital, economic capital, or cultural capital. While Paris serves all these roles, other cities like Lyon or Marseille are also significant urban centers in France.\n\nPolitical Scientist: The answer is technically correct, but it's overly simplistic. France has a complex system of government with power distributed across various levels. While Paris is the seat of national government, significant political functions also occur in other cities and at the EU level in Brussels.",
            "ASCC Prompt Input (Step 3: Synthesize and Revise)": "Based on the expert critiques provided, please revise the original answer and confidence level. Provide a justification for any changes made.",
            "ASCC Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Synthesize and Revise)": "Revised Answer: Paris is the current capital of France, serving as its political, economic, and cultural center. However, it's important to note that the concept of a capital city can be complex, with historical changes and power distribution across multiple cities and levels of government. Confidence: 95%\n\nJustification: The confidence has been slightly reduced to account for the historical nuances (e.g., Vichy regime), the multifaceted nature of what constitutes a capital, and the distribution of political functions across different cities and governmental levels. While Paris is undoubtedly the primary capital of France, these considerations warrant a small reduction in absolute certainty.",
            "Explanation": "The ASCC method prompts the model to consider multiple expert perspectives, leading to a more nuanced and slightly less overconfident response compared to the baseline. This process helps the model recognize potential complexities and uncertainties that weren't apparent in its initial, highly confident answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ASCC doesn't significantly improve calibration or task performance compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated critiques to understand what types of self-reflection LLMs are capable of and where they struggle. This could provide insights into the limitations of current models and suggest directions for improvement. 2) Explore variations of the ASCC method, such as using different prompt structures for critique generation or experimenting with ways to aggregate multiple critiques. 3) Investigate whether ASCC is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Compare the effectiveness of ASCC across different model sizes and architectures to understand how self-critique capabilities scale with model capacity. These alternative directions could still yield valuable insights into LLM behavior and self-reflection capabilities, even if the original hypothesis about improved calibration is not supported."
