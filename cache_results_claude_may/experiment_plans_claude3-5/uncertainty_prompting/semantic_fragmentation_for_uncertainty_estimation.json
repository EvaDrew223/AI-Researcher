        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods often treat queries as atomic units, failing to capture how uncertainty may vary across different semantic components of a complex question or task.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide a single uncertainty estimate for an entire query, which can be overly simplistic for complex, multi-faceted questions.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down queries into semantic fragments and estimating uncertainty for each fragment separately, we can provide a more nuanced and informative uncertainty profile.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Fragmentation for Uncertainty Estimation, a method that decomposes queries into semantic units and estimates uncertainty for each unit separately. The process involves: 1) Using the LLM itself to break down the query into semantic fragments, e.g., 'What are the economic impacts of climate change in coastal cities?' might be fragmented into 'economic impacts', 'climate change', and 'coastal cities'. 2) For each fragment, prompting the model to provide a confidence estimate on its knowledge related to that fragment. 3) Prompting the model to estimate how these fragment-level uncertainties interact and compound in the context of the full query. 4) Synthesizing a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for both fragment-level and interaction uncertainties.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on complex, multi-faceted queries across various domains. Compare against whole-query uncertainty estimation methods. Assess the method's ability to provide more informative uncertainty profiles and its correlation with actual performance on sub-components of the tasks."

        "Title": "Semantic Fragmentation for Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models (LLMs) often treat queries as atomic units, failing to capture how uncertainty may vary across different semantic components of a complex question or task. This approach can lead to overly simplistic uncertainty estimates for multi-faceted questions, potentially misleading users about the model's true confidence levels for different aspects of the query.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide a single uncertainty estimate for an entire query, which can be inadequate for complex, multi-faceted questions. By breaking down queries into semantic fragments and estimating uncertainty for each fragment separately, we can provide a more nuanced and informative uncertainty profile. This method leverages the LLM's own capabilities to decompose and analyze queries, potentially offering more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates without requiring additional training data or model modifications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Fragmentation for Uncertainty Estimation (SFUE), a method that decomposes queries into semantic units and estimates uncertainty for each unit separately. The process involves four main steps: 1) Using the LLM to break down the query into semantic fragments. 2) For each fragment, prompting the model to provide a confidence estimate on its knowledge related to that fragment. 3) Prompting the model to estimate how these fragment-level uncertainties interact and compound in the context of the full query. 4) Synthesizing a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for both fragment-level and interaction uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover a range of complex, multi-faceted queries: 1) TruthfulQA for factual questions, 2) MMLU for domain-specific knowledge, and 3) StrategyQA for multi-step reasoning questions. We will randomly sample 1000 questions from each dataset for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Direct uncertainty estimation: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for the entire query. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: If using an open-source model, apply MC Dropout to estimate uncertainty. For API-based models, use multiple queries with temperature sampling as an approximation.",
            "Step 3: SFUE Implementation": "Implement the SFUE method with the following sub-steps: a) Query Fragmentation: Prompt the LLM to break down the query into semantic fragments. Use the prompt: 'Break down the following query into its key semantic components: [QUERY]' b) Fragment Uncertainty Estimation: For each fragment, prompt the LLM to estimate its confidence. Use the prompt: 'On a scale of 0 to 100, how confident are you about your knowledge related to: [FRAGMENT]' c) Interaction Uncertainty Estimation: Prompt the LLM to estimate how the uncertainties interact. Use the prompt: 'Given the following confidence levels for each component: [FRAGMENT CONFIDENCES], estimate how these uncertainties compound for answering the full query: [QUERY]' d) Final Uncertainty Synthesis: Prompt the LLM to provide a final uncertainty estimate. Use the prompt: 'Based on the individual component confidences and their interaction, provide a final confidence score for answering the query: [QUERY]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. If computational resources allow, we will also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Generate answers and uncertainty estimates using both baseline methods and SFUE. 2) Evaluate the accuracy of the answers. 3) Compute calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) for both baseline and SFUE methods. 4) Conduct a qualitative analysis of a subset of examples to assess the interpretability and granularity of SFUE compared to baselines.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1) Compare the calibration metrics between SFUE and baselines across different datasets and models. 2) Analyze how SFUE performs on queries of varying complexity. 3) Investigate cases where SFUE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. 4) Examine the relationship between fragment-level uncertainties and the final synthesized uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What were the economic impacts of the 2008 financial crisis on the automotive industry in Detroit?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Confidence: 85%. The 2008 financial crisis had severe economic impacts on the automotive industry in Detroit. Key effects included: 1) Significant drop in car sales, 2) Job losses in the automotive sector, 3) Bankruptcy filings by major automakers like General Motors and Chrysler, 4) Government bailouts to prevent complete industry collapse, 5) Restructuring of companies and union contracts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Fragmentation)": "Break down the following query into its key semantic components: What were the economic impacts of the 2008 financial crisis on the automotive industry in Detroit?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Fragmentation)": "1. 2008 financial crisis\n2. Economic impacts\n3. Automotive industry\n4. Detroit",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Fragment Uncertainty)": "On a scale of 0 to 100, how confident are you about your knowledge related to: 1. 2008 financial crisis",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Fragment Uncertainty)": "Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Interaction Uncertainty)": "Given the following confidence levels for each component: 1. 2008 financial crisis: 95, 2. Economic impacts: 90, 3. Automotive industry: 85, 4. Detroit: 80, estimate how these uncertainties compound for answering the full query: What were the economic impacts of the 2008 financial crisis on the automotive industry in Detroit?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Interaction Uncertainty)": "Compound confidence: 82. The overall confidence is lower than the individual components due to the specific intersection of these topics. While I'm highly confident about the 2008 financial crisis and general economic impacts, the specific effects on Detroit's automotive industry introduce more uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on the individual component confidences and their interaction, provide a final confidence score for answering the query: What were the economic impacts of the 2008 financial crisis on the automotive industry in Detroit?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final confidence score: 80. This reflects high confidence in the general knowledge of the 2008 financial crisis and its broad economic impacts, but acknowledges some uncertainty in the specific effects on Detroit's automotive industry. The interaction of these factors slightly reduces the overall confidence compared to the individual components.",
            "Explanation": "The SFUE method provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by breaking down the query into semantic components and considering their interactions. This allows for a more detailed understanding of where the model's uncertainties lie, potentially leading to more accurate and interpretable confidence estimates compared to the single-score baseline approach."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SFUE method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of why SFUE fails to improve uncertainty estimates. This could involve examining the quality of semantic fragmentation, the accuracy of fragment-level uncertainty estimates, and the effectiveness of the interaction and synthesis steps. 2) Explore alternative fragmentation strategies, such as using a fixed set of semantic categories (e.g., entity, relation, temporal aspect) instead of query-specific fragmentation. 3) Investigate how different prompting strategies for each step of SFUE affect the final uncertainty estimates. This could lead to insights on optimal prompting for uncertainty estimation. 4) Analyze how SFUE performs across different types of queries (e.g., factual vs. reasoning) and different domains. This could reveal where semantic fragmentation is most beneficial for uncertainty estimation. 5) Explore combining SFUE with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration techniques, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods."
