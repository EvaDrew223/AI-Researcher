        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with questions that require distinguishing between closely related concepts or scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or analysis of model outputs for a single query.",
        "Motivation": "By contrasting a given query with carefully constructed related queries, we can triangulate the model's true confidence more accurately, revealing subtle differences in the model's knowledge and reasoning capabilities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Triangulation (CCT), a method that generates a set of related queries by slightly modifying the original query (e.g., changing key entities, altering relationships). The LLM is then prompted to answer each query and provide a confidence score. Additionally, the model is asked to compare and contrast its answers and confidence levels across the query set. The final confidence score for the original query is derived from this comparative analysis, taking into account the model's ability to distinguish between subtle differences in the queries.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCT against standard confidence elicitation methods on datasets that include closely related questions or require fine-grained distinctions, such as adversarial versions of existing QA datasets. Measure improvements in calibration and the model's ability to distinguish between similar but distinct scenarios."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Triangulation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with questions that require distinguishing between closely related concepts or scenarios. This inaccurate self-assessment can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where confidence calibration is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches for confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or analysis of model outputs for a single query. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced differences in the model's knowledge and reasoning capabilities across similar but distinct scenarios. By contrasting a given query with carefully constructed related queries, we can triangulate the model's true confidence more accurately, revealing subtle differences in the model's knowledge and reasoning capabilities. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where we often assess our confidence by comparing a given problem to similar ones we've encountered before.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Triangulation (CCT), a method that generates a set of related queries by slightly modifying the original query (e.g., changing key entities, altering relationships). The LLM is then prompted to answer each query and provide a confidence score. Additionally, the model is asked to compare and contrast its answers and confidence levels across the query set. The final confidence score for the original query is derived from this comparative analysis, taking into account the model's ability to distinguish between subtle differences in the queries.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and (3) AmbigQA for ambiguous questions. These datasets cover a range of question types and difficulty levels, allowing us to test CCT's effectiveness across various scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. (2) Entropy-based confidence: Calculate the entropy of the model's output distribution as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: CCT Implementation": "Implement the CCT method as follows: (a) Query Generation: For each original question, generate 3-5 related queries by modifying key elements. Use GPT-4 to generate these related queries. (b) Multi-query Answering: Prompt the LLM to answer each query (original + related) and provide a confidence score. (c) Comparative Analysis: Prompt the LLM to compare and contrast its answers and confidence levels across the query set. (d) Final Confidence Calculation: Derive the final confidence score based on the comparative analysis.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: (1) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. (2) Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (3) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. (b) Run the CCT method and collect results. (c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and CCT methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CCT against the baselines across different datasets and models. Analyze how CCT performs on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. ambiguous) and identify scenarios where it shows the most improvement.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of CCT: (a) Vary the number of related queries generated. (b) Remove the comparative analysis step. (c) Use different methods for generating related queries."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 1 is absolutely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong.\nConfidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCT; Step 1: Related Query Generation)": "Generate 3 related queries by slightly modifying the following question: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCT; Step 1: Related Query Generation)": "1. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the first American to orbit the Earth?\n3. Who was the first woman in space?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCT; Step 2: Multi-query Answering)": "Please answer each of the following questions and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each answer:\n1. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n3. Who was the first American to orbit the Earth?\n4. Who was the first woman in space?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCT; Step 2: Multi-query Answering)": "1. Neil Armstrong (Confidence: 0.95)\n2. Buzz Aldrin (Confidence: 0.9)\n3. John Glenn (Confidence: 0.85)\n4. Valentina Tereshkova (Confidence: 0.8)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCT; Step 3: Comparative Analysis)": "Compare and contrast your answers and confidence levels for the following questions:\n1. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n3. Who was the first American to orbit the Earth?\n4. Who was the first woman in space?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCT; Step 3: Comparative Analysis)": "I'm most confident about Neil Armstrong being the first person to walk on the moon, as this is a widely known historical fact. I'm slightly less confident about Buzz Aldrin being the second, as it's less frequently mentioned. My confidence decreases further for John Glenn and Valentina Tereshkova, as these facts are less commonly discussed and there's a higher chance of confusion with other early space pioneers. The questions about moon landings are closely related and my high confidence in both suggests strong certainty in my knowledge of the Apollo 11 mission. The other two questions, while still about space exploration, cover different aspects (orbiting Earth and women in space), which explains the slightly lower confidence due to the broader knowledge domain required.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCT; Step 4: Final Confidence Calculation)": "Based on your answers, confidence scores, and comparative analysis for the related questions, what is your final confidence score (between 0 and 1) for the answer to the original question: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCT; Step 4: Final Confidence Calculation)": "Final Confidence Score: 0.97",
            "Explanation": "CCT improves confidence estimation by considering related queries and the model's ability to distinguish between them. The final confidence score (0.97) is higher than the initial direct estimate (0.95) because the model demonstrated consistent knowledge across related space exploration questions, particularly those about moon landings. This method provides a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence assessment than simple direct elicitation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCT method does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine: (1) The quality and relevance of generated related queries - are they diverse enough to provide meaningful contrasts? (2) The model's ability to perform meaningful comparative analysis - does it struggle to articulate differences between closely related concepts? (3) The effectiveness of our final confidence calculation method - are we effectively synthesizing the information from multiple queries and comparisons? Based on these analyses, we could develop a modified version of CCT that addresses the identified weaknesses. For example, we might explore using a more structured approach to generating related queries, or develop a more sophisticated algorithm for synthesizing multi-query results into a final confidence score. Alternatively, we could shift our focus to analyzing how different types of questions and knowledge domains affect the model's confidence estimation, potentially uncovering insights about the strengths and limitations of LLMs in self-assessment across various tasks."
