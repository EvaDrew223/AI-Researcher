        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, even when faced with conflicting or ambiguous information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on static confidence estimation or calibration techniques, which may not capture the dynamic nature of confidence in the face of changing or conflicting evidence.",
        "Motivation": "By deliberately introducing conflicting information and observing how the model's confidence fluctuates, we can gain insights into its robustness and ability to handle uncertainty in dynamic, adversarial scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Oscillation (ACO), a novel prompting technique that systematically introduces conflicting information to challenge the model's confidence. The prompt will begin with a clear, factual statement and ask the model to express its confidence. Then, we will iteratively introduce pieces of information that contradict or support the initial statement, each time prompting the model to reassess its confidence and explain the reasoning behind any changes. We will implement a sophisticated adversarial algorithm that adaptively selects contradictory information based on the model's previous responses, aiming to maximize confidence oscillation. Additionally, we will incorporate a meta-cognitive component where the model is asked to reflect on its own confidence fluctuations and identify patterns or biases in its decision-making process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ACO on a diverse set of topics, including historical facts, scientific claims, and current events. We will compare it against baselines such as static confidence estimation and standard adversarial prompting. Metrics will include the magnitude and frequency of confidence oscillations, the model's ability to identify unreliable sources, and the quality of meta-cognitive insights. We will also analyze how different types of conflicting information (e.g., statistical vs. anecdotal) affect the model's confidence dynamics."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Oscillation: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Dynamic Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, even when faced with conflicting or ambiguous information. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in scenarios where the model encounters novel or adversarial inputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in language models typically rely on static techniques that may not capture the dynamic nature of confidence in the face of changing or conflicting evidence. By systematically introducing conflicting information and observing how the model's confidence fluctuates, we can gain deeper insights into its robustness and ability to handle uncertainty in dynamic, adversarial scenarios. This approach could lead to more reliable and self-aware language models, capable of expressing appropriate levels of uncertainty when faced with conflicting or incomplete information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Oscillation (ACO), a novel prompting technique that systematically introduces conflicting information to challenge the model's confidence. The method consists of the following steps:\n1. Initial Prompt: Begin with a clear, factual statement and ask the model to express its confidence.\n2. Iterative Contradiction: Introduce pieces of information that contradict or support the initial statement, prompting the model to reassess its confidence and explain any changes.\n3. Adaptive Adversarial Algorithm: Implement a sophisticated algorithm that selects contradictory information based on the model's previous responses, aiming to maximize confidence oscillation.\n4. Meta-cognitive Component: Ask the model to reflect on its own confidence fluctuations and identify patterns or biases in its decision-making process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a diverse set of topics for evaluation, including historical facts, scientific claims, and current events. For each topic, prepare a set of true statements, contradictory statements, and supporting evidence.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (a) Static confidence estimation: Ask the model to provide a confidence score for a statement without any additional context. (b) Standard adversarial prompting: Introduce contradictory information randomly and ask for confidence reassessment.",
            "Step 4: ACO Implementation": "Implement the Adversarial Confidence Oscillation method as described in the Proposed Method section.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Define and implement the following metrics: (a) Magnitude of confidence oscillation, (b) Frequency of confidence changes, (c) Ability to identify unreliable sources, (d) Quality of meta-cognitive insights, (e) Correlation between confidence and factual correctness.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each topic in the dataset, run the following steps:\n1. Present the initial statement and ask for confidence.\n2. Iteratively introduce contradictory or supporting information (up to 5 iterations).\n3. Apply the adaptive adversarial algorithm to select the next piece of information.\n4. After the iterations, prompt for meta-cognitive reflection.\n5. Record all responses, confidence scores, and explanations.",
            "Step 7: Data Analysis": "Analyze the collected data to compare ACO against the baselines. Evaluate the impact of different types of contradictory information (e.g., statistical vs. anecdotal) on confidence dynamics.",
            "Step 8: Results Compilation": "Compile the results into tables and graphs, showing the performance of ACO compared to baselines across different topics and metrics."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Statement: The Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old.\nQuestion: How confident are you in this statement? Please provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 and a brief explanation.",
                "Expected Output": "Confidence Score: 95\nExplanation: I'm highly confident in this statement as it aligns with the widely accepted scientific consensus based on extensive geological and radiometric dating evidence. However, I'm not giving it a perfect 100 because there's always a small margin of error in such ancient dating methods.",
                "Explanation": "This baseline example shows a high confidence score without considering any potential contradictory information."
            },
            "ACO Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Prompt": {
                    "Input": "Statement: The Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old.\nQuestion: How confident are you in this statement? Please provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 and a brief explanation.",
                    "Expected Output": "Confidence Score: 95\nExplanation: I'm highly confident in this statement as it aligns with the widely accepted scientific consensus based on extensive geological and radiometric dating evidence. However, I'm not giving it a perfect 100 because there's always a small margin of error in such ancient dating methods."
                },
                "Step 2 - Contradictory Information": {
                    "Input": "New Information: A recent study suggests that certain zircon crystals indicate the Earth might be up to 4.8 billion years old.\nQuestion: Given this new information, how does your confidence in the original statement change? Please provide an updated confidence score and explanation.",
                    "Expected Output": "Updated Confidence Score: 80\nExplanation: This new information introduces some uncertainty to the original statement. While the original estimate of 4.5 billion years is still within the realm of possibility, the potential for the Earth to be older than previously thought reduces my confidence. The discrepancy between the widely accepted age and this new finding suggests that our understanding might need refinement."
                },
                "Step 3 - Supporting Information": {
                    "Input": "Additional Information: Multiple independent studies using different radiometric dating methods consistently support the 4.5 billion year estimate.\nQuestion: How does this additional information affect your confidence? Please provide an updated score and explanation.",
                    "Expected Output": "Updated Confidence Score: 90\nExplanation: The additional information about multiple independent studies supporting the 4.5 billion year estimate increases my confidence. The consistency across different methods is a strong indicator of reliability. However, I'm still accounting for the earlier study about zircon crystals, which prevents me from returning to my initial high confidence level."
                },
                "Step 4 - Meta-cognitive Reflection": {
                    "Input": "Please reflect on how your confidence has changed throughout this conversation. What patterns or biases do you notice in your decision-making process?",
                    "Expected Output": "Reflection: Throughout this conversation, I noticed several patterns in my confidence assessment:\n1. Initial high confidence based on widely accepted scientific consensus.\n2. Significant decrease in confidence when presented with contradictory information from a recent study.\n3. Partial recovery of confidence when provided with supporting evidence from multiple studies.\n\nPotential biases in my decision-making process:\n1. Anchoring bias: My initial high confidence might have anchored my subsequent assessments, preventing a more dramatic shift in confidence.\n2. Recency bias: The most recent information provided (multiple supporting studies) had a strong influence on my final confidence score.\n3. Authority bias: I may have given more weight to the 'widely accepted scientific consensus' than to a single recent study, even though new discoveries can sometimes overturn established beliefs.\n\nThis reflection highlights the importance of considering multiple sources of information and being open to updating beliefs based on new evidence. It also demonstrates the complexity of assessing confidence in scientific claims, where ongoing research can both challenge and reinforce existing knowledge."
                },
                "Explanation": "This ACO example demonstrates how the model's confidence oscillates as it encounters contradictory and supporting information. It also shows the model's ability to reflect on its own decision-making process, identifying potential biases and patterns in its confidence assessment."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ACO method doesn't significantly improve over baselines in quantifying uncertainty, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the patterns of confidence oscillation to identify which types of contradictory information are most effective in challenging the model's confidence. This could lead to insights about the model's knowledge representation and reasoning processes.\n2. Focus on the meta-cognitive component, analyzing the model's ability to reflect on its own decision-making process. This could provide valuable insights into the model's self-awareness and potential strategies for improving it.\n3. Investigate the relationship between confidence oscillation and factual accuracy. Even if ACO doesn't improve uncertainty quantification, it might reveal interesting correlations between confidence dynamics and the likelihood of factual correctness.\n4. Explore how different prompting strategies within the ACO framework affect the model's responses. This could lead to the development of more effective prompting techniques for eliciting accurate confidence estimates.\n5. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to understand why ACO might not be effective, which could inform the development of alternative approaches to uncertainty quantification in language models."
