        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for complex queries that involve multiple interconnected concepts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically treat queries as atomic units, missing the opportunity to break down complex questions into simpler components.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing queries into conceptual trees, we can assess uncertainty at a granular level and propagate it upwards, potentially leading to more accurate overall uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a hierarchical prompting strategy: 1) Prompt the model to decompose the query into a tree of sub-concepts. 2) For each leaf node, generate an answer and uncertainty estimate. 3) Propagate uncertainties upwards, combining them at each internal node using predefined rules (e.g., max, average, or more complex functions). 4) At the root, synthesize a final answer and overall uncertainty estimate. 5) Optionally, perform a second pass to refine estimates based on the holistic view of the decomposition. This method allows for fine-grained uncertainty assessment and potentially more accurate aggregation for complex queries.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test on multi-hop reasoning datasets and complex question-answering tasks. Compare against flat prompting strategies and other structured reasoning approaches. Evaluate using both overall calibration metrics and metrics that assess the quality of the conceptual decomposition."

        "Title": "Hierarchical Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models via Conceptual Decomposition",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for complex queries that involve multiple interconnected concepts. This limitation hinders their reliability in critical applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically treat queries as atomic units, missing the opportunity to break down complex questions into simpler components. By decomposing queries into conceptual trees, we can assess uncertainty at a granular level and propagate it upwards, potentially leading to more accurate overall uncertainty estimates. This method aligns with human cognitive processes, where complex problems are often broken down into smaller, more manageable parts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a hierarchical prompting strategy: 1) Prompt the model to decompose the query into a tree of sub-concepts. 2) For each leaf node, generate an answer and uncertainty estimate. 3) Propagate uncertainties upwards, combining them at each internal node using predefined rules (e.g., max, average, or more complex functions). 4) At the root, synthesize a final answer and overall uncertainty estimate. 5) Optionally, perform a second pass to refine estimates based on the holistic view of the decomposition.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-hop reasoning datasets such as HotpotQA and complex question-answering tasks from the BIG-Bench collection. These datasets provide questions that require reasoning across multiple facts or concepts, making them suitable for our hierarchical approach.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: Ask the model to answer the question and provide an uncertainty estimate. 2) Flat prompting with uncertainty: Ask the model to break down the reasoning process into steps, provide an answer, and give an uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 3: Hierarchical Prompting Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down the following question into a tree of sub-concepts, with each node representing a key concept or fact needed to answer the question.' b) Leaf node prompt: 'For the following sub-concept, provide an answer and an uncertainty estimate on a scale of 0-100%.' c) Internal node prompt: 'Given the following sub-concepts and their uncertainty estimates, provide a combined answer and uncertainty estimate.' d) Root node prompt: 'Based on the entire decomposition and uncertainty propagation, provide a final answer and overall uncertainty estimate.'",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Propagation Rules": "Implement and compare different uncertainty propagation rules: 1) Max uncertainty: Take the maximum uncertainty of child nodes. 2) Average uncertainty: Take the average uncertainty of child nodes. 3) Weighted average: Weight child uncertainties based on their relevance to the parent concept.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models have shown strong performance in complex reasoning tasks and provide a good balance between capability and accessibility.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Answer accuracy: Compare model answers to ground truth. 2) Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted uncertainty and actual error rates. 3) Decomposition quality: Manually evaluate a subset of decompositions for relevance and completeness.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on the prepared datasets using both baseline methods and our hierarchical method. Collect results including answers, uncertainty estimates, and intermediate decompositions.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the hierarchical method against baselines. Analyze how decomposition affects uncertainty estimates and final answer accuracy. Investigate cases where the hierarchical method performs particularly well or poorly."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: The Nile River flows through two countries that were once a single country. One of these countries gained independence in 2011. What is the capital of this newly independent country? Please also provide an uncertainty estimate for your answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of the newly independent country that the Nile River flows through is Juba, South Sudan. Uncertainty estimate: 20%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hierarchical Prompting; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Break down the following question into a tree of sub-concepts, with each node representing a key concept or fact needed to answer the question: The Nile River flows through two countries that were once a single country. One of these countries gained independence in 2011. What is the capital of this newly independent country?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hierarchical Prompting; Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. Nile River countries\n   1.1 Countries the Nile flows through\n   1.2 Which two were once a single country\n2. Country that gained independence in 2011\n   2.1 Identify the country\n   2.2 Verify independence year\n3. Capital of the newly independent country",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hierarchical Prompting; Step 2: Leaf Node)": "For the following sub-concept, provide an answer and an uncertainty estimate on a scale of 0-100%: Identify the country that gained independence in 2011.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hierarchical Prompting; Step 2: Leaf Node)": "A: The country that gained independence in 2011 is South Sudan. Uncertainty estimate: 5%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hierarchical Prompting; Step 3: Root Node)": "Based on the entire decomposition and uncertainty propagation, provide a final answer and overall uncertainty estimate for the question: What is the capital of the newly independent country that the Nile River flows through and gained independence in 2011?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hierarchical Prompting; Step 3: Root Node)": "A: The capital of the newly independent country (South Sudan) that the Nile River flows through and gained independence in 2011 is Juba. Overall uncertainty estimate: 15%",
            "Explanation": "The hierarchical approach allows for a more structured uncertainty quantification. By breaking down the question into sub-concepts, we can assess uncertainty at each step and propagate it upwards. This results in a more nuanced final uncertainty estimate compared to the direct prompting method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed hierarchical method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can explore several alternatives: 1) Analyze the quality of decompositions to see if they're capturing the right concepts. We might need to refine our decomposition prompts or provide more guidance to the model. 2) Investigate different uncertainty propagation rules, possibly incorporating machine learning models to learn optimal combination strategies. 3) Explore iterative refinement, where we use the initial decomposition to generate follow-up questions that further clarify uncertain aspects. 4) If these approaches don't yield improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper comparing different uncertainty quantification methods across various types of questions, providing insights into when hierarchical decomposition is most beneficial and when simpler methods suffice."
