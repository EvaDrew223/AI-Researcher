        "Problem": "Complex tasks often require breaking down problems into subtasks, but current methods don't effectively propagate uncertainty through these subtask chains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like prompt chaining or retrieval-augmented generation don't explicitly handle uncertainty propagation.",
        "Motivation": "By tracking and propagating uncertainty through a chain of subtasks, we can obtain more reliable final confidence estimates and potentially improve overall task performance.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Chaining (UAPC). For a given task, we first prompt the model to break it down into subtasks. For each subtask, the model provides an answer and a confidence score. Subsequent subtasks are conditioned on previous results and their uncertainties. The prompt structure looks like: '1) Break down the main task into subtasks. 2) For each subtask: a) Provide an answer. b) Estimate your confidence (0-100%). c) Explain how the uncertainty of previous subtasks affects this one. 3) Combine subtask results, accounting for propagated uncertainties, to give a final answer and confidence score.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare UAPC with standard prompt chaining and retrieval-augmented generation on multi-step reasoning tasks such as complex mathematical problem-solving or multi-hop question answering, evaluating both task performance and uncertainty calibration."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Chaining: Improving Confidence Calibration in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for complex multi-step reasoning tasks using large language models (LLMs) often fail to effectively propagate uncertainty through chains of subtasks, leading to overconfident or poorly calibrated final outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like prompt chaining or retrieval-augmented generation don't explicitly handle uncertainty propagation. By tracking and propagating uncertainty through a chain of subtasks, we can obtain more reliable final confidence estimates and potentially improve overall task performance. This is particularly important for high-stakes applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Chaining (UAPC). For a given task, we first prompt the model to break it down into subtasks. For each subtask, the model provides an answer and a confidence score. Subsequent subtasks are conditioned on previous results and their uncertainties. The prompt structure looks like: '1) Break down the main task into subtasks. 2) For each subtask: a) Provide an answer. b) Estimate your confidence (0-100%). c) Explain how the uncertainty of previous subtasks affects this one. 3) Combine subtask results, accounting for propagated uncertainties, to give a final answer and confidence score.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use two datasets: 1) GSM8K for multi-step mathematical reasoning, and 2) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering. These datasets are suitable for evaluating multi-step reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models have shown strong performance on complex reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baselines: a) Standard prompt chaining without uncertainty propagation, b) Retrieval-augmented generation using a vector database (e.g., FAISS) of relevant information.",
            "Step 4: UAPC Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Chaining method. This involves creating prompts for task decomposition, subtask solving with confidence estimation, and final answer generation with propagated uncertainty.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Task performance: accuracy for HotpotQA, solve rate for GSM8K, b) Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), c) Uncertainty quality: Brier score.",
            "Step 6: Experiments": "Run experiments comparing UAPC against the baselines on both datasets. For each method, we'll use a sample size of 1000 questions from each dataset.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze the results, focusing on: a) Overall task performance improvements, b) Calibration improvements, c) Quality of uncertainty estimates, d) Effectiveness of uncertainty propagation across subtasks."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompt Chaining)": "Q: If a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for 8 servings, how many cups of flour are needed for 20 servings? Let's approach this step-by-step.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompt Chaining)": "1) First, let's understand the given information:\n   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 8 servings\n   - We need to find the amount for 20 servings\n\n2) Let's find out how much flour is needed per serving:\n   2 cups \u00f7 8 servings = 0.25 cups per serving\n\n3) Now, let's calculate the amount needed for 20 servings:\n   0.25 cups \u00d7 20 servings = 5 cups\n\nTherefore, 5 cups of flour are needed for 20 servings.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAPC)": "Q: If a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for 8 servings, how many cups of flour are needed for 20 servings?\n\n1) Break down this task into subtasks.\n2) For each subtask:\n   a) Provide an answer.\n   b) Estimate your confidence (0-100%).\n   c) Explain how the uncertainty of previous subtasks affects this one.\n3) Combine subtask results, accounting for propagated uncertainties, to give a final answer and confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAPC)": "Task Breakdown:\n1. Calculate flour per serving\n2. Calculate flour for 20 servings\n\nSubtask 1: Calculate flour per serving\na) Answer: 2 cups \u00f7 8 servings = 0.25 cups per serving\nb) Confidence: 98%\nc) No previous subtasks, so no propagated uncertainty.\n\nSubtask 2: Calculate flour for 20 servings\na) Answer: 0.25 cups \u00d7 20 servings = 5 cups\nb) Confidence: 97%\nc) The high confidence (98%) in the previous subtask means there's minimal propagated uncertainty. The slight decrease in confidence is due to the additional calculation step.\n\nFinal Answer: 5 cups of flour are needed for 20 servings.\nOverall Confidence: 95%\n\nExplanation: The overall confidence is slightly lower than individual subtasks due to the cumulative effect of uncertainties. The high confidence in both subtasks results in a still high overall confidence.",
            "explanation": "The UAPC method provides a structured approach to breaking down the problem, solving each part with associated confidence levels, and propagating uncertainty. This allows for a more nuanced final answer with a well-calibrated confidence score, unlike the standard prompt chaining which doesn't explicitly handle uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UAPC doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can explore several directions: 1) Analyze the quality of task decompositions and see if improving this step leads to better results. 2) Investigate different methods of combining subtask uncertainties, such as using more sophisticated probabilistic models. 3) Experiment with prompting the model to generate multiple alternative decompositions and solutions, then aggregate these to potentially improve robustness. 4) If performance gains are minimal but uncertainty estimates are improved, we could pivot to focus on the benefits of UAPC for interpretability and decision-making in high-stakes scenarios, even if raw performance isn't significantly better."
