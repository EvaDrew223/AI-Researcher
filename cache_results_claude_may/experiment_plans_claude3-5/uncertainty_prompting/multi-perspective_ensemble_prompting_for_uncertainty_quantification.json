    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often provide poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially for complex queries that require considering multiple perspectives or domains of knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-perspective prompting or post-hoc ensemble methods that don't leverage the model's ability to adopt different personas or expertise domains.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to adopt multiple perspectives or expertise domains within a single query, we can potentially obtain a more comprehensive uncertainty landscape and improve calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Ensemble Prompting (MPEP), a technique that guides the model to generate answers and confidence estimates from multiple viewpoints. The prompt structure includes: '1. Identify 3-5 relevant perspectives or expertise domains for the query (e.g., historian, economist, technologist for a question about future societal changes). 2. For each perspective, generate an answer and confidence estimate. 3. Analyze agreements and disagreements between perspectives. 4. Synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate that accounts for the ensemble of perspectives.' This approach leverages the model's ability to adopt different personas or knowledge domains, potentially leading to more nuanced and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MPEP against standard single-perspective prompting and post-hoc ensemble methods on complex, multi-faceted tasks such as forecasting, ethical reasoning, or interdisciplinary analysis. Evaluate using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier Score, and measures of ensemble diversity and agreement."

            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-Perspective)": "Q: How will the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles impact urban planning and infrastructure by 2040? Provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-Perspective)": "A: The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles by 2040 will likely lead to significant changes in urban planning and infrastructure. Some potential impacts include:\n1. Reduced need for parking spaces in city centers, allowing for more efficient land use.\n2. Redesign of road systems to accommodate autonomous vehicle communication and navigation.\n3. Increased focus on pedestrian and cyclist-friendly spaces as car ownership decreases.\n4. Development of dedicated lanes or zones for autonomous vehicles.\n5. Integration of charging infrastructure for electric autonomous vehicles.\n\nConfidence Score: 80",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPEP)": "Q: How will the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles impact urban planning and infrastructure by 2040?\n\n1. Identify 3-5 relevant perspectives or expertise domains for this query.\n2. For each perspective, generate an answer and confidence estimate (0-100).\n3. Analyze agreements and disagreements between perspectives.\n4. Synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate that accounts for the ensemble of perspectives.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPEP)": "1. Relevant perspectives:\n   a) Urban Planner\n   b) Transportation Engineer\n   c) Environmental Scientist\n   d) Economist\n\n2. Perspective-based answers and confidence estimates:\n\na) Urban Planner (Confidence: 85)\nAnswer: Autonomous vehicles will significantly reshape urban landscapes by 2040. We'll see a reduction in parking needs, allowing for the repurposing of urban spaces for housing, green areas, or commercial use. Street designs will evolve to accommodate pick-up/drop-off zones and potentially narrower lanes. The concept of transit-oriented development may shift to accommodate autonomous vehicle hubs.\n\nb) Transportation Engineer (Confidence: 90)\nAnswer: By 2040, road infrastructure will be heavily modified to support autonomous vehicles. This includes the implementation of smart traffic management systems, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication networks, and standardized road markings and signage optimized for machine vision. We may see dedicated AV lanes on highways and major arterials. Intersections could be redesigned to optimize for AV traffic flow.\n\nc) Environmental Scientist (Confidence: 75)\nAnswer: The adoption of autonomous vehicles, likely predominantly electric, will contribute to reduced emissions in urban areas. This may lead to improved air quality and potentially allow for more green spaces in cities. However, the ease of autonomous travel might increase overall vehicle miles traveled, potentially offsetting some environmental benefits. Infrastructure changes will need to consider climate resilience and sustainable materials.\n\nd) Economist (Confidence: 70)\nAnswer: The economic impact of autonomous vehicles on urban planning will be substantial but complex. While there may be significant savings in parking infrastructure and potential increases in land value due to repurposing, there will also be high costs associated with upgrading infrastructure to support AVs. The shift may impact municipal revenues from parking and traffic violations. Labor market disruptions in transportation-related jobs could affect urban economies.\n\n3. Analysis of agreements and disagreements:\nAll perspectives agree that autonomous vehicles will lead to significant changes in urban infrastructure, particularly regarding parking and road design. The Urban Planner and Transportation Engineer perspectives align closely on the need for redesigning streets and implementing new technologies. The Environmental Scientist offers a unique perspective on the potential environmental impacts, which is not directly addressed by other experts. The Economist provides insights into the economic implications, which complements but sometimes contrasts with the other perspectives, particularly in highlighting potential challenges and costs.\n\n4. Synthesized final answer and uncertainty estimate:\n\nBy 2040, the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles is likely to have a transformative impact on urban planning and infrastructure. Key changes will include:\n\n1. Significant reduction in parking requirements, leading to the repurposing of urban spaces for housing, commercial use, or green areas.\n2. Redesign of road systems to incorporate smart traffic management, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, and potentially dedicated AV lanes.\n3. Modification of street designs to accommodate pick-up/drop-off zones and potentially narrower lanes.\n4. Implementation of charging infrastructure for electric autonomous vehicles.\n5. Potential improvements in air quality due to the likely predominance of electric AVs, although this may be partially offset by increased vehicle miles traveled.\n6. Economic shifts including changes in land value, municipal revenues, and job markets related to transportation.\n\nHowever, these changes will not be uniform across all urban areas and will depend on factors such as local policies, economic conditions, and the rate of AV adoption. The high costs of infrastructure upgrades and potential labor market disruptions present significant challenges that will need to be addressed.\n\nUncertainty Estimate: Moderate (Confidence: 80)\nWhile there is high confidence in the general direction of changes, the specific extent and timeline of these impacts by 2040 remain uncertain due to variables in technology development, policy decisions, and public adoption rates.",
            "explanation": "The MPEP method provides a more comprehensive and nuanced answer by incorporating multiple expert perspectives. It explicitly addresses areas of agreement and disagreement, leading to a final synthesized answer that captures a broader range of potential impacts. The uncertainty estimate is more well-calibrated, acknowledging both the areas of high confidence and the remaining uncertainties."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the MPEP method does not significantly improve calibration or performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of why the method failed, examining the quality and diversity of generated perspectives, and how they contribute to the final prediction. This could provide insights into the limitations of current LLMs in adopting multiple viewpoints. 2) Explore variations of the MPEP method, such as iterative refinement where the model critiques and improves its own multi-perspective analysis, or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground each perspective. 3) Investigate how MPEP performs on different types of tasks or queries, potentially uncovering specific domains where it excels or struggles. 4) Analyze the relationship between the number and diversity of perspectives and the quality of calibration, which could inform future research on optimal ensemble strategies for LLMs. 5) Compare MPEP against other recent calibration methods like temperature scaling or selective classification, potentially combining approaches for improved results."
