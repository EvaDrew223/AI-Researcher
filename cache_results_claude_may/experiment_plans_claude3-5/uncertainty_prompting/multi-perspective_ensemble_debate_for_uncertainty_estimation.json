        "Problem": "LLMs often provide point estimates of confidence without capturing the full range of uncertainty, especially for complex or controversial topics where multiple valid perspectives exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-model confidence estimation or simple ensemble methods that don't fully capture the nuances of multiple perspectives.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a debate between multiple expert personas within the LLM, we can explore a broader range of viewpoints and more accurately quantify uncertainty, especially for topics with legitimate disagreement among experts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Ensemble Debate for Uncertainty Estimation (MEDE). For a given query, MEDE first prompts the LLM to adopt several distinct expert personas relevant to the topic (e.g., historians from different schools of thought for a historical question). Each persona is then prompted to provide an answer and confidence estimate. Next, MEDE initiates a structured debate between these personas, with prompts designed to highlight areas of agreement and disagreement. The model, acting as each persona in turn, is encouraged to challenge others' viewpoints and defend its own. Throughout this process, personas can adjust their confidence levels based on the debate. Finally, MEDE prompts the model to synthesize the debate, providing a nuanced uncertainty estimate that captures the range of expert opinions and areas of consensus or disagreement.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MEDE on a curated set of complex, multi-faceted questions across various domains, with a focus on topics known to have some level of expert disagreement. Compare against standard confidence estimation techniques and simpler ensemble methods. Develop metrics to assess the quality of the simulated debate and the richness of the final uncertainty estimate. Conduct human expert evaluation to judge the realism of the simulated perspectives and the appropriateness of the final uncertainty quantification."

        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Ensemble Debate for Uncertainty Estimation (MEDE): Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide point estimates of confidence without capturing the full range of uncertainty, especially for complex or controversial topics where multiple valid perspectives exist. This can lead to overconfidence in areas of genuine disagreement among experts or underestimation of uncertainty in nuanced scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-model confidence estimation or simple ensemble methods that don't fully capture the nuances of multiple perspectives. By simulating a debate between multiple expert personas within the LLM, we can explore a broader range of viewpoints and more accurately quantify uncertainty, especially for topics with legitimate disagreement among experts. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to adopt different personas and engage in structured debate, potentially leading to more nuanced and calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Perspective Ensemble Debate for Uncertainty Estimation (MEDE). For a given query, MEDE follows these steps: 1) Persona Generation: Prompt the LLM to identify and adopt several distinct expert personas relevant to the topic. 2) Initial Responses: Each persona provides an answer and confidence estimate. 3) Structured Debate: Initiate a debate between these personas, with prompts designed to highlight areas of agreement and disagreement. Personas challenge others' viewpoints and defend their own. 4) Confidence Adjustment: Throughout the debate, personas can adjust their confidence levels based on the arguments presented. 5) Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize the debate, providing a nuanced uncertainty estimate that captures the range of expert opinions and areas of consensus or disagreement.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of 100-200 complex, multi-faceted questions across various domains (e.g., history, science, ethics, politics) known to have some level of expert disagreement. Sources can include academic debates, controversial Wikipedia topics, and expert surveys on areas of disagreement in various fields.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques: a) Direct prompting: Ask the LLM to provide an answer and confidence score. b) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses and use their variance as a measure of uncertainty. c) Calibrated probabilities: Use temperature scaling or Platt scaling to calibrate the model's probabilities.",
            "Step 3: MEDE Implementation": "Implement the MEDE method with the following sub-steps: a) Persona Generation: Prompt: 'Identify 3-5 distinct expert personas relevant to answering the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Initial Responses: For each persona, prompt: 'As [PERSONA], answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100): [QUESTION]' c) Structured Debate: Prompt: 'Initiate a debate between the personas. Each should challenge others' viewpoints and defend their own. After each round, personas can adjust their confidence scores.' d) Synthesis: Prompt: 'Synthesize the debate and provide a final uncertainty estimate that captures the range of expert opinions and areas of consensus or disagreement.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude 2 to assess generalizability across different LLMs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare predicted confidence with actual accuracy. b) Sharpness: Measure the concentration of the uncertainty estimates. c) Proper scoring rules: Use Brier score and log loss. d) Qualitative analysis: Human expert evaluation of debate quality and final uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Run all baseline methods and record their uncertainty estimates. b) Run MEDE and record the full debate process and final uncertainty estimate. c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare MEDE against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze how MEDE's performance varies across different types of questions and domains. c) Examine the impact of the number of personas and debate rounds on the quality of uncertainty estimates. d) Investigate cases where MEDE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

                "Baseline Method (Direct Prompting) Output": "The most likely cause of the Younger Dryas cooling event is the disruption of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation due to a massive influx of freshwater from the melting Laurentide Ice Sheet. Confidence score: 85",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single perspective with high confidence, failing to capture the ongoing scientific debate and uncertainty surrounding this topic."

                "Question": "What is the most likely cause of the Younger Dryas cooling event that occurred approximately 12,900 to 11,700 years ago?",
                "MEDE Step 1 (Persona Generation) Input": "Identify 3-5 distinct expert personas relevant to answering the following question: What is the most likely cause of the Younger Dryas cooling event that occurred approximately 12,900 to 11,700 years ago?",
                "MEDE Step 1 (Persona Generation) Output": "1. Paleoclimatologist specializing in abrupt climate changes\n2. Geologist focusing on impact events and their environmental effects\n3. Oceanographer studying thermohaline circulation\n4. Archaeologist specializing in early human societies and climate adaptation",
                "MEDE Step 2 (Initial Responses) Input": "As a [PERSONA], answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100): What is the most likely cause of the Younger Dryas cooling event that occurred approximately 12,900 to 11,700 years ago?",
                "MEDE Step 2 (Initial Responses) Output": "Paleoclimatologist: The most likely cause is the disruption of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation due to a massive influx of freshwater from the melting Laurentide Ice Sheet. Confidence score: 75\n\nGeologist: The Younger Dryas was likely triggered by a cosmic impact event, evidenced by the presence of nanodiamonds and other impact proxies in sediments dating to this period. Confidence score: 60\n\nOceanographer: The primary cause was likely a combination of factors, including changes in ocean circulation patterns and feedback loops involving sea ice and atmospheric circulation. Confidence score: 70\n\nArchaeologist: While I'm less certain about the initial trigger, the evidence suggests that the Younger Dryas had significant impacts on human societies, potentially influencing the transition to agriculture. The cause was likely a complex interplay of climatic factors. Confidence score: 50",
                "MEDE Step 3 (Structured Debate) Input": "Initiate a debate between the personas. Each should challenge others' viewpoints and defend their own. After each round, personas can adjust their confidence scores.",
                "MEDE Step 3 (Structured Debate) Output": "[Debate transcript with multiple rounds of discussion, challenges, and defenses of each perspective, including adjustments to confidence scores based on the arguments presented]",
                "MEDE Step 4 (Synthesis) Input": "Synthesize the debate and provide a final uncertainty estimate that captures the range of expert opinions and areas of consensus or disagreement.",
                "MEDE Step 4 (Synthesis) Output": "The debate reveals significant uncertainty about the primary cause of the Younger Dryas cooling event. While there is consensus that it was an abrupt climate change event with global impacts, experts disagree on the triggering mechanism. The thermohaline circulation disruption hypothesis has the most support (60-70% confidence), followed by the cosmic impact theory (40-50% confidence). There's agreement that multiple factors likely contributed, including ocean circulation changes and feedback loops. The uncertainty range is approximately 40-70%, reflecting the ongoing scientific debate and the complex nature of paleoclimate research. Further research, particularly in improving the resolution and accuracy of proxy records, is needed to narrow this uncertainty.",
                "Explanation": "MEDE successfully captures the range of expert opinions, areas of agreement and disagreement, and provides a nuanced uncertainty estimate that reflects the complexity of the scientific debate surrounding the Younger Dryas event."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MEDE doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why simulating expert debate doesn't improve uncertainty estimation. This could involve: 1) Analyzing the quality and diversity of generated personas to see if they truly represent distinct viewpoints. 2) Examining the debate transcripts to identify patterns in how the model agrees or disagrees with itself across personas. 3) Investigating whether the model is capable of genuinely updating its confidence based on debate arguments, or if it's simply restating initial beliefs. 4) Comparing MEDE's performance across different types of questions to identify where it's most/least effective. 5) Exploring how the number of personas and debate rounds affects the final uncertainty estimate. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of using LLMs for simulating expert disagreement and inform future research directions in improving uncertainty estimation in AI systems."
