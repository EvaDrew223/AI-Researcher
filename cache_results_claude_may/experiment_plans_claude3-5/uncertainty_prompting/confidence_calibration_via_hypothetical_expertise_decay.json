    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, particularly in specialized domains where their knowledge may be incomplete or outdated.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on static prompts or external knowledge bases, which may not capture the dynamic nature of expertise and knowledge decay.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts are aware that their knowledge decays over time and becomes less reliable. By simulating this process, we can potentially improve the model's ability to calibrate its confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Hypothetical Expertise Decay (HED) prompting. For a given query, we first prompt the model to respond as if it were an expert with perfect, up-to-date knowledge. We then iteratively prompt the model to respond as if its expertise is gradually decaying over time (e.g., 'Imagine your knowledge is 1 year old...', '5 years old...', etc.). By analyzing how the responses and expressed confidence change across these hypothetical time points, we can derive a more calibrated uncertainty estimate that accounts for potential knowledge decay.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate HED against baseline prompting methods on datasets covering rapidly evolving fields like technology and medicine. Use metrics such as calibration plots and Brier score to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Hypothetical Expertise Decay Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, particularly in specialized domains where their knowledge may be incomplete or outdated. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in rapidly evolving fields such as technology and medicine.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty calibration in LLMs often rely on static prompts or external knowledge bases, which may not capture the dynamic nature of expertise and knowledge decay. Human experts are aware that their knowledge becomes less reliable over time, especially in rapidly changing fields. By simulating this process of expertise decay, we can potentially improve the model's ability to calibrate its confidence and provide more accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Hypothetical Expertise Decay (HED) prompting, a novel method to improve uncertainty calibration in LLMs. The process involves the following steps: 1) For a given query, prompt the model to respond as if it were an expert with perfect, up-to-date knowledge. 2) Iteratively prompt the model to respond as if its expertise is gradually decaying over time (e.g., 'Imagine your knowledge is 1 year old...', '5 years old...', etc.). 3) Analyze how the responses and expressed confidence change across these hypothetical time points to derive a more calibrated uncertainty estimate that accounts for potential knowledge decay.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of questions from rapidly evolving fields such as technology and medicine. Use existing datasets like TechQA for technology-related questions and MedQA for medical questions. Ensure the dataset includes questions with known correct answers and timestamps to evaluate the model's performance over time.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Prompting": "Implement standard prompting methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting: Ask the question directly. b) Few-shot prompting: Provide a few examples before asking the question. c) Chain-of-thought prompting: Ask the model to think step-by-step.",
            "Step 3: Implement HED Prompting": "Develop the HED prompting method: a) Initial expert response: Prompt the model with 'As an expert with perfect, up-to-date knowledge, answer the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Time decay iterations: Prompt the model with 'Imagine your knowledge is [X] years old. Given this, how would you answer and what is your confidence in your answer? Question: [QUESTION]' Repeat this for X = 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. c) Confidence calibration: Analyze the changes in responses and confidence across time points to derive a final calibrated answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. b) Calibration plots: Plot the relationship between predicted probabilities and observed frequencies. c) Brier score: Compute the mean squared error of probabilistic predictions. d) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted probabilities and observed frequencies.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply all baseline prompting methods and record the answers and confidence scores. b) Apply the HED prompting method, recording answers and confidence scores for each time point. c) Derive the final calibrated answer and uncertainty estimate using the HED method. d) Compute all evaluation metrics for both baseline and HED methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of HED prompting against baselines using the evaluation metrics. b) Analyze how the model's responses and confidence change across different hypothetical time points. c) Investigate if there are patterns in how different types of questions or domains benefit from HED prompting. d) Examine cases where HED prompting significantly improves or worsens performance compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What is the current state-of-the-art accuracy for image classification on the ImageNet dataset?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The current state-of-the-art accuracy for image classification on the ImageNet dataset is approximately 90.2% top-1 accuracy, achieved by a model called ViT-G/14.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Expert Knowledge)": "As an expert with perfect, up-to-date knowledge, answer the following question: What is the current state-of-the-art accuracy for image classification on the ImageNet dataset?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Expert Knowledge)": "As an expert with perfect, up-to-date knowledge, I can confidently state that the current state-of-the-art accuracy for image classification on the ImageNet dataset is 92.7% top-1 accuracy, achieved by a model called CoAtNet-7 in 2022. I am 100% certain about this information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (5 Years Old Knowledge)": "Imagine your knowledge is 5 years old. Given this, how would you answer and what is your confidence in your answer? Question: What is the current state-of-the-art accuracy for image classification on the ImageNet dataset?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (5 Years Old Knowledge)": "Based on my knowledge from 5 years ago, the state-of-the-art accuracy for image classification on the ImageNet dataset was around 85% top-1 accuracy, achieved by models like ResNeXt and SENet. However, I'm only about 60% confident in this answer, as I know that significant advancements have likely been made in the past 5 years that I'm not aware of.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single answer with high confidence, which may be outdated or incorrect. The HED method, by contrast, provides different answers with varying levels of confidence based on hypothetical knowledge ages. This allows for a more nuanced and potentially more accurate final estimate of both the answer and the associated uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed HED prompting method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of how model responses change across different hypothetical time points. This could provide insights into how LLMs represent and reason about the concept of expertise decay. 2) Investigate whether the effectiveness of HED prompting varies across different domains or types of questions. This could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 3) Explore combining HED prompting with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or temperature scaling, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 4) Analyze cases where HED prompting performs poorly and use these insights to refine the method or develop alternative approaches. 5) If the time-based decay doesn't work well, we could experiment with other dimensions of hypothetical expertise variation, such as specialization level or access to different information sources."
