    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to update their confidence estimates appropriately when presented with new information, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in dynamic information environments.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods focus on static confidence estimation without considering the dynamic nature of information acquisition.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the Bayesian framework for updating beliefs in light of new evidence, we propose a method to guide language models in recursively updating their confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Bayesian Updating Prompting (RBUP), a technique that structures the interaction with the language model as a series of Bayesian updates. The initial prompt asks the model to provide an answer and a prior probability estimate for its correctness. Subsequent prompts present new pieces of information, asking the model to update its answer and confidence estimate, explaining its reasoning in terms of likelihood and posterior probability. The process continues iteratively, with each step potentially introducing conflicting or corroborating information. The final prompt asks the model to synthesize all updates into a final answer and confidence estimate, explicitly stating how different pieces of information influenced its belief.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate RBUP on tasks that involve evolving information, such as scientific claim evaluation or breaking news analysis. Compare against standard prompting and other dynamic confidence estimation methods. Assess the calibration of final confidence estimates and the rationality of intermediate updates using Bayesian optimality criteria."

        "Title": "Recursive Bayesian Updating Prompting: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to update their confidence estimates appropriately when presented with new information, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in dynamic information environments. This issue is particularly problematic in scenarios where information evolves rapidly, such as breaking news analysis or scientific claim evaluation.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in language models typically focus on static scenarios, failing to account for the dynamic nature of information acquisition. Our approach is inspired by the Bayesian framework for updating beliefs in light of new evidence, which provides a principled way to adjust confidence estimates as new information becomes available. By structuring the interaction with language models as a series of Bayesian updates, we aim to improve their ability to calibrate confidence in evolving information environments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Bayesian Updating Prompting (RBUP), a technique that guides language models through a series of Bayesian updates. The process begins with an initial prompt asking the model to provide an answer and a prior probability estimate for its correctness. Subsequent prompts present new pieces of information, prompting the model to update its answer and confidence estimate, explaining its reasoning in terms of likelihood and posterior probability. This process continues iteratively, with each step potentially introducing conflicting or corroborating information. The final prompt asks the model to synthesize all updates into a final answer and confidence estimate, explicitly stating how different pieces of information influenced its belief.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create or adapt datasets that involve evolving information scenarios. Focus on two main tasks: (1) Scientific claim evaluation using a curated dataset of scientific claims with sequential evidence presentation. (2) Breaking news analysis using a dataset of news events with updates over time. For each task, prepare 100-200 examples with 3-5 information updates per example.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Standard prompting: Ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate based on all available information presented at once. (2) Sequential prompting: Present information sequentially but without explicit Bayesian updating instructions.",
            "Step 3: RBUP Implementation": "Implement the RBUP method with the following steps: (a) Initial prompt: 'Given the following claim, provide an initial answer and your confidence (0-100%) in that answer. Claim: [INSERT CLAIM]' (b) Update prompt: 'New information: [INSERT NEW INFO]. Based on this, update your previous answer and confidence. Explain your reasoning in terms of how this new information affects the likelihood of your previous answer being correct.' (c) Final synthesis prompt: 'Considering all the information presented, provide your final answer and confidence. Explain how each piece of information influenced your belief.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task and each method (standard prompting, sequential prompting, and RBUP): (a) Run the model on all examples in the dataset. (b) For RBUP, perform 3-5 update iterations per example. (c) Record the final answer, confidence estimate, and intermediate reasoning steps.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the results using the following metrics: (1) Accuracy: Compare final answers to ground truth. (2) Calibration: Use Brier score to assess the calibration of confidence estimates. (3) Update consistency: Measure how consistently the model updates its beliefs in light of new evidence. (4) Reasoning quality: Manually assess a subset of examples to evaluate the quality of the model's reasoning process.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis: (1) Compare RBUP performance against baselines. (2) Analyze how confidence estimates change over update iterations. (3) Identify patterns in types of information that lead to significant updates. (4) Examine cases where RBUP performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Claim: Coffee consumption reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. Evidence: 1) A large-scale study found a 7% reduction in diabetes risk for each cup of coffee consumed daily. 2) Another study showed no significant effect of coffee on diabetes risk in people under 40. 3) A meta-analysis of 30 studies confirmed a protective effect of coffee against type 2 diabetes. 4) Researchers found that decaffeinated coffee also reduced diabetes risk, suggesting caffeine isn't the only factor. Based on this information, is the claim likely to be true? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "Answer: The claim that coffee consumption reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes is likely to be true. Confidence: 80%. This conclusion is based on the majority of evidence presented, particularly the large-scale study and the meta-analysis of 30 studies, which both support the protective effect of coffee against type 2 diabetes. The finding that decaffeinated coffee also shows this effect strengthens the claim. However, the study showing no significant effect in people under 40 introduces some uncertainty, which is why the confidence is not higher.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RBUP; Initial)": "Claim: Coffee consumption reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. Given this claim, provide an initial answer and your confidence (0-100%) in that answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RBUP; Initial)": "Initial Answer: Based solely on the claim without any supporting evidence, I would say it's possible that coffee consumption reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes, but I can't be certain. Confidence: 50%. This moderate confidence reflects the plausibility of the claim, as coffee has been associated with various health effects, but without specific evidence, I can't be more confident in either direction.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RBUP; Update 1)": "New information: A large-scale study found a 7% reduction in diabetes risk for each cup of coffee consumed daily. Based on this, update your previous answer and confidence. Explain your reasoning in terms of how this new information affects the likelihood of your previous answer being correct.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RBUP; Update 1)": "Updated Answer: Coffee consumption likely reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. Confidence: 70%. Reasoning: This new information significantly increases the likelihood that my previous answer is correct. The large-scale study provides strong evidence supporting the claim, showing a dose-dependent relationship between coffee consumption and reduced diabetes risk. The 7% reduction per cup is a substantial effect. However, I'm not fully confident yet because one study, despite being large-scale, isn't conclusive on its own. We'd need to consider factors like study design, replication, and potential confounding variables.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RBUP; Final Synthesis)": "(After presenting all pieces of evidence) Considering all the information presented, provide your final answer and confidence. Explain how each piece of information influenced your belief.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RBUP; Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Coffee consumption very likely reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. Confidence: 85%. Explanation: Each piece of information influenced my belief as follows: 1) The large-scale study showing a 7% risk reduction per cup provided a strong initial evidence base, significantly increasing confidence. 2) The study showing no effect in people under 40 slightly decreased confidence, suggesting the effect might not be universal across age groups. 3) The meta-analysis of 30 studies substantially boosted confidence, as it provides a comprehensive view of the existing research and confirms the protective effect. 4) The finding about decaffeinated coffee further increased confidence by suggesting the effect isn't solely due to caffeine, implying a more robust relationship between coffee and diabetes risk. The combination of large-scale individual studies, a meta-analysis, and mechanistic insights from the decaf study creates a compelling body of evidence. The slight uncertainty reflected in the 85% confidence (rather than higher) is due to the age-specific null finding and the general principle that further research could always reveal new insights.",
            "explanation": "RBUP allows for a more nuanced and dynamic confidence estimation process. It starts with a moderate prior based on limited information, then systematically updates this belief as new evidence is presented. This process mimics how scientific consensus is built, allowing for more transparent reasoning and better-calibrated final confidence estimates compared to standard prompting, which might be overly influenced by the order or framing of information presented all at once."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If RBUP doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the model's reasoning process at each update step to identify patterns in how it incorporates new information. This could provide insights into the model's internal 'reasoning' mechanisms. 2) Experiment with variations of RBUP, such as explicitly asking the model to assign weights to different pieces of information, or introducing a 'devil's advocate' step where the model is prompted to argue against its current belief. 3) Investigate how RBUP performs on different types of tasks or domains, which could reveal task-specific strengths or weaknesses of the method. 4) Analyze cases where RBUP performs poorly to identify potential improvements to the prompting strategy. 5) Compare RBUP's performance across different model sizes or architectures to understand how model capacity affects the ability to perform recursive Bayesian updating. These alternative directions could turn the project into an insightful analysis of LLM reasoning processes and confidence calibration mechanisms, even if the original hypothesis isn't fully supported."
