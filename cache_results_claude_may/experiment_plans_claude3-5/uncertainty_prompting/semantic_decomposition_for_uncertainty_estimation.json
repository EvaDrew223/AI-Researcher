        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates for complex queries that involve multiple concepts or reasoning steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches treat queries as atomic units when estimating confidence, missing the nuanced uncertainties in different components of the answer.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down complex queries into semantic components and estimating uncertainty for each part separately, we can build up a more accurate and interpretable overall confidence assessment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting process for semantic decomposition and uncertainty estimation. First, we prompt the LLM to break down the query into its core semantic components and required reasoning steps. Then, for each component, we ask the model to provide a confidence estimate and explanation. We guide the model to consider potential interactions and dependencies between components. Finally, we prompt the model to synthesize these component-level uncertainties into an overall confidence estimate, explaining how uncertainty in each part contributes to the whole. This process allows for fine-grained uncertainty estimation and provides an interpretable breakdown of the model's confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on complex multi-step reasoning tasks and compare to baseline confidence estimation techniques. Assess both the overall calibration of confidence scores and the usefulness of the semantic decomposition for explaining model uncertainty to users."

        "Title": "Semantic Decomposition and Uncertainty Estimation for Improved Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates for complex queries that involve multiple concepts or reasoning steps. This leads to unreliable or overconfident responses in scenarios where the model's knowledge is incomplete or uncertain.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically treat queries as atomic units when estimating confidence, missing the nuanced uncertainties in different components of the answer. By breaking down complex queries into semantic components and estimating uncertainty for each part separately, we can build up a more accurate and interpretable overall confidence assessment. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to perform meta-reasoning about its own knowledge and uncertainties, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates without requiring extensive retraining or external knowledge bases.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting process for semantic decomposition and uncertainty estimation:\n1. Query Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the complex query into its core semantic components and required reasoning steps.\n2. Component-wise Uncertainty Estimation: For each component, ask the model to provide a confidence estimate and explanation, considering potential interactions and dependencies between components.\n3. Uncertainty Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize these component-level uncertainties into an overall confidence estimate, explaining how uncertainty in each part contributes to the whole.\n4. Final Response Generation: Based on the decomposition and uncertainty analysis, generate a final response that incorporates the confidence assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets to evaluate our method:\n1. TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to test the truthfulness and uncertainty of language models.\n2. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A dataset covering 57 tasks across diverse domains, suitable for testing complex reasoning.\n3. HotpotQA: A dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning, ideal for testing our decomposition approach.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score.\n2. Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to calibrate confidence.\n3. Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Implement Proposed Method": "1. Query Decomposition Prompt: 'Break down the following question into its core components and reasoning steps: [QUESTION]'\n2. Component-wise Uncertainty Prompt: 'For each component identified, provide a confidence estimate (0-100%) and explain your reasoning: [COMPONENTS]'\n3. Uncertainty Synthesis Prompt: 'Based on the component-level uncertainties, provide an overall confidence estimate for the entire question. Explain how each component's uncertainty contributes to the whole.'\n4. Final Response Generation Prompt: 'Given the decomposition and uncertainty analysis, provide a final answer to the original question, incorporating your confidence assessment.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1. Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy.\n2. Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n3. ECE (Expected Calibration Error): Measure the difference between confidence and accuracy in bins.\n4. Answer accuracy: Evaluate the correctness of the final answers.\n5. Human evaluation: Assess the interpretability and usefulness of the uncertainty breakdowns.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "1. For each dataset, run the baselines and our proposed method on a subset of 1000 questions.\n2. Collect model outputs, including decompositions, component-wise uncertainties, synthesized uncertainties, and final answers.\n3. Calculate evaluation metrics for each method.\n4. Perform statistical significance tests to compare our method against baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare calibration performance across methods and datasets.\n2. Analyze patterns in semantic decompositions and how they relate to overall uncertainty.\n3. Investigate cases where our method significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.\n4. Assess the coherence and usefulness of the uncertainty explanations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who would win in a fight between Superman and Goku?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on my knowledge of both characters, Superman would likely win in a fight against Goku. Superman has nearly limitless strength, invulnerability, and a wide range of powers including heat vision and freeze breath. Goku, while incredibly powerful, has limits to his strength and can be injured. However, this is a highly debated topic among fans and there's no definitive answer. Confidence: 70%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Decomposition)": "Break down the following question into its core components and reasoning steps: Who would win in a fight between Superman and Goku?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. Superman's abilities and strengths\n2. Goku's abilities and strengths\n3. Comparison of their power levels\n4. Factors that could influence the outcome (e.g., environment, specific versions of characters)\n5. Limitations of comparing fictional characters from different universes",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Component-wise Uncertainty)": "For each component identified, provide a confidence estimate (0-100%) and explain your reasoning:\n1. Superman's abilities and strengths\n2. Goku's abilities and strengths\n3. Comparison of their power levels\n4. Factors that could influence the outcome\n5. Limitations of comparing fictional characters from different universes",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Component-wise Uncertainty)": "1. Superman's abilities (90% confidence): High confidence due to consistent portrayal in comics and movies. Main powers include super strength, flight, heat vision, and invulnerability.\n2. Goku's abilities (85% confidence): High confidence based on Dragon Ball series. Powers include super strength, energy blasts, and transformations that increase power.\n3. Power level comparison (60% confidence): Lower confidence due to difficulties in directly comparing characters from different fictional universes. Both have shown planet-destroying capabilities.\n4. Influencing factors (70% confidence): Moderate confidence. Factors like specific versions of characters (e.g., different Superman iterations) and battle environment could significantly affect the outcome.\n5. Limitations of cross-universe comparisons (95% confidence): Very high confidence that this is a fundamental limitation. Characters are designed by different creators with different rules and power scales.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the component-level uncertainties, provide an overall confidence estimate for the entire question. Explain how each component's uncertainty contributes to the whole.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Overall confidence estimate: 55%\n\nExplanation: While we have high confidence in our understanding of each character's abilities (90% for Superman, 85% for Goku), the overall confidence is significantly lowered by several factors. The difficulty in directly comparing power levels across different fictional universes (60% confidence) introduces substantial uncertainty. The potential influence of specific factors like character versions and battle conditions (70% confidence) further complicates the prediction. Most importantly, the fundamental limitation of comparing characters from different fictional universes (95% confidence) reminds us that any answer is speculative at best. The high confidence in this limitation paradoxically lowers our overall confidence in providing a definitive answer. Therefore, while we can make an educated guess based on known abilities, the overall confidence in predicting a winner is relatively low at 55%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Response)": "Given the decomposition and uncertainty analysis, provide a final answer to the original question 'Who would win in a fight between Superman and Goku?', incorporating your confidence assessment.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Response)": "Based on our analysis, it's difficult to definitively state who would win in a fight between Superman and Goku. Both characters possess extraordinary abilities and have demonstrated planet-destroying levels of power. Superman's near-invulnerability and diverse range of powers (like heat vision and freeze breath) give him certain advantages. Goku's ability to continuously increase his power through transformations and his mastery of martial arts techniques provide him with unique strengths.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that comparing characters from different fictional universes introduces significant uncertainty. The outcome could vary greatly depending on which versions of the characters are considered and the specific conditions of the hypothetical battle.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate a 55% confidence level in any prediction. If pressed to make a choice, I would give a slight edge to Superman due to his consistent portrayal of near-limitless power and invulnerability. However, this is far from certain, and a strong case could be made for either character.\n\nUltimately, this question is a topic of ongoing debate among fans, and there is no definitive, factual answer. The uncertainty in this prediction highlights the speculative nature of cross-universe character comparisons.",
            "explanation": "The proposed method provides a more nuanced and transparent assessment of the question. By breaking down the query into components, we can see where the uncertainties lie (e.g., in comparing power levels across universes). The final response incorporates these uncertainties, providing a more calibrated and justified confidence level compared to the baseline, which gave a somewhat arbitrary 70% confidence without explaining the reasoning behind it."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed semantic decomposition method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why the decomposition fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of LLMs in meta-reasoning tasks. This could involve categorizing the types of questions where decomposition helps or hinders, potentially leading to a taxonomy of query types and their amenability to this approach. Second, we could explore combining our method with other techniques, such as ensemble methods or external knowledge retrieval, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could shift focus to use the semantic decompositions as a tool for explaining model uncertainty to users, even if it doesn't improve calibration. This could involve a user study to assess whether the decomposed explanations help users better understand and appropriately trust or distrust model outputs in different scenarios."
