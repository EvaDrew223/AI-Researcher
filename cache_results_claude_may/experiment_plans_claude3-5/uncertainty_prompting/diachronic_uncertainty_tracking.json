        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to account for how their uncertainty about facts or concepts may change over time, leading to miscalibrated confidence for time-sensitive queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically treat model knowledge as static and do not explicitly consider the temporal dimension of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting models to reason about how their knowledge and uncertainty evolve over time, we can obtain more accurately calibrated confidence estimates for time-sensitive queries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Diachronic Uncertainty Tracking (DUT), a prompting technique that guides the model to reason about the temporal dynamics of its knowledge and uncertainty. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Identify time-sensitive elements in the query, 2) Estimate its knowledge state and uncertainty at multiple time points (e.g., at the time of training, at present, and in the future), 3) Reason about factors that might cause its uncertainty to increase or decrease over time, 4) Provide a confidence score that accounts for these temporal dynamics. For example, a prompt might include: 'Identify any time-sensitive elements in this query. Estimate your knowledge and uncertainty about these elements at the time of your training, at present, and 5 years in the future. Explain factors that might change your uncertainty over time. Provide a final confidence score (0-100%) that accounts for these temporal dynamics.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate DUT against standard confidence estimation techniques on a curated dataset of time-sensitive queries spanning various domains (e.g., current events, technology trends, scientific knowledge). Assess both the calibration of confidence scores and the quality of temporal reasoning provided."

        "Title": "Diachronic Uncertainty Tracking: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models for Time-Sensitive Queries",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for how their uncertainty about facts or concepts may change over time, leading to miscalibrated confidence for time-sensitive queries. This issue can result in outdated or inaccurate information being presented with unwarranted certainty, potentially misleading users in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically treat model knowledge as static and do not explicitly consider the temporal dimension of uncertainty. By prompting models to reason about how their knowledge and uncertainty evolve over time, we can obtain more accurately calibrated confidence estimates for time-sensitive queries. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to improve its performance without requiring extensive retraining or external knowledge bases.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Diachronic Uncertainty Tracking (DUT), a prompting technique that guides the model to reason about the temporal dynamics of its knowledge and uncertainty. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Identify time-sensitive elements in the query, 2) Estimate its knowledge state and uncertainty at multiple time points (e.g., at the time of training, at present, and in the future), 3) Reason about factors that might cause its uncertainty to increase or decrease over time, 4) Provide a confidence score that accounts for these temporal dynamics. The DUT prompt structure is as follows: 'Identify any time-sensitive elements in this query. Estimate your knowledge and uncertainty about these elements at the time of your training, at present, and 5 years in the future. Explain factors that might change your uncertainty over time. Provide a final confidence score (0-100%) that accounts for these temporal dynamics.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a curated dataset of time-sensitive queries spanning various domains (e.g., current events, technology trends, scientific knowledge). Include a mix of queries with different temporal characteristics (e.g., rapidly changing facts, slowly evolving concepts, future predictions). Annotate each query with a ground truth answer and the correct time frame for the answer.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: a) Direct prompting: Ask the model to answer the query and provide a confidence score. b) Static CoT: Use chain-of-thought prompting to generate reasoning steps before providing an answer and confidence score.",
            "Step 3: DUT Implementation": "Implement the Diachronic Uncertainty Tracking method using the proposed prompt structure. Ensure that the prompt is consistent across all queries in the dataset.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo as the primary models for evaluation. If resources allow, also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each query in the dataset: a) Apply the baseline methods and record the answer and confidence score. b) Apply the DUT method and record the full response, including the temporal reasoning and final confidence score. c) Store all outputs for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence scores with its actual accuracy. b) Temporal reasoning quality: Manually assess a subset of responses for the quality and relevance of temporal reasoning. c) Answer accuracy: Compare the model's answers to the ground truth. d) Confidence distribution: Analyze the distribution of confidence scores across different query types and time frames.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the results: a) Compare the performance of DUT against the baselines across all metrics. b) Investigate how DUT affects confidence calibration for different types of time-sensitive queries. c) Analyze cases where DUT significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines. d) Examine the relationship between the quality of temporal reasoning and the accuracy of confidence estimates.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of the DUT prompt: a) Remove the explicit time points (training, present, future) and compare performance. b) Omit the request for factors affecting uncertainty over time. c) Vary the number of time points considered (e.g., 2 vs. 3 vs. 5 time points).",
            "Step 9: Generalization Tests": "Test the generalization of DUT on a separate set of queries from domains not included in the original dataset to assess its robustness across different types of time-sensitive information."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Who is the current President of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The current President of France is Emmanuel Macron. Confidence score: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUT)": "Who is the current President of France? Identify any time-sensitive elements in this query. Estimate your knowledge and uncertainty about these elements at the time of your training, at present, and 5 years in the future. Explain factors that might change your uncertainty over time. Provide a final confidence score (0-100%) that accounts for these temporal dynamics.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUT)": "Time-sensitive element: The current President of France.\n\nKnowledge and uncertainty estimates:\n1. At training time: Emmanuel Macron was President. Uncertainty low due to recent election.\n2. At present: Emmanuel Macron is likely still President, but uncertainty increased slightly due to potential political changes.\n3. 5 years in future: High uncertainty as a new election will have occurred.\n\nFactors affecting uncertainty:\n1. Regular presidential elections in France (every 5 years)\n2. Potential for political upheaval or unexpected events\n3. The dynamic nature of global politics\n\nReasoning: Given that my training data is not completely up-to-date, there's a small chance that a change in presidency has occurred that I'm unaware of. However, based on the typical length of presidential terms and the relative stability of French politics, it's highly likely that Emmanuel Macron is still the current President.\n\nFinal answer: The current President of France is Emmanuel Macron.\n\nConfidence score: 85%\n\nThis score reflects high confidence in the answer based on recent knowledge, but acknowledges the possibility of changes since my training data was last updated.",
            "explanation": "The DUT method provides a more nuanced and temporally-aware confidence estimate. It explicitly considers the time-sensitive nature of the query and factors that could affect the model's certainty over time, resulting in a more calibrated confidence score compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DUT method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the temporal reasoning generated by the model to understand its limitations and potential biases. This could yield insights into how LLMs conceptualize time and uncertainty, potentially leading to a paper on the cognitive aspects of AI reasoning. 2) Explore hybrid approaches that combine DUT with external knowledge sources or fact-checking mechanisms. This could involve using the temporal reasoning as a guide for targeted information retrieval, potentially improving both accuracy and calibration. 3) Investigate whether the DUT method, while not improving overall calibration, performs better on specific types of queries or time frames. This could lead to the development of a more specialized tool for certain domains or use cases where temporal dynamics are particularly crucial."
