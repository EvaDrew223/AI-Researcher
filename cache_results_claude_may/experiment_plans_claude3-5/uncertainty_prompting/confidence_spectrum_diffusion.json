    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often produce binary or coarse-grained confidence scores, failing to capture the nuanced spectrum of uncertainty across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-point estimates or simple calibration techniques that don't fully capture the multidimensional nature of uncertainty in complex language tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by diffusion models in image generation, we posit that uncertainty in language can be modeled as a gradual process of refinement from a high-entropy state to a low-entropy state.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Diffusion (CSD), a novel prompting technique that iteratively refines a response while tracking uncertainty across multiple dimensions. Starting with a high-entropy prompt, we guide the model through a series of denoising steps, each time asking it to refine its response and provide confidence estimates across various aspects (e.g., factual accuracy, relevance, coherence). By analyzing the trajectory of these multi-dimensional confidence scores through the diffusion process, we can obtain a rich, granular representation of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CSD against standard uncertainty estimation techniques on a range of tasks including open-ended question answering, summarization, and creative writing. We'll measure performance using metrics such as calibration error, uncertainty decomposition accuracy, and correlation with human judgments of confidence across different aspects of the responses."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Diffusion: A Novel Prompting Method for Granular Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often produce binary or coarse-grained confidence scores, failing to capture the nuanced spectrum of uncertainty across different aspects of a response. This limitation hinders the practical application of LLMs in critical domains where fine-grained uncertainty quantification is crucial for decision-making and risk assessment.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-point estimates or simple calibration techniques that don't fully capture the multidimensional nature of uncertainty in complex language tasks. Inspired by diffusion models in image generation, we posit that uncertainty in language can be modeled as a gradual process of refinement from a high-entropy state to a low-entropy state. This approach allows for a more granular and multidimensional representation of uncertainty, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Diffusion (CSD), a novel prompting technique that iteratively refines a response while tracking uncertainty across multiple dimensions. The method consists of the following steps:\n1. Initialize with a high-entropy prompt\n2. Perform a series of denoising steps, each time:\n   a. Refine the response\n   b. Provide confidence estimates across various aspects (e.g., factual accuracy, relevance, coherence)\n3. Analyze the trajectory of multi-dimensional confidence scores through the diffusion process\n4. Generate a final response along with a rich, granular representation of the model's uncertainty landscape",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method:\n1. TruthfulQA: For open-ended question answering\n2. XSum: For summarization tasks\n3. WritingPrompts: For creative writing tasks",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation methods:\n1. Temperature scaling\n2. Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation\n3. Monte Carlo Dropout",
            "Step 3: CSD Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Spectrum Diffusion method:\n1. Design the high-entropy initial prompt\n2. Implement the iterative denoising process\n3. Define the multi-dimensional confidence aspects\n4. Develop the confidence score trajectory analysis",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model:\n1. Run baseline methods\n2. Run CSD method with varying numbers of diffusion steps (e.g., 5, 10, 20)\n3. Collect responses and confidence scores",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics:\n1. Calibration error\n2. Uncertainty decomposition accuracy\n3. Correlation with human judgments of confidence\n4. Task-specific metrics (e.g., ROUGE for summarization)",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare CSD performance against baselines\n2. Analyze the impact of diffusion steps on uncertainty estimation\n3. Examine the trajectory of confidence scores across different aspects\n4. Investigate the relationship between uncertainty estimates and task performance"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output (Temperature Scaling)": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "Explanation": "Temperature scaling provides a single confidence score, which doesn't capture the nuanced uncertainty across different aspects of the response."
            },
            "CSD Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "Initial high-entropy prompt: 'The capital of France is a city in Europe.'\nStep 1: 'The capital of France is likely Paris, a major city in Europe.' (Factual accuracy: 0.7, Relevance: 0.9, Coherence: 0.8)\nStep 2: 'The capital of France is Paris, located in north-central France.' (Factual accuracy: 0.9, Relevance: 0.95, Coherence: 0.9)\nStep 3: 'The capital of France is Paris, a global center for art, fashion, and culture.' (Factual accuracy: 0.95, Relevance: 0.9, Coherence: 0.95)\nFinal response: 'The capital of France is Paris, a major European city and global center known for its art, fashion, and culture, located in north-central France.' (Factual accuracy: 0.98, Relevance: 0.97, Coherence: 0.99)",
                "Explanation": "CSD provides a trajectory of confidence scores across multiple dimensions, offering a more granular and informative uncertainty quantification."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the confidence score trajectories to gain insights into how uncertainty evolves during the diffusion process. This could lead to a better understanding of LLM reasoning and potentially inform new uncertainty estimation techniques. Second, we could investigate the relationship between different aspects of confidence (e.g., factual accuracy, relevance, coherence) and how they interact. This might reveal interesting patterns in how LLMs assess their own uncertainty across different dimensions. Finally, we could explore combining CSD with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods."
