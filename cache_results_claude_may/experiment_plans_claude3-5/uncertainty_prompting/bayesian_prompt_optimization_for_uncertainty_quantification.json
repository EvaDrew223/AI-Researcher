    "idea_name": "Bayesian Prompt Optimization for Uncertainty Quantification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often rely on fixed prompting strategies, which may not adapt well to different types of queries or model behaviors.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use predefined prompts or simple heuristics for eliciting uncertainty estimates from LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "By treating prompt design as a Bayesian optimization problem, we can dynamically adapt the prompting strategy to maximize the informativeness and accuracy of uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Bayesian Prompt Optimization (BPO), a method that treats the prompt space as a continuous optimization landscape. Starting with a pool of seed prompts, BPO iteratively refines the prompting strategy. In each iteration, it selects a set of prompts, elicits responses and confidence estimates from the LLM, and updates a Gaussian Process model of the prompt-performance landscape. This model is used to propose new candidate prompts that are likely to improve uncertainty quantification. The method balances exploration of the prompt space with exploitation of promising regions, adapting the strategy to the specific query and model behavior.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare BPO against fixed prompting strategies and other adaptive methods on a diverse set of tasks, including open-ended generation and structured prediction. Evaluate both the quality of uncertainty estimates and the efficiency of the optimization process in terms of the number of queries required to achieve well-calibrated estimates."

        "Title": "Bayesian Prompt Optimization for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on fixed prompting strategies, which may not adapt well to different types of queries or model behaviors. This leads to suboptimal uncertainty estimates and poor calibration of model confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use predefined prompts or simple heuristics for eliciting uncertainty estimates from LLMs. These methods lack the flexibility to adapt to diverse query types and model behaviors. By treating prompt design as a Bayesian optimization problem, we can dynamically adapt the prompting strategy to maximize the informativeness and accuracy of uncertainty estimates. This approach allows us to leverage the model's own capabilities to refine the prompting strategy, potentially leading to more accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates across a wide range of tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Bayesian Prompt Optimization (BPO), a method that treats the prompt space as a continuous optimization landscape. The process works as follows: 1) Initialize with a pool of seed prompts. 2) In each iteration, select a set of prompts based on an acquisition function. 3) Elicit responses and confidence estimates from the LLM using these prompts. 4) Update a Gaussian Process model of the prompt-performance landscape based on the results. 5) Use this model to propose new candidate prompts that are likely to improve uncertainty quantification. 6) Repeat steps 2-5 for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence. This method balances exploration of the prompt space with exploitation of promising regions, adapting the strategy to the specific query and model behavior.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare datasets for open-ended generation (e.g., story continuation) and structured prediction (e.g., multiple-choice question answering). Use existing datasets like WritingPrompts for open-ended tasks and MMLU for structured tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement fixed prompting strategies as baselines: (a) Direct prompting without uncertainty elicitation, (b) Simple uncertainty prompting (e.g., 'How confident are you about this answer?'), (c) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using multiple prompts.",
            "Step 3: BPO Implementation": "Implement the Bayesian Prompt Optimization method: (a) Define a parametric space for prompts (e.g., using sentence embeddings), (b) Implement a Gaussian Process model for the prompt-performance landscape, (c) Implement acquisition functions (e.g., Expected Improvement, Upper Confidence Bound), (d) Develop a prompt generator that can create new prompts based on the GP model's predictions.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement evaluation metrics: (a) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), (b) Sharpness of uncertainty estimates, (c) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., perplexity for open-ended generation, accuracy for structured prediction).",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task and dataset: (a) Run baseline methods and record results, (b) Run BPO for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 50), recording intermediate results at each iteration, (c) Compare final BPO results with baselines.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Analyze results: (a) Compare performance across methods, (b) Analyze the evolution of prompts over BPO iterations, (c) Investigate the relationship between prompt characteristics and uncertainty estimation quality."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. How confident are you about this answer?",
                "Output": "I am very confident (95%) that the capital of France is Paris.",
                "Explanation": "This baseline method directly asks for confidence, but the model might be overconfident or poorly calibrated."
            },
            "BPO Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. On a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 means completely uncertain and 100 means absolutely certain, how would you rate your confidence in this answer? Please provide your reasoning for this confidence rating.",
                "Output": "Confidence rating: 98/100\nReasoning: I'm highly confident in this answer for several reasons:\n1. Paris being the capital of France is a widely known and established fact.\n2. It has been the capital for centuries, since 987 AD.\n3. It's the seat of the French government and the official residence of the President of France.\n4. This information is consistently taught in schools and appears in numerous reliable sources.\n5. I've never encountered any credible alternative claims about France's capital.\nHowever, I'm not rating it 100/100 because there's always a tiny possibility of an extremely recent, unprecedented change that I'm not aware of, or some extremely unlikely scenario where my fundamental knowledge is incorrect.",
                "Explanation": "The BPO-generated prompt elicits a more nuanced confidence estimate with reasoning, allowing for better calibration and uncertainty quantification."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed BPO method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt landscape, examining how different prompt characteristics correlate with uncertainty estimation quality. This could provide insights into why certain prompts work better than others and potentially inform heuristic-based approaches. Second, we could investigate the failure modes of BPO, such as local optima or inadequate exploration, and propose modifications to the algorithm (e.g., different acquisition functions, multi-objective optimization). Third, we could expand the study to compare BPO with other adaptive methods, such as active learning or reinforcement learning approaches for prompt optimization. Finally, we could shift focus to analyzing how different types of tasks and queries affect the optimal prompting strategy for uncertainty quantification, potentially leading to a taxonomy of uncertainty elicitation strategies for different LLM applications."
