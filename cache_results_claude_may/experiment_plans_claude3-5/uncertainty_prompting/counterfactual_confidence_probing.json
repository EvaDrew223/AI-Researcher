        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas where they lack expertise or when presented with ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or uncertainty sampling, which may not effectively probe the model's knowledge boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by counterfactual thinking in human reasoning, we propose that exploring slight variations of the input query can reveal the model's true confidence and knowledge boundaries more effectively than direct estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Confidence Probing (CCP), a novel prompting technique. Given an initial query, CCP generates a set of counterfactual queries by slightly modifying key elements (e.g., changing entities, time periods, or relationships). The LLM is then prompted to answer these counterfactual queries and compare its confidence across the set. By analyzing the pattern of confidence changes, CCP constructs a 'confidence landscape' around the original query. This landscape is then used to calibrate the final confidence estimate for the original query, taking into account the model's sensitivity to small changes in the input.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CCP against standard confidence estimation techniques on a range of tasks, including factual QA and commonsense reasoning. We'll measure improvements in calibration and assess the method's ability to detect out-of-distribution queries. Additionally, we'll conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated confidence landscapes to gain insights into the model's knowledge boundaries."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Probing: Calibrating LLM Uncertainty through Comparative Query Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas where they lack expertise or when presented with ambiguous queries. This overconfidence can result in the propagation of misinformation and unreliable decision-making in critical applications. Existing methods for confidence estimation and uncertainty quantification in LLMs are limited in their ability to effectively probe the model's true knowledge boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to LLM confidence estimation typically rely on direct confidence scoring or uncertainty sampling, which may not adequately capture the nuances of the model's knowledge landscape. Inspired by counterfactual thinking in human reasoning, we propose that exploring slight variations of the input query can reveal the model's true confidence and knowledge boundaries more effectively than direct estimation. By analyzing how the model's responses change with small perturbations to the input, we can construct a more accurate representation of its confidence landscape and calibrate its uncertainty estimates accordingly.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Confidence Probing (CCP), a novel prompting technique for calibrating LLM confidence. The CCP method consists of the following steps: 1) Given an initial query, generate a set of counterfactual queries by slightly modifying key elements (e.g., changing entities, time periods, or relationships). 2) Prompt the LLM to answer these counterfactual queries and provide confidence scores for each answer. 3) Analyze the pattern of confidence changes across the set of counterfactual queries to construct a 'confidence landscape' around the original query. 4) Use this landscape to calibrate the final confidence estimate for the original query, taking into account the model's sensitivity to small changes in the input.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets for evaluation: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) CSQA for commonsense reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of domains and difficulty levels, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of CCP across different types of queries.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods for confidence estimation: a) Direct confidence scoring: Prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and use the variance of multiple forward passes as an uncertainty estimate. c) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use an ensemble of different LLM checkpoints and measure disagreement as uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CCP Implementation": "Implement the Counterfactual Confidence Probing method: a) Develop a query perturbation module that generates counterfactual queries by modifying entities, relationships, or temporal aspects of the original query. b) Create a prompting template that asks the LLM to answer the original and counterfactual queries, providing confidence scores for each. c) Implement a confidence landscape analysis module that aggregates the confidence scores from counterfactual queries and calibrates the final confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Experimental Setup": "For each dataset and method (baselines and CCP): a) Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 as the target LLMs. b) Process each query through the respective confidence estimation method. c) Record the model's answers, raw confidence scores, and calibrated confidence scores (for CCP).",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Assess the performance of CCP against baselines using the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) AUC-ROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores. d) Spearman's rank correlation: Measure the correlation between confidence scores and answer correctness.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: a) Compare CCP performance against baselines across different question types and difficulty levels. b) Analyze the generated confidence landscapes to gain insights into the model's knowledge boundaries. c) Investigate cases where CCP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. d) Examine the impact of the number and type of counterfactual queries on CCP performance.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components: a) Vary the number of counterfactual queries generated. b) Compare different strategies for generating counterfactual queries (e.g., entity substitution vs. relationship modification). c) Explore alternative methods for aggregating confidence scores from counterfactual queries."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 0 means completely uncertain and 1 means absolutely certain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nConfidence Score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 1: Generate Counterfactual Queries)": "Original Question: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nGenerate 3 counterfactual queries by slightly modifying the original question:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 1: Generate Counterfactual Queries)": "1. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the first person to orbit the moon?\n3. Who was the first American to walk in space?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 2: Answer Queries with Confidence Scores)": "Please answer each of the following questions and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each answer:\n1. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n3. Who was the first person to orbit the moon?\n4. Who was the first American to walk in space?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 2: Answer Queries with Confidence Scores)": "1. Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 0.95\n2. Buzz Aldrin was the second person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 0.9\n3. Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders were the first people to orbit the moon (Apollo 8 mission). Confidence: 0.85\n4. Ed White was the first American to walk in space. Confidence: 0.8",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 3: Calibrate Confidence)": "Based on the confidence scores for the original and counterfactual queries, provide a calibrated confidence score for the answer to the original question: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 3: Calibrate Confidence)": "Calibrated Confidence Score: 0.92\nExplanation: The high confidence (0.95) in the original answer is supported by strong confidence in closely related facts (0.9 for the second person on the moon). However, the slightly lower confidence in more distantly related space facts (0.85 and 0.8) suggests some uncertainty in the broader context of space exploration history. Therefore, a slightly reduced calibrated confidence of 0.92 reflects a more nuanced assessment of the model's knowledge boundaries in this domain.",
            "explanation": "CCP improves confidence calibration by considering the model's performance on related queries. The slight reduction in confidence from 0.95 to 0.92 reflects a more realistic assessment of the model's knowledge, accounting for potential uncertainties in the broader context of space exploration history."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCP method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactual queries to understand why they may not be effectively probing the model's knowledge boundaries. This could lead to insights on improving query generation strategies. 2) Investigate whether CCP performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could inform more targeted applications of the method. 3) Explore combining CCP with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration via temperature scaling, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. 4) Analyze cases where CCP performs poorly to identify patterns or characteristics that make certain queries challenging for this method. This could lead to the development of a taxonomy of question types and their suitability for different confidence estimation techniques. 5) If the counterfactual queries themselves prove valuable, we could refocus the project on using these queries to augment training data or as a method for probing and analyzing LLM behavior, rather than strictly for confidence calibration."
