        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often produce single scalar values, which may not capture the full range and nuance of model uncertainty across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like entropy of output distributions or calibrated confidence scores.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by spectrum analysis in physics, we can potentially represent uncertainty as a multi-dimensional spectrum across different semantic aspects of a response, providing a richer and more informative uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Spectrum Visualization Prompting (USVP), which involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) Decompose the response into key semantic aspects. 2) For each aspect, prompt the model to generate a visual representation of its uncertainty as a spectrum (e.g. a color gradient from red to green). 3) Combine these spectra into a composite visualization. 4) Prompt the model to interpret and explain the visualization, providing a detailed breakdown of its uncertainty across different dimensions of the response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare USVP against baseline scalar uncertainty methods on tasks like open-ended question answering and text summarization, evaluating both quantitative metrics (e.g. correlation with human judgments) and qualitative assessments of the richness and interpretability of the uncertainty representations."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Spectrum Visualization Prompting: A Multi-Dimensional Approach to Quantifying Model Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often produce single scalar values, which may not capture the full range and nuance of model uncertainty across different aspects of a response. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret model confidence, potentially leading to misinterpretation of model outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like entropy of output distributions or calibrated confidence scores, which provide a simplified view of model uncertainty. Inspired by spectrum analysis in physics, we propose representing uncertainty as a multi-dimensional spectrum across different semantic aspects of a response. This approach aims to provide a richer and more informative uncertainty quantification, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of model confidence across various dimensions of its output. By leveraging the language understanding capabilities of large language models themselves, we can potentially generate and interpret these uncertainty spectra without the need for extensive additional training or external tools.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Spectrum Visualization Prompting (USVP), a multi-step prompting process that involves: 1) Decomposing the response into key semantic aspects. 2) For each aspect, prompting the model to generate a visual representation of its uncertainty as a spectrum (e.g., a color gradient from red to green). 3) Combining these spectra into a composite visualization. 4) Prompting the model to interpret and explain the visualization, providing a detailed breakdown of its uncertainty across different dimensions of the response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, and 2) XSum for text summarization. These datasets cover different types of language tasks and will allow us to evaluate USVP across diverse scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty quantification methods: 1) Entropy of output distribution: Calculate the entropy of the token probability distribution for the generated response. 2) Calibrated confidence scores: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the model's confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: USVP Implementation": "Implement the USVP method with the following sub-steps for each input:\na) Generate initial response\nb) Decompose response into aspects\nc) Generate uncertainty spectrum for each aspect\nd) Combine spectra into composite visualization\ne) Interpret the visualization",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of USVP. For example:\na) Initial response: 'Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]'\nb) Aspect decomposition: 'Identify the key semantic aspects of your previous answer.'\nc) Uncertainty spectrum: 'For the aspect \"[ASPECT]\", generate a visual representation of your uncertainty as a color spectrum from red (high uncertainty) to green (low uncertainty). Describe this spectrum in words.'\nd) Composite visualization: 'Combine the individual aspect spectra into a single composite visualization. Describe this visualization in words.'\ne) Interpretation: 'Interpret the composite visualization, explaining your uncertainty across different dimensions of your response.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments, as it represents a state-of-the-art large language model with strong reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate USVP against the baselines:\na) Correlation with human judgments: Recruit human annotators to rate the uncertainty of model responses, and calculate the correlation between these ratings and the uncertainty scores from each method.\nb) Calibration error: Calculate the expected calibration error (ECE) for each method.\nc) Qualitative assessment: Conduct a qualitative analysis of the richness and interpretability of the uncertainty representations produced by each method.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset:\na) Generate responses and uncertainty quantifications using the baseline methods and USVP.\nb) Collect human annotations for a subset of the responses.\nc) Calculate evaluation metrics.\nd) Perform qualitative analysis of the uncertainty representations.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of USVP against the baseline methods across all evaluation metrics. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, paying particular attention to the multi-dimensional nature of USVP's uncertainty representation."

I'm mostly certain about its location within France, although I haven't specified exact coordinates. I'm less certain about its historical significance as I haven't provided any historical context in my answer. This multi-dimensional uncertainty representation provides a more nuanced view of my confidence across different aspects of the response.",
                "Explanation": "USVP provides a richer, multi-dimensional representation of uncertainty, breaking down the model's confidence across different aspects of the response. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of where the model is more or less certain in its answer."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If USVP does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated uncertainty spectra to understand why they may not be effectively capturing model uncertainty. This could involve examining the correlation between different aspects of the spectra and actual error rates in model outputs. Second, we could explore variations of the USVP method, such as using different prompting strategies for aspect decomposition or uncertainty visualization. Finally, we could investigate how USVP performs across different types of tasks or domains, which might reveal specific areas where this approach is more or less effective. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the nature of uncertainty in large language models and inform future approaches to uncertainty quantification."
