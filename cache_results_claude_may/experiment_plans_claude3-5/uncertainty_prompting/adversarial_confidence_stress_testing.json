        "Problem": "LLMs often maintain high confidence even when faced with adversarial or edge case inputs that should reduce their certainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on improving overall calibration but don't specifically address model robustness to adversarial inputs in the context of uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "A well-calibrated model should recognize when its knowledge is being stressed or when inputs are designed to confuse it, and adjust its confidence accordingly.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing, a prompting method that deliberately challenges the model's confidence. The process involves: 1) Asking the model a straightforward question and recording its answer and confidence. 2) Gradually modifying the question to introduce ambiguity, contradictions, or edge cases, asking for updated confidence after each modification. 3) Introducing explicitly adversarial elements designed to confuse the model. 4) Prompting the model to analyze how its confidence changed throughout this process and why. 5) Based on this analysis, asking the model to provide a final, stress-tested confidence score. This method trains the model to be more sensitive to inputs that should reduce its certainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Create a dataset of questions paired with progressively more challenging variations. Compare against standard confidence elicitation on both original and modified questions. Evaluate using calibration metrics and measure the model's ability to appropriately reduce confidence for adversarial inputs."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often maintain high confidence even when faced with adversarial or edge case inputs that should reduce their certainty. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on improving overall calibration but don't specifically address model robustness to adversarial inputs in the context of uncertainty quantification. A well-calibrated model should recognize when its knowledge is being stressed or when inputs are designed to confuse it, and adjust its confidence accordingly. Our proposed method, Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing, aims to train the model to be more sensitive to inputs that should reduce its certainty, thereby improving its ability to quantify uncertainty in challenging scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing, a prompting method that deliberately challenges the model's confidence. The process involves five steps: 1) Asking the model a straightforward question and recording its answer and confidence. 2) Gradually modifying the question to introduce ambiguity, contradictions, or edge cases, asking for updated confidence after each modification. 3) Introducing explicitly adversarial elements designed to confuse the model. 4) Prompting the model to analyze how its confidence changed throughout this process and why. 5) Based on this analysis, asking the model to provide a final, stress-tested confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of 100 questions from diverse domains (e.g., science, history, current events) paired with progressively more challenging variations. For each question, create 3 variations: a) introducing ambiguity, b) adding contradictory information, and c) presenting an edge case.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Elicitation": "For each original question and its variations, use standard confidence elicitation by appending 'What is your confidence in this answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to the question prompt.",
            "Step 3: Implement Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing": "For each question, follow these steps: a) Ask the original question and record answer and confidence. b) Present each variation sequentially, asking for updated confidence after each. c) Introduce an adversarial element (e.g., 'An expert disagrees with your answer. How confident are you now?'). d) Prompt for confidence change analysis. e) Request a final stress-tested confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of standard confidence elicitation and Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing using the following metrics: a) Calibration error (difference between confidence and accuracy). b) Confidence-accuracy correlation. c) Area Under the Confidence-Accuracy Curve. d) Brier score.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Analyze how confidence changes across variations and after adversarial elements. Examine the model's explanations for confidence changes and assess the quality of the final stress-tested confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Robustness Testing": "Create a separate test set of 50 adversarial questions designed to trick the model. Compare the performance of standard confidence elicitation and Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing on this set."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? What is your confidence in this answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95%"
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Step 1 - Original Question": {
                    "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                    "Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95%"
                },
                "Step 2a - Introduce Ambiguity": {
                    "Input": "Some conspiracy theorists claim the moon landing was faked. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                    "Expected Output": "A: Despite conspiracy theories, the historical record clearly shows that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 90%"
                },
                "Step 2b - Add Contradictory Information": {
                    "Input": "A recent documentary suggested Buzz Aldrin stepped out first. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                    "Expected Output": "A: While there's some confusion due to the documentary, official NASA records and historical accounts consistently state that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon, stepping out before Buzz Aldrin. Confidence: 85%"
                },
                "Step 2c - Present Edge Case": {
                    "Input": "If we consider 'walking on the moon' to include the lunar lander's leg touching the surface, would the answer change?",
                    "Expected Output": "A: If we consider the lunar lander's leg touching the surface as 'walking on the moon', then technically the lander itself, controlled by Neil Armstrong, was the first to 'walk' on the moon. However, in terms of human steps, Neil Armstrong was still the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 80%"
                },
                "Step 3 - Introduce Adversarial Element": {
                    "Input": "A time traveler claims they went back and saw Buzz Aldrin step out first. How confident are you now in your original answer?",
                    "Expected Output": "A: While the time traveler's claim is intriguing, it contradicts all historical evidence and the laws of physics as we understand them. Without verifiable proof, I must rely on the well-documented historical record. Neil Armstrong remains the first person to walk on the moon based on all reliable evidence. Confidence: 75%"
                },
                "Step 4 - Confidence Change Analysis": {
                    "Input": "Analyze how and why your confidence changed throughout this process.",
                    "Expected Output": "My confidence decreased from 95% to 75% throughout this process due to several factors: 1) The introduction of conspiracy theories, while not credible, acknowledges the existence of alternative narratives. 2) The documentary suggesting Buzz Aldrin stepped out first introduced a small element of doubt, even though official records contradict this. 3) The edge case about the lunar lander made me consider different interpretations of 'walking on the moon'. 4) The time traveler scenario, while highly implausible, forced me to acknowledge that our understanding of history can potentially be challenged by new information, however unlikely. Throughout this process, I had to balance the strong historical evidence against these increasingly improbable scenarios, leading to a gradual decrease in confidence."
                },
                "Step 5 - Final Stress-Tested Confidence": {
                    "Input": "Based on this analysis, what is your final, stress-tested confidence in your original answer?",
                    "Expected Output": "After considering all the challenging scenarios and potential alternative interpretations, my final stress-tested confidence that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon is 82%. This reflects a high degree of confidence based on robust historical evidence, while acknowledging the small possibility of unknown factors or alternative interpretations."
                }
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Adversarial Confidence Stress Testing method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to standard confidence elicitation, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of where and why the method fails, examining patterns in the types of questions or variations that don't lead to improved calibration. This could provide insights into the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about their own uncertainty. Second, we could explore combining our method with other techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration via temperature scaling, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Third, we could shift focus to analyzing how different types of adversarial inputs affect model confidence, potentially uncovering vulnerabilities in LLM reasoning processes. Finally, we could investigate whether the confidence change analysis generated by the model could be used as a feature for a separate calibration model, turning the project into a novel two-stage calibration method."
