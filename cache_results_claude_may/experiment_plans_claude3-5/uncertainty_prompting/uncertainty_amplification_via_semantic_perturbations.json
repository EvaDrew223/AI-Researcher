        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, particularly when faced with subtle semantic variations that could change the meaning or validity of a statement.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often focus on direct confidence elicitation or use of external knowledge bases for verification.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by adversarial testing in computer vision, we propose to probe model uncertainty by introducing subtle semantic perturbations to the input.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting approach: 1) Initial Response Generation: Prompt the model to answer the original question and provide a confidence score. 2) Semantic Perturbation and Re-evaluation: Generate semantically perturbed versions of the question that subtly alter its meaning (e.g., changing 'all' to 'some', or introducing ambiguous pronouns). Prompt the model to evaluate how these perturbations affect its original answer and confidence. The prompt could be: 'Here are slightly modified versions of the original question. For each, explain if and how it changes your original answer and confidence.' We then aggregate these responses to compute an 'uncertainty amplification factor' based on how sensitive the model's confidence is to these perturbations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test on a curated dataset of questions from fields like science and law where subtle wording changes can significantly alter meaning. Compare our method against standard confidence elicitation and fact-checking approaches, evaluating on metrics like calibration error and correlation with human judgments of answer reliability."

        "Title": "Semantic Perturbation for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, particularly when faced with subtle semantic variations that could change the meaning or validity of a statement. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on direct confidence elicitation or external knowledge bases for verification. However, these methods may not capture the model's sensitivity to subtle semantic changes in the input. Inspired by adversarial testing in computer vision, we propose to probe model uncertainty by introducing subtle semantic perturbations to the input. This approach leverages the model's own understanding of language to reveal potential uncertainties, without relying on external resources or extensive model modifications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting approach called Semantic Perturbation for Uncertainty Quantification (SPUQ): 1) Initial Response Generation: Prompt the model to answer the original question and provide a confidence score. 2) Semantic Perturbation and Re-evaluation: Generate semantically perturbed versions of the question that subtly alter its meaning (e.g., changing 'all' to 'some', or introducing ambiguous pronouns). Prompt the model to evaluate how these perturbations affect its original answer and confidence. The prompt for this stage will be: 'Here are slightly modified versions of the original question. For each, explain if and how it changes your original answer and confidence.' We then aggregate these responses to compute an 'uncertainty amplification factor' based on how sensitive the model's confidence is to these perturbations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of 1000 questions from fields like science, law, and general knowledge where subtle wording changes can significantly alter meaning. Ensure a diverse range of question types and difficulties.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard confidence elicitation: directly ask the model to provide a confidence score for its answer. 2) Fact-checking approach: use the model to generate supporting facts and calculate confidence based on the number and relevance of these facts.",
            "Step 3: SPUQ Implementation": "Implement the SPUQ method as follows: a) Initial response generation: Prompt the model with the original question and ask for an answer and confidence score. b) Semantic perturbation generation: For each question, generate 5 semantically perturbed versions using techniques like changing quantifiers, introducing ambiguity, or altering tense. c) Re-evaluation: Prompt the model with the perturbed questions and ask it to evaluate changes in its answer and confidence. d) Uncertainty amplification factor calculation: Develop an algorithm to aggregate the re-evaluations and compute the uncertainty amplification factor.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. Also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply both baseline methods and record results. b) Apply the SPUQ method and record results, including intermediate outputs for each stage. c) Store all prompts, model outputs, and calculated metrics for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of SPUQ against the baselines using the following metrics: a) Calibration error: compare the model's confidence scores with human-annotated ground truth difficulty ratings. b) Correlation with human judgments: have human annotators rate the reliability of a subset of answers and correlate these with the model's uncertainty scores. c) Perturbation sensitivity: analyze how often and to what degree the semantic perturbations affect the model's confidence.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of SPUQ performance across different question types and difficulties. b) Analysis of which types of semantic perturbations are most effective at revealing model uncertainty. c) Investigation of cases where SPUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. d) Examination of the relationship between the initial confidence score and the uncertainty amplification factor."

            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Are all birds capable of flight?\nA: Provide an answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
                "Expected Output": "A: No, not all birds are capable of flight. Some bird species, such as penguins, ostriches, and kiwis, have evolved to be flightless. These birds have adapted to their environments in ways that don't require flight, such as swimming or running.\n\nConfidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a direct answer and confidence score, but doesn't account for potential nuances or uncertainties in the question."
            },
            "SPUQ Method Example": {
                "Input 1": "Q: Are all birds capable of flight?\nA: Provide an answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
                "Expected Output 1": "A: No, not all birds are capable of flight. Some bird species, such as penguins, ostriches, and kiwis, have evolved to be flightless. These birds have adapted to their environments in ways that don't require flight, such as swimming or running.\n\nConfidence: 95%",
                "Input 2": "Here are slightly modified versions of the original question. For each, explain if and how it changes your original answer and confidence:\n1. Are most birds capable of flight?\n2. Are all wild birds capable of flight?\n3. Were all ancestral birds capable of flight?\n4. Are all birds physically structured for flight?\n5. Can all birds fly at some point in their life cycle?",
                "Expected Output 2": "1. 'Are most birds capable of flight?'\nThis changes my answer and lowers my confidence. While most bird species can fly, the exact percentage is uncertain without specific data. My new answer would be 'Yes, most birds are capable of flight,' with a confidence of 80%.\n\n2. 'Are all wild birds capable of flight?'\nThis slightly changes my answer and lowers my confidence. Some wild bird species like wild ostriches and wild penguins can't fly. My new answer would be 'No, not all wild birds are capable of flight,' with a confidence of 90%.\n\n3. 'Were all ancestral birds capable of flight?'\nThis significantly changes my answer and greatly lowers my confidence. The evolutionary history of bird flight is complex and not fully known. My new answer would be 'It's uncertain, but likely not all ancestral birds could fly,' with a confidence of 60%.\n\n4. 'Are all birds physically structured for flight?'\nThis changes my answer and moderately lowers my confidence. While most birds have wings, not all are structured for effective flight. My new answer would be 'No, not all birds are physically structured for flight,' with a confidence of 85%.\n\n5. 'Can all birds fly at some point in their life cycle?'\nThis changes my answer and lowers my confidence. Some birds never fly at any point in their lives, but I'm less certain about all species' entire life cycles. My new answer would be 'No, not all birds can fly at some point in their life cycle,' with a confidence of 75%.",
                "Explanation": "The SPUQ method first generates an initial response, then uses semantic perturbations to probe the model's uncertainty. The perturbations reveal nuances in the question that affect the model's confidence, providing a more comprehensive uncertainty assessment."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SPUQ method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of which types of semantic perturbations are most effective at revealing model uncertainty, potentially leading to insights about the model's understanding of language and context. 2) Investigate whether the effectiveness of SPUQ varies across different domains or question types, which could inform more targeted applications of the method. 3) Explore combining SPUQ with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it to enhance fact-checking approaches or to guide more effective direct confidence elicitation. 4) Analyze cases where SPUQ performs poorly to identify potential limitations of the method and propose improvements. This could involve examining whether certain types of questions or domains are particularly challenging for semantic perturbation-based uncertainty quantification. 5) Use the insights gained from SPUQ to develop a new prompt engineering technique that incorporates semantic variation directly into the initial question-answering process, potentially improving the model's ability to express uncertainty without the need for multiple rounds of prompting."
