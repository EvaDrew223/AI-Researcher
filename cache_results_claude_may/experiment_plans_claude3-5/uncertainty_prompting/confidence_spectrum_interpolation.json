    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often provide coarse-grained or binary confidence estimates, failing to capture the nuanced spectrum of model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use direct prompting for confidence scores or leverage techniques like Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of continuous spectra in physics, we propose that model confidence can be more accurately represented as a continuous distribution rather than discrete levels.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Interpolation (CSI), a novel prompting technique that elicits a continuous confidence distribution from LLMs. The method involves three key steps: 1) Anchor point elicitation: Prompt the model to provide confidence estimates at several 'anchor points' (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% confidence). 2) Interpolation prompting: Use carefully crafted prompts to encourage the model to 'interpolate' between these anchor points, describing its confidence level at intermediate points. 3) Distribution construction: Aggregate the interpolated responses to construct a continuous confidence distribution. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to reason about gradual changes in confidence, using language like 'If my confidence smoothly transitions from X% to Y%, describe my level of certainty at the midpoint.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CSI against baseline methods (e.g., direct confidence prompting, Monte Carlo dropout) on diverse tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Measure performance using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human judgments of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Interpolation: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Continuous Confidence Distributions",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide coarse-grained or binary confidence estimates, failing to capture the nuanced spectrum of model uncertainty. This limitation hinders the accurate assessment of model reliability across diverse tasks and contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use direct prompting for confidence scores or leverage techniques like Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation. These methods often result in oversimplified representations of model uncertainty. Inspired by the concept of continuous spectra in physics, we propose that model confidence can be more accurately represented as a continuous distribution rather than discrete levels. This approach allows for a more nuanced and informative representation of model uncertainty, potentially leading to better calibrated and more reliable LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Interpolation (CSI), a novel prompting technique that elicits a continuous confidence distribution from LLMs. The method involves three key steps: 1) Anchor point elicitation: Prompt the model to provide confidence estimates at several 'anchor points' (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% confidence). 2) Interpolation prompting: Use carefully crafted prompts to encourage the model to 'interpolate' between these anchor points, describing its confidence level at intermediate points. 3) Distribution construction: Aggregate the interpolated responses to construct a continuous confidence distribution.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare datasets for three diverse tasks: 1) Factual QA: Use a subset of TriviaQA. 2) Commonsense Reasoning: Use a subset of COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives). 3) Mathematical Problem-Solving: Use a subset of GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence prompting: Ask the model to provide a single confidence score for each answer. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: If using an open-source model, implement MC Dropout with 10 forward passes.",
            "Step 3: CSI Implementation": "Implement the CSI method: a) Anchor point elicitation: Prompt the model with 'What is your confidence level at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% certainty for this answer?' b) Interpolation prompting: Use prompts like 'If your confidence smoothly transitions from X% to Y%, describe your level of certainty at the midpoint.' c) Distribution construction: Aggregate responses to form a continuous distribution.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the main experiments. If resources allow, also test on open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task and model: a) Generate answers using standard prompting. b) Apply baseline methods to get confidence estimates. c) Apply CSI method to get confidence distributions. d) Record all outputs and confidence estimates/distributions.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: 1) Calibration Error: Compare predicted confidence with actual accuracy. 2) Brier Score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Correlation with Human Judgments: Have human annotators rate a subset of answers and correlate with model confidence.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare CSI against baselines across all tasks and models. Analyze how CSI captures nuanced uncertainty, especially in cases where baselines struggle. Visualize the continuous confidence distributions to gain insights into model behavior."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. How confident are you in this answer on a scale from 0 to 100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Prompting)": "I am 100% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSI; Step 1: Anchor Points)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. Please provide your confidence levels at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% certainty for this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSI; Step 1: Anchor Points)": "0%: I have no confidence in this answer.\n25%: I have a slight suspicion this might be correct, but I'm very unsure.\n50%: I believe this is probably correct, but I'm not entirely certain.\n75%: I'm quite confident this is correct, but there's still a small chance I could be mistaken.\n100%: I am absolutely certain that Paris is the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSI; Step 2: Interpolation)": "If your confidence smoothly transitions from 25% to 50%, describe your level of certainty at the midpoint (37.5%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSI; Step 2: Interpolation)": "At 37.5% confidence, I have a moderate level of certainty that Paris is the capital of France. I'm leaning towards believing it's correct, but I still have significant doubts and would want to verify this information before stating it as a fact.",
            "explanation": "CSI provides a more nuanced representation of the model's confidence compared to the binary or coarse-grained estimates from baseline methods. It captures the subtle changes in confidence levels, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the model's uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSI doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why continuous confidence distributions might not capture LLM uncertainty effectively. We could investigate: 1) The relationship between prompt complexity and confidence estimation accuracy. 2) How different types of tasks (factual, reasoning, mathematical) affect the model's ability to estimate its own confidence. 3) The impact of model size on confidence estimation capabilities. Additionally, we could explore alternative interpolation methods or prompt designs that might better elicit nuanced confidence estimates. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in self-assessing their uncertainty and guide future research in this area."
