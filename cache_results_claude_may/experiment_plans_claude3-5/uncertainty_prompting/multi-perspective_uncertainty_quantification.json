    "idea_name": "Multi-Perspective Uncertainty Quantification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often rely on a single perspective, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like softmax probabilities or single-prompt confidence elicitation, which provide limited insight into model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating multiple expert perspectives, we can obtain a more comprehensive view of model uncertainty, similar to how human experts might approach a problem from different angles.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Perspective Uncertainty Quantification (MPUQ), a prompting strategy that leverages role-playing to assess uncertainty from various viewpoints. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Assume the roles of 3-5 diverse experts (e.g., statistician, domain specialist, skeptic), 2) For each role, provide an answer and confidence level, explaining the reasoning, 3) Identify areas of agreement and disagreement among the experts, 4) Synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate based on the multi-perspective analysis. The uncertainty is quantified by considering both inter-expert agreement and individual confidence levels.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MPUQ with single-perspective methods on tasks requiring diverse expertise, such as interdisciplinary problem-solving and complex decision-making scenarios. Evaluate using metrics like Uncertainty Calibration Error (UCE) and test the method's ability to identify true out-of-distribution queries."

        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Uncertainty Quantification: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on a single perspective, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex tasks. This limitation can lead to overconfident or poorly calibrated predictions, potentially resulting in unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like softmax probabilities or single-prompt confidence elicitation, which provide limited insight into model uncertainty. These methods often fail to account for the diverse sources of uncertainty that can arise in complex reasoning tasks. By simulating multiple expert perspectives, we can obtain a more comprehensive view of model uncertainty, similar to how human experts might approach a problem from different angles. This approach has the potential to provide more nuanced and reliable uncertainty estimates, leading to better-calibrated LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Perspective Uncertainty Quantification (MPUQ), a prompting strategy that leverages role-playing to assess uncertainty from various viewpoints. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Assume the roles of 3-5 diverse experts (e.g., statistician, domain specialist, skeptic). 2) For each role, provide an answer and confidence level, explaining the reasoning. 3) Identify areas of agreement and disagreement among the experts. 4) Synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate based on the multi-perspective analysis. The uncertainty is quantified by considering both inter-expert agreement and individual confidence levels.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that require diverse expertise and complex decision-making. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and reasoning, b) BIG-Bench's 'logical_fallacy_detection' for evaluating critical thinking, and c) MedQA for domain-specific medical reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: simply ask the model to answer and provide a confidence score. b) Single-perspective confidence elicitation: ask the model to answer, then separately prompt for confidence. c) Ensemble method: use multiple independent model calls and aggregate results.",
            "Step 3: MPUQ Implementation": "Develop the MPUQ prompting strategy. For each question: a) Define 3-5 expert roles relevant to the task. b) Prompt the model to assume each role sequentially, providing answers and confidence levels. c) Prompt for analysis of agreement/disagreement. d) Prompt for a final synthesized answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and MPUQ): a) Generate answers and uncertainty estimates for all questions. b) Calculate evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Uncertainty Calibration Error (UCE), and Brier Score.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Compare MPUQ performance against baselines across all datasets. b) Analyze how MPUQ performs on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning). c) Examine the diversity of perspectives generated and their impact on final uncertainty estimates. d) Investigate cases where MPUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a correct answer but with overconfident uncertainty estimation, failing to account for potential ambiguity or the possibility of error."
            },
            "Example 2 (MPUQ Success)": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please answer from the perspective of multiple experts, then synthesize a final answer with an uncertainty estimate.",
                "Output (MPUQ)": "Expert 1 (Historian): The capital of France is Paris. This has been the case since 987 CE when Hugh Capet made it the capital of his kingdom. Confidence: 95%\n\nExpert 2 (Geographer): While Paris is indeed the capital of France, it's worth noting that some countries have multiple capitals or have changed capitals over time. For France, Paris is unequivocally the capital. Confidence: 98%\n\nExpert 3 (Skeptic): Although Paris is widely recognized as the capital of France, we should consider the possibility of recent changes or nuances in the definition of 'capital'. However, I find no credible evidence to suggest any change. Confidence: 90%\n\nAreas of Agreement: All experts agree that Paris is the capital of France.\nAreas of Disagreement: Slight variations in confidence levels, with the skeptic being the least confident.\n\nSynthesized Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Given the high agreement among experts and their individual confidence levels, we can assign a high overall confidence to this answer. However, accounting for the skeptic's valid point about potential recent changes, we should maintain a small degree of uncertainty.\n\nFinal Uncertainty Estimate: 95% confident (5% uncertainty)",
                "Explanation": "MPUQ provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by considering multiple perspectives. It acknowledges the high confidence in the answer while still maintaining a small degree of uncertainty, which is more realistic and better calibrated than the overconfident baseline."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MPUQ does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the quality and diversity of generated expert perspectives, the effectiveness of the synthesis process, and how well the method captures different sources of uncertainty. We could also explore variations of MPUQ, such as adjusting the number or types of expert roles, or modifying the synthesis process. Additionally, we might investigate whether MPUQ performs better on certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply multi-perspective approaches effectively. If these analyses yield interesting findings, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth study of how LLMs generate and synthesize multiple perspectives, potentially uncovering new insights about their reasoning capabilities and limitations."
