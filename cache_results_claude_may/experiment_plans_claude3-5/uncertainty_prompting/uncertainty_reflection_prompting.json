    "idea_name": "Uncertainty Reflection Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions on tasks they are not well-equipped to handle.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods often rely on model logits or multiple forward passes, which can be computationally expensive and not always accessible.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often assess their own uncertainty by reflecting on their thought process and identifying potential flaws or gaps in their reasoning. We can leverage this metacognitive ability in language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Reflection Prompting (URP), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model to reflect on its own reasoning process. First, we prompt the model to generate an initial answer along with a step-by-step reasoning chain. Then, we ask the model to critically analyze each step of its reasoning, identifying potential weaknesses or alternative interpretations. Finally, we prompt the model to synthesize this reflection into a calibrated confidence score and potentially revised answer. This method encourages the model to engage in self-critique and uncertainty awareness without relying on model internals or multiple samples.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate URP against standard prompting, confidence elicitation, and logit-based methods on a range of tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. We'll use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score to assess calibration, as well as task-specific accuracy measures to ensure the reflection process doesn't degrade performance."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Reflection Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions on tasks they are not well-equipped to handle. This can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis or financial advice.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as temperature scaling and ensemble methods, often rely on model internals or multiple forward passes, which can be computationally expensive and not always accessible. Inspired by human metacognition, where individuals reflect on their thought processes to identify potential flaws or gaps in reasoning, we propose a novel prompting technique that encourages LLMs to engage in self-critique and uncertainty awareness without relying on model internals or multiple samples.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Reflection Prompting (URP), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model to reflect on its own reasoning process. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Initial answer generation with reasoning chain, 2) Critical self-analysis of the reasoning steps, and 3) Synthesis of the reflection into a calibrated confidence score and potentially revised answer. This approach leverages the model's ability to generate and critique its own thought process, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates and improved overall performance.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets for evaluation: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and 3) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving. These datasets cover a range of task types and difficulty levels, allowing us to assess the method's effectiveness across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models are widely used and represent different capability levels, allowing us to assess how URP performs across model sizes.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Confidence elicitation (asking the model to provide a confidence score), and c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence elicitation.",
            "Step 4: URP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Reflection Prompting method with the following steps: a) Initial answer generation with reasoning chain, b) Critical self-analysis prompt, and c) Reflection synthesis and confidence calibration prompt.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Accuracy for task performance, b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for calibration assessment, c) Brier score for probabilistic forecast evaluation, and d) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for discrimination ability.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run all baseline methods and collect results, b) Run the URP method and collect results, c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for both baselines and URP.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare URP performance against baselines across all metrics and datasets, b) Analyze the quality and relevance of self-reflection generated by URP, c) Investigate how URP performance varies across different task types and difficulty levels, d) Examine the relationship between the model's initial confidence and post-reflection confidence.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each URP component: a) Remove the critical self-analysis step, b) Remove the reflection synthesis step, c) Vary the number of reasoning steps in the initial answer generation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: [Your answer]\nConfidence (0-100):",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.\nConfidence (0-100): 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (URP Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer along with a step-by-step reasoning chain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (URP Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Step 1: Recall that France is a country in Western Europe.\nStep 2: Remember that the capital of a country is typically its most important city, often serving as the seat of government.\nStep 3: Recall that Paris is a major city in France, known for its historical and cultural significance.\nStep 4: Confirm that Paris is indeed the political and administrative center of France.\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (URP Step 2: Critical Self-Analysis)": "Now, critically analyze each step of your reasoning. Identify any potential weaknesses, assumptions, or alternative interpretations.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (URP Step 2: Critical Self-Analysis)": "Step 1: This step is factually correct but doesn't directly contribute to answering the question.\nStep 2: This definition of a capital city is generally accurate, but there are exceptions (e.g., some countries have multiple capitals).\nStep 3: While Paris is indeed a major city in France, this step doesn't prove it's the capital.\nStep 4: This step confirms Paris as the capital but doesn't provide specific evidence (e.g., location of government buildings).\nOverall, the reasoning is logical but relies on general knowledge without citing specific, verifiable facts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (URP Step 3: Reflection Synthesis)": "Based on your initial answer and critical analysis, provide a final answer with a calibrated confidence score (0-100) and explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (URP Step 3: Reflection Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nCalibrated Confidence Score: 98\nExplanation: Despite the lack of specific citations in my reasoning, the fact that Paris is the capital of France is widely known and easily verifiable. The critical analysis revealed that my reasoning could have been more robust, but it didn't uncover any significant doubts about the answer. The high confidence score reflects the strong certainty in this well-established fact, with a small margin for the remote possibility of recent, unknown changes.",
            "explanation": "The URP method encourages the model to engage in a more thorough reasoning process, including self-critique. This leads to a more nuanced final response with a well-calibrated confidence score, as opposed to the potentially overconfident outputs from standard prompting or simple confidence elicitation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the URP method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why URP fails, which could lead to insights about LLM reasoning and uncertainty estimation. Second, we could explore variations of the URP method, such as iterative refinement where the model goes through multiple rounds of reflection, or incorporating external knowledge sources in the reflection process. Third, we could investigate how different prompting strategies affect the quality of self-reflection and uncertainty estimation, potentially leading to a study on optimal prompting for metacognition in LLMs. Lastly, if the results are inconsistent across tasks or models, we could focus on analyzing these differences to gain insights into how model size and task complexity interact with uncertainty estimation capabilities."
