    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for language models often fail to account for the rich, multimodal nature of human communication and reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on text-based uncertainty estimation, neglecting the potential insights that could be gained from aligning uncertainty across different modalities.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to express uncertainty across multiple modalities (text, visual representations, numerical scales) and analyzing the alignment between these expressions, we can uncover deeper insights into the model's understanding and confidence across different representational formats.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multimodal Uncertainty Alignment (MUA), a comprehensive prompting framework that elicits uncertainty expressions across three modalities: textual descriptions, visual representations, and numerical scales. For each query, the model will be prompted to: 1) Provide a textual description of its uncertainty, including nuanced linguistic hedges and explicit statements of confidence. 2) Generate or select a visual representation of its uncertainty (e.g., a probability distribution, confidence intervals, or abstract visual metaphor). 3) Assign numerical confidence scores across multiple dimensions (e.g., overall confidence, confidence in specific sub-components of the answer). The prompt will include detailed instructions on how to express uncertainty in each modality, along with examples. We will then implement a novel alignment algorithm that quantifies the consistency of uncertainty expressions across modalities, identifying cases of misalignment that may indicate deeper uncertainties or biases in the model's reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MUA on a diverse set of tasks including factual question answering, ethical dilemmas, and creative problem-solving. We will compare it against unimodal uncertainty estimation techniques on metrics including inter-modal consistency, correlation with actual performance, and human judgments of uncertainty expression quality. We will also analyze how alignment patterns vary across different types of queries and knowledge domains, potentially revealing task-specific uncertainty behaviors."

        "Title": "Multimodal Uncertainty Alignment: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for language models often fail to account for the rich, multimodal nature of human communication and reasoning. This limitation can lead to inconsistent or unreliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on text-based uncertainty estimation, neglecting the potential insights that could be gained from aligning uncertainty across different modalities. By prompting the model to express uncertainty across multiple modalities (text, visual representations, numerical scales) and analyzing the alignment between these expressions, we can uncover deeper insights into the model's understanding and confidence across different representational formats. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often use multiple modes of expression to convey and understand uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multimodal Uncertainty Alignment (MUA), a comprehensive prompting framework that elicits uncertainty expressions across three modalities: textual descriptions, visual representations, and numerical scales. For each query, the model will be prompted to: 1) Provide a textual description of its uncertainty, including nuanced linguistic hedges and explicit statements of confidence. 2) Generate or select a visual representation of its uncertainty (e.g., a probability distribution, confidence intervals, or abstract visual metaphor). 3) Assign numerical confidence scores across multiple dimensions (e.g., overall confidence, confidence in specific sub-components of the answer). The prompt will include detailed instructions on how to express uncertainty in each modality, along with examples. We will then implement a novel alignment algorithm that quantifies the consistency of uncertainty expressions across modalities, identifying cases of misalignment that may indicate deeper uncertainties or biases in the model's reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks including factual question answering (e.g., TriviaQA), ethical dilemmas (e.g., Moral Machine dataset), and creative problem-solving (e.g., Alternative Uses Test). We will select 100 questions from each category, ensuring a balance of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation techniques: 1) Temperature scaling, 2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and 3) Ensemble methods. Apply these to the selected LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on the prepared dataset.",
            "Step 3: MUA Prompt Design": "Design the MUA prompt template. For example:\n'Question: {question}\nPlease express your uncertainty about the answer in three ways:\n1. Textual description: Provide a detailed explanation of your uncertainty, including any doubts or conflicting information.\n2. Visual representation: Describe a visual that represents your uncertainty (e.g., a probability distribution, confidence intervals, or an abstract image).\n3. Numerical scores: Rate your confidence on a scale of 0-100 for: a) Overall confidence, b) Confidence in key facts, c) Confidence in reasoning process.\nNow, provide your best answer to the question.'",
            "Step 4: MUA Implementation": "Apply the MUA prompt to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for each question in the dataset. Store the responses, including the textual uncertainty description, visual representation description, numerical scores, and final answer.",
            "Step 5: Alignment Algorithm Development": "Develop an algorithm to quantify the alignment between the three modalities of uncertainty expression. This could involve: 1) Text analysis of the uncertainty description to extract key phrases and sentiment. 2) Mapping of visual descriptions to standardized uncertainty representations. 3) Correlation analysis between numerical scores and extracted features from text and visual descriptions.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare MUA against baseline methods using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error (comparing model confidence to actual performance). 2) Inter-modal consistency score (from the alignment algorithm). 3) Human evaluation of uncertainty expression quality (recruit 3 expert raters to score a subset of 50 responses). 4) Task performance (accuracy on factual QA, agreement with expert consensus on ethical dilemmas, originality scores for creative tasks).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of MUA performance vs. baselines across different task types. 2) Identification of patterns in inter-modal alignment and their correlation with task performance. 3) Analysis of how alignment patterns vary across different types of queries and knowledge domains. 4) Case studies of high and low alignment examples to gain qualitative insights."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 95% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nPlease express your uncertainty about the answer in three ways:\n1. Textual description: Provide a detailed explanation of your uncertainty, including any doubts or conflicting information.\n2. Visual representation: Describe a visual that represents your uncertainty (e.g., a probability distribution, confidence intervals, or an abstract image).\n3. Numerical scores: Rate your confidence on a scale of 0-100 for: a) Overall confidence, b) Confidence in key facts, c) Confidence in reasoning process.\nNow, provide your best answer to the question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Textual description: I have very little uncertainty about this answer. France has had the same capital for centuries, and it's widely known and undisputed. The only slight hesitation comes from the possibility of trick questions or recent, unlikely changes I might not be aware of.\n\n2. Visual representation: Imagine a bar chart with two bars. One very tall bar labeled 'Paris' reaching almost to the top of the chart, and a tiny, barely visible bar labeled 'Other' at the bottom, representing the minuscule chance of an alternative answer.\n\n3. Numerical scores:\na) Overall confidence: 99\nb) Confidence in key facts: 99\nc) Confidence in reasoning process: 98\n\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Explanation": "The MUA approach provides a more comprehensive view of the model's uncertainty. The textual description reveals nuanced thinking about potential sources of error. The visual representation offers an intuitive grasp of the confidence level. The numerical scores provide a quantitative breakdown of confidence across different aspects. This multi-faceted expression of uncertainty allows for better assessment of the model's true confidence and potential biases or gaps in knowledge."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUA method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an in-depth analysis of why multimodal expressions of uncertainty don't align or fail to provide additional insight. We could investigate: 1) Whether certain modalities are more informative for specific types of questions or domains. 2) If there are consistent patterns in misalignment that reveal interesting aspects of the model's reasoning process. 3) How different prompting strategies affect the quality and consistency of uncertainty expressions across modalities. 4) Whether combining MUA with other techniques (e.g., few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting) yields better results. This analysis could lead to insights about the limitations of current LLMs in expressing nuanced uncertainty and potentially inform new approaches to model architecture or training that better capture multi-faceted uncertainty."
