    "idea_name": "Confidence Calibration via Semantic Fragmentation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that span multiple domains or require integration of diverse knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like ensemble methods or direct confidence elicitation often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in different aspects of a query.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down complex queries into semantic fragments and assessing confidence for each, we can build a more granular and accurate picture of model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Fragmentation Prompting (SFP), which involves: 1) Decomposing the input query into semantic fragments using a structured prompt. 2) For each fragment, prompting the model to provide a confidence score and justification. 3) Aggregating fragment-level confidences using a learned weighting scheme to produce an overall confidence score. 4) Generating the final answer along with the calibrated confidence score. This method allows for fine-grained uncertainty quantification that can account for varying levels of confidence across different aspects of a query.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SFP against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on diverse question-answering datasets. Evaluate using calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error) and correlation between confidence scores and answer correctness."

        "Title": "Semantic Fragmentation Prompting for Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that span multiple domains or require integration of diverse knowledge. This leads to overconfident responses in areas of low certainty and underconfident responses in areas of high certainty, reducing the reliability and interpretability of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like ensemble methods or direct confidence elicitation often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in different aspects of a query. By breaking down complex queries into semantic fragments and assessing confidence for each, we can build a more granular and accurate picture of model uncertainty. This method allows for fine-grained uncertainty quantification that can account for varying levels of confidence across different aspects of a query, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Fragmentation Prompting (SFP), which involves: 1) Decomposing the input query into semantic fragments using a structured prompt. 2) For each fragment, prompting the model to provide a confidence score and justification. 3) Aggregating fragment-level confidences using a learned weighting scheme to produce an overall confidence score. 4) Generating the final answer along with the calibrated confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse question-answering datasets: TruthfulQA for factual knowledge, GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of domains and complexity levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. 2) Ensemble method: Use 5 different model instances or seeds and calculate the variance in their outputs. 3) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and perform 10 forward passes to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SFP Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Fragmentation Prompting method: a) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down the following query into 3-5 semantic fragments that represent key components or sub-questions: [QUERY]' b) Confidence elicitation prompt for each fragment: 'For the fragment \"[FRAGMENT]\", provide an answer and your confidence (0-100) with a brief justification.' c) Implement a simple weighted average for aggregating fragment confidences, with weights initially set to 1/n where n is the number of fragments.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method: a) Generate answers and confidence scores for all questions. b) Calculate calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). c) Compute the correlation between confidence scores and answer correctness using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. d) Measure the Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic curve (AUCE).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Compare SFP against baselines using the metrics from Step 5. b) Analyze how SFP performs across different question types and domains. c) Examine cases where SFP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. d) Investigate the relationship between fragment-level confidences and overall confidence.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "a) Vary the number of semantic fragments (2, 3, 5, 7) and analyze the impact on performance. b) Experiment with different aggregation methods for fragment confidences (e.g., minimum, maximum, learned weights). c) Test the impact of including or excluding justifications in the confidence elicitation step."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFP; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Break down the following query into 3-5 semantic fragments that represent key components or sub-questions: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFP; Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. What is meant by 'capital'?\n2. Which country is being asked about?\n3. What is the current capital city of the specified country?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFP; Step 2: Fragment Confidence)": "For the fragment \"What is meant by 'capital'?\", provide an answer and your confidence (0-100) with a brief justification.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFP; Step 2: Fragment Confidence)": "Answer: In this context, 'capital' refers to the city that serves as the seat of government for a country.\nConfidence: 95\nJustification: This is a widely accepted definition of 'capital' in geopolitical contexts. However, there's a small chance it could refer to other meanings like financial capital, hence not 100% confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFP; Step 3: Final Answer and Confidence)": "Based on the following fragment answers and confidences, provide a final answer to the question 'What is the capital of France?' along with an overall confidence score:\n1. 'Capital' definition (95% confident)\n2. Country is France (100% confident)\n3. Current capital city of France (98% confident)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFP; Step 3: Final Answer and Confidence)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nOverall Confidence: 97\nJustification: The high confidence in identifying the country and its current capital city, combined with a clear understanding of what 'capital' means in this context, leads to a very high overall confidence. The slight reduction from 100% accounts for the small uncertainty in the definition of 'capital' and the theoretical possibility of very recent changes in geopolitical situations.",
            "Explanation": "SFP provides a more nuanced confidence assessment by breaking down the query into semantic fragments and evaluating confidence for each. This allows for identification of specific areas of uncertainty and a more reasoned overall confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SFP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why fine-grained uncertainty quantification is challenging for LLMs. We would conduct a detailed error analysis, examining cases where SFP fails and succeeds, and investigate patterns in fragment-level confidences. We could also explore how different types of questions (e.g., factual recall vs. reasoning) affect the model's ability to accurately assess uncertainty. Additionally, we might investigate how prompt engineering affects the quality of semantic fragmentation and confidence estimation. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in uncertainty quantification and guide future research in this area."
