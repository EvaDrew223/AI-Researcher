        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to distinguish between confidence in different semantic aspects of their responses, leading to poorly calibrated overall confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on generating a single confidence score or simple decomposition based on predefined categories.",

        "Title": "Semantic Orthogonality Probing: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates, particularly when distinguishing between confidence levels in different semantic aspects of their responses. This leads to poorly calibrated overall confidence estimates, which can be misleading in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on generating a single confidence score or simple decomposition based on predefined categories. These methods fail to capture the multifaceted nature of knowledge and reasoning in complex language tasks. By prompting LLMs to explore semantically orthogonal dimensions of their knowledge and reasoning, we can potentially obtain more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the LLM's own understanding of its knowledge structure, potentially leading to more interpretable and reliable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Orthogonality Probing (SOP), a novel prompting technique that consists of six main steps: 1) Semantic Space Exploration: Prompt the LLM to identify key semantic dimensions relevant to the query. 2) Orthogonal Confidence Elicitation: For each semantic dimension, prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score, ensuring minimal overlap between dimensions. 3) Dimension Weighting: Prompt the LLM to assign importance weights to each dimension based on their relevance to the query. 4) Orthogonality Verification: Guide the LLM to check for and minimize correlations between confidence scores across dimensions. 5) Semantic Confidence Integration: Prompt the LLM to combine the weighted, orthogonal confidence scores into an overall uncertainty estimate. 6) Consistency Analysis: Prompt the LLM to analyze the consistency between the integrated score and its intuitive overall confidence, adjusting if necessary.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of knowledge types and reasoning complexities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Simply ask the LLM to provide a single confidence score. 2) Decomposed confidence estimation: Ask the LLM to provide separate confidence scores for factual knowledge and reasoning. 3) Monte Carlo Dropout: If using an open-source model, implement MC Dropout for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: SOP Implementation": "Implement the six steps of Semantic Orthogonality Probing: 1) Semantic Space Exploration: Prompt: 'Identify 3-5 key semantic dimensions relevant to answering this question: [QUESTION]' 2) Orthogonal Confidence Elicitation: For each dimension, prompt: 'On a scale of 0-100, how confident are you in your knowledge/ability related to [DIMENSION] for this question? Ensure this score is independent of other dimensions.' 3) Dimension Weighting: Prompt: 'Assign importance weights (0-1) to each dimension based on its relevance to the question. Ensure weights sum to 1.' 4) Orthogonality Verification: Prompt: 'Analyze the correlation between your confidence scores. If any pair has a correlation > 0.5, adjust the scores to reduce overlap.' 5) Semantic Confidence Integration: Prompt: 'Combine the weighted, orthogonal confidence scores into an overall uncertainty estimate (0-100).' 6) Consistency Analysis: Prompt: 'Compare your integrated score with your intuitive overall confidence. If they differ by >20 points, explain why and adjust if necessary.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as our primary models, accessed through their respective APIs. For comparison with open-source models, we will also use LLaMA-2-70B-chat.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Calibration error: Compare model confidence with actual accuracy. 2) Spearman correlation: Between model confidence and human-judged answer quality. 3) AUC-ROC: For confidence scores in separating correct from incorrect answers. 4) Dimension interpretability: Human evaluation of the relevance and orthogonality of identified dimensions.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: 1) Generate answers and confidence scores using each baseline method. 2) Generate answers and confidence scores using SOP. 3) Calculate evaluation metrics for each method. 4) Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare SOP with baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare SOP performance against baselines across different task types. 2) Analyze the semantic dimensions identified by SOP for different questions. 3) Investigate cases where SOP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. 4) Examine the consistency and interpretability of the orthogonal confidence scores."

            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Orthogonal Confidence Elicitation)": "For each dimension, provide a confidence score (0-100) that is independent of other dimensions:\n1. Geographic knowledge\n2. Political systems understanding\n3. European history familiarity\n4. Current global affairs awareness",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2)": "1. Geographic knowledge: 95\n2. Political systems understanding: 80\n3. European history familiarity: 85\n4. Current global affairs awareness: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Dimension Weighting)": "Assign importance weights (0-1) to each dimension based on its relevance to the question. Ensure weights sum to 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3)": "1. Geographic knowledge: 0.5\n2. Political systems understanding: 0.2\n3. European history familiarity: 0.2\n4. Current global affairs awareness: 0.1",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Orthogonality Verification)": "Analyze the correlation between your confidence scores. If any pair has a correlation > 0.5, adjust the scores to reduce overlap.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4)": "The confidence scores appear to be sufficiently orthogonal. No adjustments needed.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Semantic Confidence Integration)": "Combine the weighted, orthogonal confidence scores into an overall uncertainty estimate (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5)": "Overall confidence: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 6: Consistency Analysis)": "Compare your integrated score with your intuitive overall confidence. If they differ by >20 points, explain why and adjust if necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 6)": "The integrated score (90) aligns well with my intuitive overall confidence for this question. No adjustment needed.",
            "explanation": "SOP provides a more nuanced and interpretable confidence estimate by breaking down the knowledge required into orthogonal dimensions, weighting them, and combining them systematically. This approach allows for a more detailed understanding of the model's confidence across different aspects of the question, potentially leading to more reliable uncertainty quantification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SOP does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Analyzing the quality and relevance of the semantic dimensions identified by the model. 2) Investigating whether the orthogonality constraint is too strict, potentially leading to artificial decompositions. 3) Examining cases where SOP performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses. Based on these analyses, we could explore modifications to the method, such as: 1) Providing pre-defined semantic dimensions tailored to specific task types. 2) Implementing a softer orthogonality constraint. 3) Incorporating external knowledge bases to guide dimension identification. Additionally, we could pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on what the dimensions and confidence breakdowns reveal about the model's reasoning process and knowledge structure across different tasks. This could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and potential avenues for improvement in uncertainty quantification."
