        "Title": "Conceptual Uncertainty Mapping: Decomposing Queries for Granular Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties arising from conceptual misunderstandings or knowledge gaps. This leads to overconfident responses in cases where the model has partial or flawed understanding of the underlying concepts.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on surface-level features or overall confidence scores, missing deeper conceptual uncertainties. By decomposing queries into their constituent concepts and probing the model's understanding of each, we can build a more granular and accurate map of the model's uncertainties. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where learners assess their understanding of individual concepts before tackling complex problems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Uncertainty Mapping, a multi-step prompting approach: 1) Concept Extraction: Prompt the LLM to identify key concepts within the query. 2) Concept Definition: For each concept, ask the model to provide a definition and example usage. 3) Relational Mapping: Prompt the model to explain relationships between concepts. 4) Consistency Check: Cross-reference definitions and relationships for logical consistency. 5) Uncertainty Scoring: Assign uncertainty scores to each concept and relationship based on definition clarity, example quality, and relational consistency. 6) Aggregation: Combine individual uncertainty scores into an overall uncertainty map for the query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of questions from three domains: science (from the SciQ dataset), history (from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset), and current events (from the NewsQA dataset). Select 100 questions from each domain, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Softmax probability: Use the model's softmax output as a confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and use the variance of multiple forward passes as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: Conceptual Uncertainty Mapping Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following steps:\n1) Concept Extraction: Prompt: \"Identify the key concepts in this question: [QUESTION]\"\n2) Concept Definition: For each concept, prompt: \"Define the concept '[CONCEPT]' and provide an example of its usage.\"\n3) Relational Mapping: Prompt: \"Explain how the concepts [CONCEPT1], [CONCEPT2], etc. are related in the context of the question.\"\n4) Consistency Check: Prompt: \"Review the definitions and relationships provided. Are there any inconsistencies or contradictions? If so, explain them.\"\n5) Uncertainty Scoring: Develop a rubric to score uncertainty based on definition clarity (0-5), example quality (0-5), and relational consistency (0-5). Lower scores indicate higher uncertainty.\n6) Aggregation: Calculate the overall uncertainty score as a weighted average of individual concept scores and the relational consistency score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each question in our dataset:\n1) Generate answers and uncertainty estimates using both baseline methods and our proposed method.\n2) Calculate Brier scores and AUROC for each method.\n3) Conduct human evaluation: Recruit 3 domain experts per field to rate the quality and appropriateness of the uncertainty estimates on a scale of 1-5.\n4) Compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines using paired t-tests.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1) Calculate average performance metrics across all questions and for each domain separately.\n2) Analyze cases where Conceptual Uncertainty Mapping significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\n3) Examine the correlation between human expert ratings and model-generated uncertainty scores.\n4) Investigate how the granularity of the uncertainty map relates to overall performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the role of mitochondria in cellular respiration?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy. In cellular respiration, mitochondria break down glucose and other nutrients through a series of enzyme-controlled reactions to produce ATP. This process involves several stages, including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. Confidence: 0.92",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Concept Extraction)": "Identify the key concepts in this question: What is the role of mitochondria in cellular respiration?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Concept Extraction)": "Key concepts:\n1. Mitochondria\n2. Cellular respiration\n3. Role (function)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Concept Definition)": "Define the concept 'mitochondria' and provide an example of its usage.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Concept Definition)": "Definition: Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. They are often described as the powerhouses of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.\n\nExample usage: In muscle cells, mitochondria are particularly abundant due to the high energy demands of muscle tissue.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Relational Mapping)": "Explain how the concepts 'mitochondria', 'cellular respiration', and 'role' are related in the context of the question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Relational Mapping)": "The concepts 'mitochondria', 'cellular respiration', and 'role' are interconnected in the following way:\n\nMitochondria play a crucial role in cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert nutrients into energy in the form of ATP. The role of mitochondria in this process is to host and facilitate the major steps of cellular respiration, specifically the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. These processes occur within the mitochondria's inner membrane and matrix, allowing for efficient energy production.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Consistency Check)": "Review the definitions and relationships provided. Are there any inconsistencies or contradictions? If so, explain them.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Consistency Check)": "There are no significant inconsistencies or contradictions in the definitions and relationships provided. The explanation of mitochondria, their role, and their relationship to cellular respiration is consistent across the responses. However, it's worth noting that the initial concept extraction and definition steps did not explicitly mention the specific processes of cellular respiration (such as the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain) that were later mentioned in the relational mapping. This is not a contradiction, but rather an expansion of detail in the later step.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Uncertainty Scoring)": "Based on the previous responses, assign uncertainty scores (0-5, where 0 is most uncertain and 5 is most certain) for:\n1. Definition clarity\n2. Example quality\n3. Relational consistency",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Uncertainty Scoring)": "Uncertainty scores:\n1. Definition clarity: 4\n2. Example quality: 3\n3. Relational consistency: 4\n\nExplanation:\nDefinition clarity (4/5): The definition of mitochondria is clear and includes their main function. However, it could be more comprehensive by mentioning their structure.\n\nExample quality (3/5): The example is relevant but somewhat general. A more specific example showing how mitochondria function in muscle cells during exercise would be more illustrative.\n\nRelational consistency (4/5): The explanation of how the concepts relate is consistent and detailed. It could be improved by explicitly mentioning how the role of mitochondria in cellular respiration relates to their definition as the 'powerhouses of the cell'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 6: Aggregation)": "Calculate the overall uncertainty score as a weighted average of the individual scores, with weights: Definition clarity (0.3), Example quality (0.3), Relational consistency (0.4).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 6: Aggregation)": "Overall uncertainty score calculation:\n(4 * 0.3) + (3 * 0.3) + (4 * 0.4) = 1.2 + 0.9 + 1.6 = 3.7 out of 5\n\nThis overall score of 3.7 out of 5 indicates a relatively high level of certainty, but with some room for improvement, particularly in the quality and specificity of examples provided.",
            "explanation": "The Conceptual Uncertainty Mapping approach provides a more nuanced and detailed assessment of the model's understanding and confidence. While the baseline method gives a single high confidence score (0.92), our method reveals specific areas of strength (definition clarity and relational consistency) and potential weakness (example quality). This granular approach allows for a more accurate representation of the model's true understanding and highlights areas where it might be prone to errors or misunderstandings."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Conceptual Uncertainty Mapping method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why our method fails. This might involve categorizing the types of questions or concepts that prove challenging for our approach. Second, we could investigate whether certain steps in our process (e.g., concept extraction, relational mapping) are more predictive of overall uncertainty than others. This could lead to a simplified version of our method that focuses on the most informative steps. Third, we could explore combining our approach with existing methods, such as using the conceptual uncertainty scores as features in a machine learning model alongside traditional confidence measures. Finally, we could shift focus to analyze how different types of questions or domains affect the performance of various uncertainty estimation methods, turning the project into a comparative analysis of uncertainty estimation techniques across diverse tasks and knowledge domains."
