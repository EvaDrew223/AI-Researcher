    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Single-perspective uncertainty estimates from LLMs can be biased or incomplete, failing to capture the full range of potential uncertainties in complex scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on a single pass of confidence estimation, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty that might be revealed through deeper examination.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a multi-agent debate focused specifically on sources of uncertainty, we can uncover a more comprehensive and nuanced uncertainty profile.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Cognitive Debate for Uncertainty Quantification, a method that leverages the LLM to simulate a structured debate about its own uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Initiating the debate by asking the model to provide an initial confidence estimate and justification. 2) Prompting the model to take on different personas (e.g., skeptic, optimist, domain expert) and critique the initial estimate, focusing on potential sources of uncertainty. 3) Allowing the original persona to defend and refine its estimate based on these critiques. 4) Iterating this process, with each round focusing on increasingly nuanced aspects of uncertainty. 5) Concluding by prompting the model to synthesize the debate into a final, more comprehensive uncertainty estimate and profile.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on complex, multifaceted problems across various domains. Compare against single-pass confidence elicitation and other uncertainty estimation techniques. Assess both the final uncertainty estimates and the quality of the generated debate in terms of uncovering relevant sources of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Meta-Cognitive Debate for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Single-perspective uncertainty estimates from Large Language Models (LLMs) can be biased or incomplete, failing to capture the full range of potential uncertainties in complex scenarios. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs, especially in high-stakes decision-making contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods typically rely on a single pass of confidence estimation, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty that might be revealed through deeper examination. By simulating a multi-agent debate focused specifically on sources of uncertainty, we can uncover a more comprehensive and nuanced uncertainty profile. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to consider multiple perspectives and engage in meta-cognitive reasoning, potentially leading to more robust and reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Cognitive Debate for Uncertainty Quantification, a method that leverages the LLM to simulate a structured debate about its own uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Initiating the debate by asking the model to provide an initial confidence estimate and justification. 2) Prompting the model to take on different personas (e.g., skeptic, optimist, domain expert) and critique the initial estimate, focusing on potential sources of uncertainty. 3) Allowing the original persona to defend and refine its estimate based on these critiques. 4) Iterating this process, with each round focusing on increasingly nuanced aspects of uncertainty. 5) Concluding by prompting the model to synthesize the debate into a final, more comprehensive uncertainty estimate and profile.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover a range of domains and complexity levels: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, and 3) BIG-bench's Logical Deduction task for abstract reasoning. These datasets will be preprocessed to include only questions without ground truth answers, as we're focusing on uncertainty estimation rather than answer accuracy.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: simply ask the model to provide a confidence score and explanation. 2) Ensemble method: use multiple model calls with different temperatures and calculate the variance of outputs. 3) Monte Carlo Dropout: if using an open-source model, apply MC Dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Meta-Cognitive Debate Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial estimate generation, b) Persona-based critiques, c) Defense and refinement, d) Iteration, e) Final synthesis. We'll use few-shot prompting with carefully designed examples to guide the model through each step.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and our proposed method), we'll run the uncertainty estimation process on a subset of 100 questions. We'll use GPT-4 as our primary model, with GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude 2 as secondary models for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We'll evaluate the methods based on: 1) Comprehensiveness: assess the range and depth of uncertainty sources identified. 2) Consistency: compare uncertainty estimates across multiple runs. 3) Calibration: on a held-out set of questions with known answers, compare estimated uncertainty with actual performance. 4) Human evaluation: have domain experts rate the quality and plausibility of the uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of uncertainty profiles across methods. 2) Identification of common patterns or blind spots in uncertainty estimation. 3) Analysis of how different personas contribute to the final uncertainty estimate. 4) Investigation of how the number of debate rounds affects the final estimate."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer along with a confidence score from 0 to 100 and a brief explanation for your confidence level.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98/100. Explanation: I'm highly confident in this answer as it's a well-known fact that Paris is the capital of France. This information is widely taught and rarely changes. The only slight uncertainty comes from the possibility of very recent, unlikely geopolitical changes that I might not be aware of.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Meta-Cognitive Debate; Initial Estimate)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your initial answer, confidence score (0-100), and a brief explanation for your confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Meta-Cognitive Debate; Initial Estimate)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98/100. Explanation: This is a well-established fact that has remained constant for centuries. Paris has been the political and cultural center of France for a long time, and there's no recent information suggesting any change to this status.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Meta-Cognitive Debate; Skeptic Critique)": "Now, take on the role of a skeptic. What potential sources of uncertainty or doubt could be raised about the initial confidence estimate?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Meta-Cognitive Debate; Skeptic Critique)": "As a skeptic, I would raise the following points:\n1. Historical changes: Capitals can change. For example, the capital of Brazil moved from Rio de Janeiro to Bras\u00edlia in 1960.\n2. Definition ambiguity: 'Capital' could refer to the administrative capital, legislative capital, or economic center, which aren't always the same city.\n3. Recent events: There could be very recent geopolitical changes that haven't been widely reported yet.\n4. Model knowledge cutoff: If the model's training data has a cutoff date, it might not be aware of recent changes.\n5. Linguistic ambiguity: In some contexts, 'France' might refer to historical regions or entities different from the modern nation-state.\nThese factors suggest that a 98% confidence level might be slightly overconfident.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Meta-Cognitive Debate; Defense and Refinement)": "Consider the skeptic's critique. How would you defend or refine your initial estimate?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Meta-Cognitive Debate; Defense and Refinement)": "After considering the skeptic's points, I would refine my estimate as follows:\nRevised confidence score: 95/100\nExplanation: The skeptic raises valid points that slightly reduce my confidence:\n1. While capital changes are possible, they're extremely rare for stable, developed nations like France. The last time France's capital changed was in 987 CE when it moved from Laon to Paris.\n2. Paris is unambiguously the administrative, legislative, and de facto economic capital of France, addressing the definition concern.\n3-4. Recent unannounced changes or limitations in my knowledge are possible but highly unlikely for such a fundamental fact.\n5. In modern context, 'France' almost always refers to the current nation-state.\nHowever, to account for these small uncertainties, I've reduced my confidence slightly to 95%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Meta-Cognitive Debate; Final Synthesis)": "Based on the initial estimate, critique, and refinement, please provide a final synthesized uncertainty estimate and profile for the question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Meta-Cognitive Debate; Final Synthesis)": "Final Uncertainty Estimate and Profile:\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\nConfidence Score: 95/100\nUncertainty Profile:\n1. Historical Stability: Very low uncertainty. Paris has been the capital since 987 CE, providing over a millennium of stability.\n2. Definition Clarity: Low uncertainty. Paris serves as the administrative, legislative, and economic capital, reducing ambiguity.\n3. Recent Changes: Very low uncertainty, but not zero. While highly unlikely, there's a minimal chance of very recent, unreported changes.\n4. Knowledge Limitations: Very low uncertainty. This is such a fundamental fact that it's unlikely to be affected by knowledge cutoffs or missing recent information.\n5. Contextual Interpretation: Very low uncertainty. In modern discourse, 'France' almost always refers to the current nation-state.\n6. Geopolitical Stability: Very low uncertainty. France is a stable, developed nation where sudden capital changes are extremely unlikely.\nConclusion: While we maintain a high confidence level of 95%, this debate process has highlighted that even for seemingly certain facts, there are nuanced sources of potential uncertainty. This more comprehensive uncertainty profile provides a clearer picture of where the small amounts of doubt originate, allowing for more informed decision-making based on this information.",
            "explanation": "The Meta-Cognitive Debate method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive uncertainty profile compared to the baseline method. It identifies specific sources of uncertainty, quantifies them, and provides a reasoned synthesis. This approach not only gives a more justified confidence score but also offers insights into the nature of the uncertainty, which can be crucial for decision-making processes."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Meta-Cognitive Debate method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the debate process itself, examining how different personas contribute to the uncertainty estimation and whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from this approach. This could lead to insights about the strengths and limitations of LLMs in meta-cognitive reasoning. Second, we could explore hybrid approaches that combine our method with traditional uncertainty quantification techniques, potentially leveraging the strengths of both. Third, we could focus on using the debate process to generate explanations for uncertainty, even if the quantitative estimates aren't significantly improved. This could turn the project into an explainable AI study, where we analyze the quality and usefulness of the generated explanations for understanding model uncertainty. Lastly, we could investigate how the debate process itself might be used as a fine-tuning approach to improve the model's inherent ability to estimate uncertainty, potentially leading to a new training paradigm for more calibrated language models."
