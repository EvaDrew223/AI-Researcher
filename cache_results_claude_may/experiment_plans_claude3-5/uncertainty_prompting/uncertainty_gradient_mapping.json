    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different domains and tasks, leading to overconfident predictions in areas of low knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods provide coarse-grained uncertainty estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by gradient descent in optimization, we can iteratively probe the model's knowledge boundaries to map out fine-grained uncertainty landscapes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Gradient Mapping (UGM), which iteratively perturbs input prompts along semantic dimensions to trace out uncertainty gradients. The process starts with a base prompt and systematically varies key elements (e.g., entities, relations, contexts) while tracking changes in the model's expressed confidence. This creates a high-dimensional uncertainty map that captures subtle variations in model certainty. The prompt perturbations are generated using techniques like word substitution, entity swapping, and context shifting. At each step, we prompt the model to provide both an answer and an explicit confidence score. By aggregating these confidence scores across the semantic neighborhood of the original prompt, we can construct detailed uncertainty landscapes that highlight areas of high and low model confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UGM against baselines like temperature scaling and Monte Carlo dropout on benchmark datasets spanning multiple domains (e.g., commonsense reasoning, factual QA). We'll measure calibration metrics like expected calibration error, as well as the granularity and interpretability of the uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Gradient Mapping: Fine-Grained Confidence Calibration for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different domains and tasks, leading to overconfident predictions in areas of low knowledge. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications like healthcare or legal advice.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods provide only coarse-grained uncertainty estimates. These methods often lack the granularity needed to capture subtle variations in model confidence across different aspects of a given task or domain. Inspired by gradient descent in optimization, we propose to iteratively probe the model's knowledge boundaries to map out fine-grained uncertainty landscapes. This approach allows us to capture nuanced variations in model certainty, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Gradient Mapping (UGM), which iteratively perturbs input prompts along semantic dimensions to trace out uncertainty gradients. The process starts with a base prompt and systematically varies key elements (e.g., entities, relations, contexts) while tracking changes in the model's expressed confidence.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets spanning different domains: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and (3) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning. These datasets cover a range of tasks where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature values (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) to calibrate model outputs. (2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Perform 10 forward passes with dropout enabled and use the variance of the outputs as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: UGM Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Gradient Mapping method with the following steps: (a) For each input prompt, generate 10 perturbed versions using techniques like word substitution, entity swapping, and context shifting. (b) For each perturbed prompt, query the model to get both an answer and a confidence score. (c) Aggregate the confidence scores to create an uncertainty landscape for the original prompt.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the UGM process: (1) Base prompt: 'Question: {question} Answer: ' (2) Confidence elicitation: 'On a scale of 0 to 100, how confident are you in your answer?' (3) Perturbed prompt: 'Consider a slightly different scenario: {perturbed_question} Answer: '",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the uncertainty estimates: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (2) Brier Score, (3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. (b) Run the UGM method and collect results. (c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and UGM methods.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of UGM against the baselines across different datasets and models. Analyze the granularity and interpretability of the uncertainty estimates produced by UGM."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Question: What is the capital of France? Answer:",
                "Output (Temperature Scaling, T=1.0)": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "Temperature scaling provides a single confidence score for the entire answer, lacking granularity in uncertainty estimation."
            },
            "UGM Example": {
                "Input": "Question: What is the capital of France? Answer:",
                "Output": "The capital of France is Paris. Uncertainty Landscape: {City: 5%, Country: 2%, Function: 3%, Overall: 3%}",
                "Explanation": "UGM provides a more detailed uncertainty landscape, breaking down confidence levels for different aspects of the answer (city, country, and function as capital). This granular information allows for better understanding of the model's certainty in different parts of its knowledge."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UGM method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration metrics, we can pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of uncertainty patterns across different types of questions and knowledge domains. We could investigate how the granularity of UGM reveals interesting patterns in model uncertainty that are not captured by traditional methods. This could involve clustering questions based on their uncertainty landscapes and analyzing how these clusters relate to question difficulty, domain specificity, or other factors. Additionally, we could explore how UGM can be used to identify specific knowledge gaps or inconsistencies in the model's training data, potentially providing insights for targeted model improvements or dataset curation."
