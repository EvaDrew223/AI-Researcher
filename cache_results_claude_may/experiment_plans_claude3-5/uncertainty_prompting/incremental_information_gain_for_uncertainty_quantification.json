    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLM uncertainty quantification methods often struggle to accurately reflect how additional information impacts confidence levels.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches include token probability analysis, ensemble methods, and calibration through fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often assess their confidence by considering how much additional information would be needed to increase certainty. By simulating this process in LLMs, we may achieve more accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce 'Incremental Information Gain' (IIG), a multi-step prompting strategy. Given a query, we first prompt the LLM to provide an initial answer and confidence score. We then prompt it to generate a series of hypothetical pieces of additional information, each time reassessing its confidence. This process continues until the model either reaches high confidence or determines that no reasonable amount of additional information would significantly increase confidence. We also incorporate an 'information relevance' step, where the model is asked to explain why each piece of information is or isn't helpful, potentially leading to more nuanced confidence updates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare IIG against baseline methods on a variety of tasks, including open-ended questions, multi-hop reasoning problems, and research-oriented queries. Evaluate using calibration metrics like ECE and Brier score. Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated additional information through human evaluation. Test the method's ability to maintain appropriate uncertainty in scenarios where insufficient information is available to reach high confidence."

        "Title": "Incremental Information Gain: A Multi-Step Prompting Strategy for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately reflect how additional information impacts confidence levels. This limitation hinders the models' ability to provide reliable confidence estimates, especially in scenarios where information availability varies.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like token probability analysis, ensemble methods, and calibration through fine-tuning have shown limited success in accurately quantifying uncertainty. Human experts, on the other hand, often assess their confidence by considering how much additional information would be needed to increase certainty. By simulating this process in LLMs, we aim to achieve more accurate and nuanced uncertainty quantification. The Incremental Information Gain (IIG) method proposed here leverages the LLM's ability to generate hypothetical information and reassess its confidence, potentially leading to more reliable uncertainty estimates across various tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Incremental Information Gain (IIG), a multi-step prompting strategy. Given a query, we first prompt the LLM to provide an initial answer and confidence score. We then prompt it to generate a series of hypothetical pieces of additional information, each time reassessing its confidence. This process continues until the model either reaches high confidence or determines that no reasonable amount of additional information would significantly increase confidence. We also incorporate an 'information relevance' step, where the model is asked to explain why each piece of information is or isn't helpful, potentially leading to more nuanced confidence updates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: (1) TruthfulQA for open-ended questions, (2) HotpotQA for multi-hop reasoning problems, and (3) SciQ for research-oriented queries. These datasets cover a range of question types and difficulty levels, allowing us to assess the method's performance across different scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, (2) Ensemble method using multiple model runs, and (3) Temperature scaling for calibration. For each baseline, we'll use the same LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) and prompt it to provide an answer along with a confidence score.",
            "Step 3: IIG Implementation": "Implement the IIG method with the following steps: (a) Initial answer and confidence generation, (b) Hypothetical information generation, (c) Confidence reassessment, (d) Information relevance explanation, and (e) Final answer and confidence output. We'll use few-shot prompting to guide the model through these steps.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and IIG), we'll run the following process: (1) Input each question to the model, (2) Collect the answer and confidence score(s), (3) For IIG, record all intermediate steps (generated information, reassessed confidences, and relevance explanations), (4) Repeat this process for all questions in the dataset.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (2) Brier score, (3) Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic curve (AUCE), and (4) Accuracy of final answers. Additionally, we'll conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated additional information and relevance explanations.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis, including: (1) Comparison of calibration curves for all methods, (2) Analysis of how confidence changes with each piece of additional information in IIG, (3) Examination of cases where IIG significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines, and (4) Investigation of the relationship between information relevance explanations and confidence updates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a direct answer with a high confidence score, but doesn't show the reasoning process or consider additional information."
            },
            "IIG Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your initial answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1. Then, generate a piece of additional information that could increase your confidence, reassess your confidence, and explain why the information is relevant or not. Repeat this process up to 3 times or until you reach a confidence of 0.99.",
                "Output": "Initial answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.95\n\nAdditional information 1: France is a country in Western Europe.\nReassessed confidence: 0.96\nRelevance explanation: This information confirms that we're talking about the correct country, but doesn't directly support Paris as the capital.\n\nAdditional information 2: The Eiffel Tower, a famous landmark, is located in Paris.\nReassessed confidence: 0.98\nRelevance explanation: This information strongly supports Paris as the capital, as major landmarks are often found in capital cities.\n\nAdditional information 3: Paris is the seat of the French government and home to the President's residence, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\nReassessed confidence: 0.99\nRelevance explanation: This information directly confirms Paris's status as the capital by mentioning its role in the country's governance.\n\nFinal answer: The capital of France is Paris. Final confidence score: 0.99",
                "Explanation": "The IIG method shows a step-by-step process of generating relevant information and reassessing confidence. It provides a more nuanced and transparent approach to confidence estimation."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the IIG method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We'll examine the quality and relevance of the generated additional information, analyzing whether it truly contributes to increased certainty. We can also investigate how different types of questions or domains affect the method's performance. Additionally, we could explore variations of the IIG method, such as allowing the model to 'search' for specific types of information or incorporating a meta-learning component where the model learns to generate more effective additional information over time. Another direction could be to combine IIG with other uncertainty quantification methods, creating a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple techniques."
