    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often provide overly confident answers even when their knowledge is incomplete or uncertain across different semantic aspects of a question.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically treat uncertainty as a single scalar value, failing to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty across different semantic components of a question.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how humans break down complex questions into simpler components to assess their knowledge, we propose a method to map uncertainty across different semantic aspects of a question.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Mapping (SDUM), a structured prompting technique. First, we prompt the model to decompose the question into its key semantic components (e.g., entities, relationships, temporal aspects). Then, for each component, we ask the model to provide a confidence estimate and explain the reasoning behind it. We use prompts like \"Identify the key semantic components of this question\" and \"For each component, provide a confidence estimate and explain your reasoning\". Finally, we prompt the model to synthesize these component-level uncertainties into an overall uncertainty map and final answer. This approach provides a granular view of the model's uncertainty across different aspects of the question.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SDUM against standard uncertainty quantification methods on complex question-answering datasets like HotpotQA and ComplexWebQuestions, evaluating both answer quality and the granularity and accuracy of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Mapping (SDUM): Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide overly confident answers even when their knowledge is incomplete or uncertain across different semantic aspects of a question. Existing approaches typically treat uncertainty as a single scalar value, failing to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty across different semantic components of a question.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how humans break down complex questions into simpler components to assess their knowledge, we propose a method to map uncertainty across different semantic aspects of a question. This approach aims to provide a more granular and accurate representation of model uncertainty, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates and more reliable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Mapping (SDUM), a structured prompting technique. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Semantic decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the question into key semantic components. 2) Component-wise uncertainty estimation: For each component, ask the model to provide a confidence estimate and explain its reasoning. 3) Uncertainty synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize component-level uncertainties into an overall uncertainty map and final answer.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use complex question-answering datasets like HotpotQA and ComplexWebQuestions. These datasets contain multi-hop reasoning questions that are suitable for semantic decomposition.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods: a) Direct answer with confidence score. b) Monte Carlo Dropout. c) Ensemble of models. d) Temperature scaling.",
            "Step 3: SDUM Implementation": "Implement the SDUM method using the following prompts: a) Semantic decomposition: \"Identify the key semantic components of this question: [QUESTION]\". b) Component-wise uncertainty: \"For each component, provide a confidence estimate (0-100%) and explain your reasoning:\". c) Uncertainty synthesis: \"Based on the component-level uncertainties, provide an overall uncertainty map and final answer for the question: [QUESTION]\".",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Answer quality: Exact Match (EM) and F1 score. b) Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). c) Uncertainty quality: Brier score and AUROC for detecting unanswerable questions.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results. b) Run SDUM method and collect results. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and SDUM results.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare SDUM performance against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze the quality and relevance of semantic decompositions. c) Examine the correlation between component-level uncertainties and overall uncertainty. d) Investigate cases where SDUM significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Question: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title?",
                "Output": "The director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2003, the same year Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title, was Peter Jackson for 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. Confidence: 95%"
            },
            "SDUM Example": {
                "Input": "Question: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title?",
                "Semantic Decomposition": "1. Year Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title\n2. Academy Award for Best Picture winner in that year\n3. Director of the winning film",
                "Component-wise Uncertainty": "1. Year of Federer's first Wimbledon title: 90% confident. Reasoning: Federer is a well-known tennis player, and his first Wimbledon win was a significant milestone in his career.\n2. Best Picture winner that year: 80% confident. Reasoning: While I know major Oscar winners, there's a chance I might confuse years.\n3. Director of the winning film: 85% confident. Reasoning: Directors of Best Picture winners are usually well-known, but there's a small chance of misremembering.",
                "Uncertainty Synthesis": "Overall uncertainty map: The main source of uncertainty is in identifying the correct Best Picture winner for the specific year. The confidence in Federer's first Wimbledon year is high, which anchors the other components. Final answer: Peter Jackson, director of 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King', which won Best Picture in 2003 when Federer won his first Wimbledon. Overall confidence: 85%"
            },
            "Explanation": "The SDUM method provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty across different aspects of the question. It identifies that the main source of uncertainty is in matching the Best Picture winner to the specific year, which allows for a more accurate overall confidence estimate. This granular approach can help in identifying potential errors and providing more reliable answers."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SDUM does not significantly improve performance over baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of why the method falls short. This could involve: 1) Analyzing the quality and consistency of semantic decompositions across different question types. 2) Investigating whether the component-wise uncertainty estimates are accurate and informative. 3) Examining if the synthesis step effectively combines component uncertainties. 4) Comparing the types of errors made by SDUM versus baseline methods to identify potential areas for improvement. We could also explore variations of SDUM, such as using different prompting strategies for decomposition or uncertainty estimation, or incorporating external knowledge sources to improve component-wise confidence estimates. Additionally, we could investigate how SDUM performs on different types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights on when semantic decomposition is most beneficial for uncertainty estimation."
