        "Problem": "LLMs struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when faced with complex, multifaceted problems that require considering multiple perspectives or domains of knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods often rely on single-perspective confidence estimation or simple ensemble techniques that don't fully capture the nuanced interplay between different viewpoints.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often assess their confidence by considering a problem from multiple angles or consulting with colleagues from different disciplines. Mimicking this process could lead to more robust and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Perspectival Confidence Triangulation (PCT), a prompting technique that simulates a multi-expert panel discussion to refine confidence estimates. The process involves: (1) Perspective Generation: Prompt the LLM to identify 3-5 relevant perspectives or domains of expertise for the given problem. (2) Expert Simulation: For each perspective, prompt the LLM to role-play as an expert from that domain, providing an answer and confidence score. (3) Cross-Examination: Prompt each 'expert' to question and critique the others' responses. (4) Confidence Refinement: Based on the simulated discussion, prompt the LLM to synthesize a final answer and calibrated confidence score. The prompts should encourage the model to explicitly reason about how different perspectives influence overall confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare PCT against single-perspective and standard ensemble methods on multidisciplinary datasets (e.g., complex reasoning tasks, interdisciplinary scientific problems). Evaluate not only the final confidence calibration but also the quality and diversity of the simulated expert discussions."

        "Title": "Perspectival Confidence Triangulation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when faced with complex, multifaceted problems that require considering multiple perspectives or domains of knowledge. This limitation can lead to overconfident or poorly calibrated responses in scenarios where nuanced understanding is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-perspective confidence estimation or simple ensemble techniques that don't fully capture the nuanced interplay between different viewpoints. Human experts, on the other hand, often assess their confidence by considering a problem from multiple angles or consulting with colleagues from different disciplines. By mimicking this process, we aim to develop a more robust and well-calibrated uncertainty estimation method for LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Perspectival Confidence Triangulation (PCT), a prompting technique that simulates a multi-expert panel discussion to refine confidence estimates. The process involves four main steps: (1) Perspective Generation: Prompt the LLM to identify 3-5 relevant perspectives or domains of expertise for the given problem. (2) Expert Simulation: For each perspective, prompt the LLM to role-play as an expert from that domain, providing an answer and confidence score. (3) Cross-Examination: Prompt each 'expert' to question and critique the others' responses. (4) Confidence Refinement: Based on the simulated discussion, prompt the LLM to synthesize a final answer and calibrated confidence score. The prompts should encourage the model to explicitly reason about how different perspectives influence overall confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require multidisciplinary knowledge and complex reasoning: (1) AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) for scientific reasoning, (2) TruthfulQA for assessing truthful and unbiased responses, and (3) MultiArith for multi-step arithmetic reasoning. These datasets will be split into training (for few-shot examples), validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation, and (3) Ensemble method using multiple independent runs.",
            "Step 3: PCT Implementation": "Implement the Perspectival Confidence Triangulation method with the following sub-steps: (a) Perspective Generation, (b) Expert Simulation, (c) Cross-Examination, and (d) Confidence Refinement.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: (1) Accuracy of the final answers, (2) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), (3) Brier score, and (4) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and PCT. For each method, we'll use a few-shot setting with 3-5 examples.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of PCT against baselines across all metrics. Analyze the quality and diversity of the simulated expert discussions. Investigate how the number of perspectives affects performance.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing or modifying each step of PCT to understand the contribution of each component."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: A pendulum's period is proportional to the square root of its length. If a pendulum with a length of 1 meter has a period of 2 seconds, what would be the period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Answer: The period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters would be 4 seconds. Confidence: 90%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PCT; Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "Q: A pendulum's period is proportional to the square root of its length. If a pendulum with a length of 1 meter has a period of 2 seconds, what would be the period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters? Please identify 3-5 relevant perspectives or domains of expertise that would be helpful in answering this question accurately.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PCT; Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "1. Physics: Understanding of pendulum motion and the mathematical relationship between length and period.\n2. Mathematics: Ability to work with proportions, square roots, and algebraic equations.\n3. Experimental Physics: Knowledge of how to set up and measure pendulum experiments accurately.\n4. Error Analysis: Understanding of potential sources of error in measurements and calculations.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PCT; Step 2: Expert Simulation)": "Now, for each perspective, provide an answer to the question and a confidence level (0-100%) as if you were an expert in that field.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PCT; Step 2: Expert Simulation)": "Physics Expert: The period is proportional to the square root of length, so if we quadruple the length, the period will double. The new period would be 4 seconds. Confidence: 95%\n\nMathematics Expert: Let's use the proportion T1/T2 = \u221a(L1/L2). We have T1=2, L1=1, L2=4. Solving for T2, we get T2 = 2 * \u221a(4/1) = 2 * 2 = 4 seconds. Confidence: 98%\n\nExperimental Physics Expert: Based on the given information and typical pendulum behavior, the period should be 4 seconds. However, real-world factors like air resistance might slightly affect this. Confidence: 90%\n\nError Analysis Expert: The theoretical answer is 4 seconds, but we should consider potential measurement errors in the original pendulum's length and period. A more conservative estimate would be 4 \u00b1 0.1 seconds. Confidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PCT; Step 3: Cross-Examination)": "Now, have each expert briefly critique or question the responses of the others.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PCT; Step 3: Cross-Examination)": "Physics Expert: The Mathematics Expert's approach is sound, but they might want to mention the assumptions behind the simple pendulum equation. The Experimental Physics Expert raises a good point about real-world factors, but at these lengths, air resistance is likely negligible.\n\nMathematics Expert: I agree with the Physics Expert's intuitive explanation. The Error Analysis Expert's range is reasonable, but we might want to clarify if the original measurements were assumed to be exact or had their own error margins.\n\nExperimental Physics Expert: The theoretical approaches of the Physics and Mathematics Experts are correct. I appreciate the Error Analysis Expert's consideration of uncertainties, but we might need more information about the measurement precision to justify that specific error range.\n\nError Analysis Expert: All experts have valid points. I'd suggest that in future, we explicitly state assumptions about ideal conditions and measurement precision. This would help reconcile the slight differences in our confidence levels.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PCT; Step 4: Confidence Refinement)": "Based on the expert responses and cross-examination, provide a final answer to the original question and a calibrated confidence level (0-100%). Explain how you arrived at this confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PCT; Step 4: Confidence Refinement)": "Final Answer: The period of a pendulum with a length of 4 meters would be 4 seconds, assuming ideal conditions.\n\nCalibrated Confidence: 92%\n\nExplanation: The high confidence (92%) is based on the strong agreement among experts on the theoretical result of 4 seconds. The slight reduction from the highest individual confidence (98%) accounts for the valid points raised about real-world factors and potential measurement errors. While these factors are likely minimal for the given pendulum lengths, they introduce a small degree of uncertainty. The cross-examination process highlighted the importance of stating assumptions clearly, which has been incorporated into the final answer. This calibrated confidence reflects a balance between the strong theoretical foundation and the acknowledgment of minor real-world considerations.",
            "explanation": "PCT improves upon the baseline by considering multiple perspectives, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the problem and potential sources of uncertainty. The cross-examination step helps identify and address potential weaknesses in each expert's reasoning. The final confidence refinement step synthesizes these insights into a well-calibrated confidence estimate, which is likely more reliable than the single-perspective estimate from the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PCT doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated perspectives to understand if the model is consistently identifying relevant domains of expertise. This could lead to insights about the model's meta-knowledge and ability to decompose problems. 2) Investigate the quality of simulated expert responses and cross-examinations. Are they genuinely providing diverse viewpoints, or are they largely redundant? This analysis could inform improved prompting strategies or reveal limitations in the model's ability to simulate diverse expertise. 3) Examine cases where PCT performs worse than baselines. Are there specific types of questions or domains where multiple perspectives lead to confusion rather than clarity? This could lead to a more nuanced understanding of when and how to apply multi-perspective reasoning. 4) Explore alternative ways of aggregating expert opinions, such as weighted averaging based on the perceived relevance of each expert's domain to the specific question. 5) Investigate how the number of perspectives affects performance, which could lead to insights about the optimal complexity of the prompting strategy for different types of questions. These analyses could transform the project into an insightful study on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in simulating expert discussions and meta-cognitive processes."
