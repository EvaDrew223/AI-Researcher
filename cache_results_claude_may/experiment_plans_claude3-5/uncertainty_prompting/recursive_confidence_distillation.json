        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, often exhibiting overconfidence in incorrect answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or basic self-reflection techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often refine their confidence through iterative self-questioning and considering alternative viewpoints. We can mimic this process in LLMs to achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Confidence Distillation (RCD), a multi-step prompting technique that iteratively refines confidence estimates. The process begins with an initial response and confidence estimate. In each subsequent step, we prompt the model to: (1) Generate potential flaws or oversights in its previous reasoning, (2) Propose alternative viewpoints or interpretations, (3) Re-evaluate its confidence based on these new considerations, and (4) Provide a rationale for any changes in confidence. This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes. The final confidence estimate is derived from the trajectory of these iterative refinements, potentially using techniques like exponential smoothing or Bayesian updating.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RCD against standard confidence elicitation and single-pass self-reflection techniques on diverse tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and multi-step problem-solving. Evaluate using calibration metrics, Brier scores, and human expert judgments of confidence accuracy."

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Distillation: Iterative Self-Reflection for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, frequently exhibiting overconfidence in incorrect answers. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, limiting the practical applications of LLMs in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or basic self-reflection techniques. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced process of human confidence assessment, which involves iterative self-questioning and consideration of alternative viewpoints. By mimicking this iterative process in LLMs, we aim to achieve more accurate and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our proposed method, Recursive Confidence Distillation (RCD), is inspired by human metacognition and seeks to leverage the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to refine its confidence estimates through multiple rounds of self-reflection.",
        "Proposed Method": "Recursive Confidence Distillation (RCD) is a multi-step prompting technique that iteratively refines confidence estimates. The process begins with an initial response and confidence estimate. In each subsequent step, we prompt the model to: (1) Generate potential flaws or oversights in its previous reasoning, (2) Propose alternative viewpoints or interpretations, (3) Re-evaluate its confidence based on these new considerations, and (4) Provide a rationale for any changes in confidence. This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until confidence stabilizes. The final confidence estimate is derived from the trajectory of these iterative refinements, using techniques like exponential smoothing or Bayesian updating.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate RCD: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) GSM8K for multi-step mathematical problem-solving. These datasets cover a range of task types and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, (2) Single-pass self-reflection, and (3) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models). For each baseline, we'll use a prompt template that asks the model to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100%).",
            "Step 3: RCD Implementation": "Implement the RCD method with the following steps: (a) Initial response and confidence estimation, (b) Flaw identification, (c) Alternative viewpoint generation, (d) Confidence re-evaluation, and (e) Rationale provision. Repeat steps b-e for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 3-5) or until confidence change is below a threshold.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our main experiments. Additionally, we'll use the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparisons and to implement Monte Carlo Dropout baseline.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Run all baseline methods and record answers and confidence scores, (b) Run RCD method and record intermediate and final confidence scores along with rationales, (c) Collect human expert judgments on a subset of examples to assess the quality of confidence estimates.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: (a) Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), (b) Brier scores, (c) Spearman rank correlation between model confidence and human expert judgments, and (d) Qualitative analysis of confidence trajectories and rationales.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis including: (a) Comparison of RCD performance across different task types, (b) Analysis of confidence trajectories to identify patterns of over/under-confidence, (c) Investigation of the impact of iteration count on performance, and (d) Examination of generated flaws and alternative viewpoints for insights into model reasoning."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer as a percentage between 0 and 100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your initial confidence in the answer as a percentage between 0 and 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD Step 2: Flaw Identification)": "Given your previous answer that the capital of France is Paris with 98% confidence, what potential flaws or oversights might exist in your reasoning?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD Step 2: Flaw Identification)": "Potential flaws in my reasoning:\n1. I didn't consider historical changes in capitals.\n2. I assumed the question refers to the current capital, not a past or future one.\n3. I didn't account for potential trick questions or ambiguities in the definition of 'capital'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD Step 3: Alternative Viewpoints)": "What alternative interpretations or answers could be considered for the question 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD Step 3: Alternative Viewpoints)": "Alternative interpretations or answers:\n1. Versailles could be considered a historical capital of France.\n2. Some might argue that Brussels, as the de facto capital of the European Union, could be seen as a 'capital' for France in certain contexts.\n3. In terms of economic or cultural significance, other cities like Lyon or Marseille might be considered 'capitals' in their own right.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD Step 4: Confidence Re-evaluation)": "Based on the flaws and alternative viewpoints identified, re-evaluate your confidence in the answer 'Paris' as the capital of France. Provide your updated confidence as a percentage and explain any changes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD Step 4: Confidence Re-evaluation)": "Updated confidence: 95%\nExplanation: While Paris remains the correct answer in the most common interpretation of the question, the identified potential flaws and alternative viewpoints slightly reduce my confidence. The possibility of historical changes or alternative interpretations of 'capital' introduces a small degree of uncertainty, hence the slight reduction in confidence from 98% to 95%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD Final Step)": "Provide your final answer and confidence for the question 'What is the capital of France?' based on all previous reflections.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD Final Step)": "Final answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nFinal confidence: 95%\nRationale: After considering potential flaws in reasoning and alternative viewpoints, Paris remains the most accurate answer as the current, officially recognized capital of France. The slight reduction in confidence from the initial 98% to 95% reflects an acknowledgment of potential ambiguities or historical nuances, but maintains high confidence in the standard interpretation of the question.",
            "Explanation": "The RCD method demonstrates a more nuanced approach to confidence estimation. While the baseline method provides a high confidence score without reflection, RCD encourages the model to consider potential flaws, alternative viewpoints, and refine its confidence accordingly. This process leads to a slightly lower but potentially more calibrated confidence score, accompanied by a detailed rationale that showcases the model's reasoning process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RCD method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the intermediate steps in RCD to understand where the method falls short. This could involve examining the quality and relevance of generated flaws and alternative viewpoints, as well as analyzing patterns in confidence trajectories across different question types. We might discover that RCD is more effective for certain types of questions or reasoning tasks, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. Additionally, we could explore variations of RCD, such as incorporating external knowledge sources at each iteration or experimenting with different prompting strategies for flaw identification and alternative viewpoint generation. Another direction could be to combine RCD with other uncertainty quantification methods, like ensemble techniques or calibration via post-processing, to create a hybrid approach. Finally, if the method consistently fails to improve calibration, we could refocus the project on analyzing why LLMs struggle with self-reflection and confidence estimation, potentially uncovering insights about the limitations of current language models in metacognitive tasks."
