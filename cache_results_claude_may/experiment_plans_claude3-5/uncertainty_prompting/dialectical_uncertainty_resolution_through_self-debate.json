        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately gauge their own uncertainty, particularly for complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid perspectives exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include ensemble methods, calibrated softmax outputs, and direct prompting for confidence scores.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from philosophical dialectics and adversarial training, we propose that engaging an LLM in structured self-debate can lead to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dialectical Uncertainty Resolution through Self-Debate (DURSD). For a given query, the LLM is prompted to generate multiple conflicting viewpoints or answers. It then engages in a multi-turn debate, with each turn involving: (1) Argument generation for each viewpoint, (2) Critique of opposing arguments, (3) Synthesis of new insights. After several rounds, the LLM is prompted to provide a final answer along with a structured uncertainty assessment, detailing areas of confidence and doubt based on the debate process. The intensity and persistence of disagreements throughout the debate serve as key indicators of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate DURSD against standard uncertainty quantification methods on tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as ethical dilemmas, scientific hypothesis evaluation, and legal case analysis. Measure performance using metrics like calibration error, resolution, and correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings."

        "Title": "Dialectical Uncertainty Resolution through Self-Debate: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately gauge their own uncertainty, particularly for complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid perspectives exist. This leads to overconfidence in incorrect answers and underconfidence in correct ones, reducing the reliability and interpretability of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as ensemble methods, calibrated softmax outputs, and direct prompting for confidence scores, often fail to capture the nuanced reasoning process behind complex decisions. Drawing inspiration from philosophical dialectics and adversarial training, we propose that engaging an LLM in structured self-debate can lead to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates. By forcing the model to consider multiple viewpoints and critique its own arguments, we aim to better align the model's expressed confidence with its actual knowledge and reasoning capabilities.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that require complex reasoning and are prone to uncertainty: (a) Ethical dilemmas from the ETHICS dataset, (b) Scientific hypothesis evaluation tasks from the ScienceQA dataset, (c) Legal case analysis from the LexGLUE benchmark.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods: (a) Direct confidence prompting, (b) Ensemble method using different seeds, (c) Temperature scaling for calibrated softmax outputs.",
            "Step 3: DURSD Implementation": "Develop prompts for each stage of the DURSD process: (a) Initial viewpoint generation, (b) Argument generation, (c) Critique generation, (d) Synthesis, (e) Final answer and uncertainty assessment.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method: (a) Generate answers and uncertainty estimates, (b) Record intermediate outputs for DURSD (debate turns, critiques, etc.).",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Measure performance using: (a) Calibration error, (b) Brier score, (c) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (d) Correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings (recruit domain experts for a subset of examples).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: (a) Compare DURSD performance against baselines, (b) Analyze debate patterns and their correlation with final uncertainty estimates, (c) Investigate cases where DURSD significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: In a trolley problem scenario, is it ethical to divert a runaway trolley from a track with five people to a track with one person?",
                "Direct Confidence Prompting Output": "Answer: Yes, it is ethical to divert the trolley. Confidence: 85%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single answer with a high confidence score, failing to capture the complexity and uncertainty inherent in the ethical dilemma."
            },
            "DURSD Example": {
                "Input": "Q: In a trolley problem scenario, is it ethical to divert a runaway trolley from a track with five people to a track with one person?",
                "Step 1 - Viewpoint Generation": "Viewpoint 1: It is ethical to divert the trolley.\nViewpoint 2: It is not ethical to divert the trolley.",
                "Step 2 - Argument Generation": "Argument for Viewpoint 1: Utilitarianism suggests that saving more lives is the most ethical action.\nArgument for Viewpoint 2: Actively choosing to end someone's life violates the principle of non-maleficence.",
                "Step 3 - Critique": "Critique of Viewpoint 1: This ignores individual rights and treats people as mere numbers.\nCritique of Viewpoint 2: This leads to a worse outcome overall and may be seen as passive harm.",
                "Step 4 - Synthesis": "Both viewpoints have merit. The utilitarian perspective favors saving more lives, while the deontological view emphasizes the moral weight of active harm.",
                "Final Output": "Answer: There is no clear consensus on whether it is ethical to divert the trolley. The decision involves weighing utilitarian considerations against deontological principles.\n\nUncertainty Assessment:\n- High confidence (90%) that this is a complex ethical dilemma without a universally agreed-upon answer.\n- Moderate confidence (70%) in the validity of both utilitarian and deontological arguments presented.\n- Low confidence (30%) in making a definitive ethical judgment either way.\n- Areas of uncertainty include the moral weight of action vs. inaction, the commensurability of lives, and the applicability of thought experiments to real-world ethics.",
                "Explanation": "DURSD captures the complexity of the ethical dilemma by presenting multiple viewpoints, critiquing them, and synthesizing insights. The final uncertainty assessment provides a nuanced view of the model's confidence levels across different aspects of the problem, better reflecting the inherent uncertainty in such ethical questions."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DURSD does not significantly outperform baselines, we will pivot to an in-depth analysis of the debate process itself. We can investigate: (1) The quality and diversity of initial viewpoints generated, (2) The logical consistency of arguments and counter-arguments across debate turns, (3) The model's ability to synthesize new insights from conflicting viewpoints. This analysis could reveal limitations in the model's reasoning capabilities or biases in the debate process. Additionally, we could explore variations of the DURSD method, such as incorporating external knowledge sources at specific debate stages or experimenting with different debate structures (e.g., more turns, different prompt formulations). If these approaches don't yield improvements, we could shift focus to developing a new metric for evaluating the quality of uncertainty estimates in complex reasoning tasks, which could be valuable for future research in this area."
