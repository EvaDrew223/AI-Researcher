        "Title": "Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty Prompting: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models across Time",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately assess their uncertainty when extrapolating knowledge to past or future timeframes, leading to confidently stated anachronisms or unfounded predictions. This issue is particularly problematic in tasks requiring temporal reasoning, where the model's confidence should ideally reflect the reliability of information across different time periods.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically treat all knowledge uniformly, without explicitly accounting for the temporal dimension of information. Drawing inspiration from how humans reason about the reliability of historical accounts or future predictions, we propose a method that explicitly probes the model's ability to reason about knowledge across different time periods. This approach aims to leverage the LLM's inherent capabilities to perform temporal reasoning and self-assessment, potentially leading to more calibrated confidence estimates without requiring extensive retraining or external knowledge bases.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty Prompting (TEUP), a multi-step prompting technique designed to improve LLMs' uncertainty quantification for temporally-dependent queries. The method involves: 1) Temporal Anchoring: Identify the primary time period relevant to the question. 2) Backward/Forward Extrapolation: Prompt the model to reason about the question's subject matter in progressively earlier or later time periods. 3) Consistency Check: Ask the model to identify any inconsistencies or uncertainties that arise during temporal extrapolation. 4) Anachronism Detection: Challenge the model to identify potential anachronisms in its reasoning. 5) Temporal Uncertainty Quantification: Estimate overall uncertainty based on the model's ability to maintain consistent reasoning across time periods. 6) Time-Aware Response: Generate the final answer with explicit acknowledgment of temporal uncertainties and potential limitations in extrapolation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a curated dataset of questions requiring temporal reasoning, spanning historical facts to future predictions. This dataset should include: a) Historical questions with well-established answers. b) Contemporary questions about current events. c) Future-oriented questions about potential developments. d) Questions deliberately designed to induce anachronisms. For each question, include the correct answer and the relevant time period. Source questions from existing datasets like TimeQA and StrategyQA, and create additional custom questions to ensure a balanced representation of temporal categories.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Prompting": "Implement three baseline prompting methods: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the question without any additional context. b) CoT prompting: Append 'Let's think about this step by step' to each question. c) Few-shot prompting: Provide 2-3 examples of questions and answers before the target question. Collect responses from the chosen LLM for each baseline method across the entire dataset.",
            "Step 3: Implement TEUP": "For each question in the dataset, apply the following steps: a) Temporal Anchoring: Prompt: 'What is the primary time period relevant to this question: [QUESTION]?' b) Backward/Forward Extrapolation: Prompt: 'Consider this question in [3 earlier time periods] and [3 later time periods]. How would the answer change, if at all?' c) Consistency Check: Prompt: 'Identify any inconsistencies or uncertainties in your reasoning across these time periods.' d) Anachronism Detection: Prompt: 'Are there any potential anachronisms in the reasoning or answers provided? If so, what are they?' e) Temporal Uncertainty Quantification: Prompt: 'On a scale of 1-10, how certain are you about the answer across different time periods? Explain your rating.' f) Time-Aware Response: Prompt: 'Provide a final answer to the original question, explicitly acknowledging any temporal uncertainties or limitations in your extrapolation.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API as the primary models for evaluation. Additionally, test the method on open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat to assess generalizability.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of answers for questions with known ground truths. b) Calibration: Compare the model's expressed uncertainty with its actual performance. c) Temporal Consistency Score: Develop a new metric to quantify the model's consistency in reasoning across different time periods. d) Anachronism Detection Rate: Measure the model's ability to identify deliberate anachronisms in the test set.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation on a subset of responses to assess: a) The perceived quality and informativeness of TEUP responses compared to baselines. b) The appropriateness of expressed uncertainty in the model's answers. c) The detection of subtle anachronisms or temporal inconsistencies that automated metrics might miss.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: a) Compare TEUP performance against baselines across different question types and time periods. b) Analyze how the model's expressed uncertainty correlates with actual performance and temporal distance from the anchor period. c) Identify patterns in the types of temporal reasoning errors or anachronisms that persist even with TEUP. d) Examine how different models (GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5 vs. open-source models) respond to TEUP, and analyze any significant differences in their temporal reasoning capabilities."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "What was the most popular social media platform in 2005?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "In 2005, the most popular social media platform was MySpace. It was founded in 2003 and quickly gained popularity, becoming the most visited social networking site in the United States by 2006. Facebook, which would later overtake MySpace, was still in its early stages and limited to college students at that time.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEUP; Step 1: Temporal Anchoring)": "What is the primary time period relevant to this question: What was the most popular social media platform in 2005?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEUP; Step 1: Temporal Anchoring)": "The primary time period relevant to this question is 2005.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEUP; Step 2: Backward/Forward Extrapolation)": "Consider this question in 1995, 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2020. How would the answer change, if at all?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEUP; Step 2: Backward/Forward Extrapolation)": "1995: Social media platforms as we know them today didn't exist. The internet was in its early stages of public adoption.\n2000: Early social networking sites like SixDegrees.com and Friendster were emerging, but weren't widely popular.\n2005: MySpace was likely the most popular social media platform.\n2010: Facebook had overtaken MySpace as the most popular social media platform.\n2015: Facebook remained dominant, with newer platforms like Instagram and Snapchat gaining popularity.\n2020: Facebook still had the most users globally, but platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter had significant user bases in different demographics.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEUP; Step 3: Consistency Check)": "Identify any inconsistencies or uncertainties in your reasoning across these time periods.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEUP; Step 3: Consistency Check)": "The main uncertainty lies in the exact timing of transitions between platforms. The rise and fall of platforms can be gradual, and popularity can vary by region or demographic. For instance, while MySpace was likely most popular in 2005, it's possible that other platforms were gaining significant traction. Additionally, the concept of 'social media' itself evolved over time, making direct comparisons across wide time spans challenging.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEUP; Step 4: Anachronism Detection)": "Are there any potential anachronisms in the reasoning or answers provided? If so, what are they?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEUP; Step 4: Anachronism Detection)": "No significant anachronisms were detected in the reasoning. However, it's important to note that the term 'social media' as we understand it today wasn't widely used in the earlier time periods mentioned (1995, 2000). Applying this modern concept to earlier internet platforms might be slightly anachronistic, as they were often referred to as 'online communities' or 'social networking sites' at the time.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEUP; Step 5: Temporal Uncertainty Quantification)": "On a scale of 1-10, how certain are you about the answer across different time periods? Explain your rating.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEUP; Step 5: Temporal Uncertainty Quantification)": "Certainty rating: 7/10\nExplanation: I'm relatively certain about the general trend and major platforms mentioned for each period. However, there are factors that reduce certainty:\n1. Lack of precise user statistics for 2005 specifically.\n2. Potential regional variations in platform popularity.\n3. The evolving definition of 'social media' over time.\n4. Possible existence of niche platforms that were popular but not as well-remembered.\nThe certainty is higher for more recent periods (2010-2020) due to better documentation and personal recollection, but slightly lower for 2005 and earlier periods.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TEUP; Step 6: Time-Aware Response)": "Provide a final answer to the original question, explicitly acknowledging any temporal uncertainties or limitations in your extrapolation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TEUP; Step 6: Time-Aware Response)": "Based on the available information and considering the temporal uncertainties, the most popular social media platform in 2005 was likely MySpace. However, it's important to acknowledge several limitations in this answer:\n1. The concept of 'social media' was still evolving in 2005, and what we now call social media platforms were often termed 'social networking sites' then.\n2. Popularity can vary by region and demographic, and without access to precise user statistics from 2005, there's some uncertainty.\n3. Other platforms like Friendster were also significant at the time, and in some regions or demographics, they might have been more popular.\n4. Facebook, founded in 2004, was rapidly gaining users, especially among college students, but was not yet the global phenomenon it would become.\nGiven these factors, while MySpace is the most likely answer, the certainty of this claim is not absolute, and the social media landscape of 2005 was more complex and regionally varied than a single platform can represent.",
            "explanation": "The TEUP method provides a more nuanced and temporally-aware response compared to the baseline. It explicitly considers the evolution of social media over time, acknowledges uncertainties and potential anachronisms, and provides a final answer that is more calibrated in its confidence. This approach helps mitigate overconfident statements about past events and provides context that was missing in the direct prompting approach."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TEUP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty calibration or reduce anachronisms compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why TEUP fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in temporal reasoning. This could involve categorizing types of temporal reasoning errors and analyzing how they relate to the model's training data or architecture. 2) Explore variations of the TEUP method, such as adjusting the number or nature of extrapolation steps, or experimenting with different prompting strategies for each step. 3) Investigate how TEUP performance varies across different types of questions or time periods, which could lead to a more targeted approach for specific temporal reasoning tasks. 4) Combine TEUP with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 5) If the method shows promise but lacks consistency, we could explore few-shot variations of TEUP, where we provide examples of good temporal reasoning before asking the model to perform TEUP on new questions."
