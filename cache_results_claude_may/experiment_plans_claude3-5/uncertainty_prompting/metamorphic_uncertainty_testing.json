    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often fail to recognize the limitations of their knowledge and express appropriate uncertainty, especially when faced with subtle variations in input that should affect confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically evaluate model uncertainty on a fixed set of test examples without systematically exploring input variations.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by metamorphic testing in software engineering, we propose a method to probe model uncertainty by systematically generating variations of input queries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Uncertainty Testing (MUT), a framework for evaluating and improving model uncertainty estimates. MUT involves defining a set of uncertainty-preserving and uncertainty-altering transformations for input queries. Uncertainty-preserving transformations (e.g., paraphrasing, changing irrelevant details) should not affect the model's confidence, while uncertainty-altering transformations (e.g., removing key information, adding conflicting data) should increase uncertainty. The model is prompted with the original query and its variations, and asked to provide answers and confidence estimates for each. Discrepancies between expected and actual confidence changes are used to calibrate the model's uncertainty estimates. The prompt includes instructions for the model to explain its reasoning about how each transformation affects its confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Apply MUT to a diverse set of question-answering and decision-making tasks. Compare the calibration of uncertainty estimates before and after MUT. Evaluate the method's ability to improve model performance on out-of-distribution and adversarial examples."

        "Title": "Metamorphic Uncertainty Testing: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Systematic Input Variations",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often fail to recognize the limitations of their knowledge and express appropriate uncertainty, especially when faced with subtle variations in input that should affect confidence. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, particularly in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically evaluate model uncertainty on a fixed set of test examples without systematically exploring input variations. Inspired by metamorphic testing in software engineering, we propose a method to probe model uncertainty by systematically generating variations of input queries. This approach allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of model uncertainty and provides a framework for improving confidence calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Uncertainty Testing (MUT), a framework for evaluating and improving model uncertainty estimates. MUT involves defining a set of uncertainty-preserving and uncertainty-altering transformations for input queries. Uncertainty-preserving transformations (e.g., paraphrasing, changing irrelevant details) should not affect the model's confidence, while uncertainty-altering transformations (e.g., removing key information, adding conflicting data) should increase uncertainty.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse set of question-answering tasks from datasets such as SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA. Choose 100-200 questions covering various domains.",
            "Step 2: Define Transformations": "Implement the following transformations:\n1. Paraphrasing (uncertainty-preserving)\n2. Adding irrelevant details (uncertainty-preserving)\n3. Removing key information (uncertainty-altering)\n4. Adding conflicting information (uncertainty-altering)\n5. Generalizing the question (uncertainty-altering)",
            "Step 3: Generate Variations": "For each original question, apply all five transformations to create a set of variations.",
            "Step 4: Construct Prompts": "Design prompts that include:\n1. The original question or its variation\n2. Instructions to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100)\n3. Request for explanation of confidence reasoning\nExample prompt:\n'Question: {question}\nPlease provide your answer to this question, along with a confidence score from 0 to 100, where 0 means completely uncertain and 100 means absolutely certain. Also, explain your reasoning for the confidence score.\nAnswer:\nConfidence Score:\nReasoning:'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments.",
            "Step 6: Baseline Evaluation": "Evaluate the models on the original questions without MUT to establish a baseline for performance and confidence calibration.",
            "Step 7: MUT Evaluation": "Apply MUT by querying the models with the original questions and their variations. Collect answers, confidence scores, and explanations for each.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "1. Compare confidence scores between original questions and their variations.\n2. Identify discrepancies between expected and actual confidence changes.\n3. Analyze explanation quality and consistency.\n4. Calculate calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error) for baseline and MUT results.",
            "Step 9: Confidence Calibration": "Develop a calibration method based on the observed discrepancies. This could involve adjusting the model's confidence scores based on the type of transformation applied.",
            "Step 10: Evaluation of Calibrated Model": "Apply the calibration method to a held-out test set and evaluate its effectiveness in improving confidence estimates.",
            "Step 11: Out-of-Distribution Testing": "Test the calibrated model on a set of out-of-distribution questions to assess generalization of the calibration method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon?\nPlease provide your answer to this question, along with a confidence score from 0 to 100, where 0 means completely uncertain and 100 means absolutely certain. Also, explain your reasoning for the confidence score.\nAnswer:\nConfidence Score:\nReasoning:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon.\nConfidence Score: 100\nReasoning: I'm absolutely certain about this answer because it's a well-known historical fact that has been extensively documented and is widely taught in schools. Neil Armstrong's famous words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' were broadcast live as he became the first human to set foot on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty-altering transformation)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on a celestial body other than Earth?\nPlease provide your answer to this question, along with a confidence score from 0 to 100, where 0 means completely uncertain and 100 means absolutely certain. Also, explain your reasoning for the confidence score.\nAnswer:\nConfidence Score:\nReasoning:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong was likely the first person to step on a celestial body other than Earth, specifically the Moon.\nConfidence Score: 90\nReasoning: I'm highly confident in this answer, but not absolutely certain. Neil Armstrong is famously known as the first person to step on the Moon, which is indeed a celestial body other than Earth. However, the question is phrased more broadly, asking about any celestial body. While I'm not aware of any human stepping on another celestial body before the Moon landing, there's a small possibility that I might be missing some information about potential landings on other bodies (like asteroids) that could have occurred in secret. The slight uncertainty stems from the broader phrasing of the question, but given the extensive documentation of space exploration history, it's highly likely that Armstrong remains the correct answer.",
            "Explanation": "In the baseline prompt, the model expresses absolute certainty (100) about Neil Armstrong being the first person on the moon. However, when faced with the uncertainty-altering transformation that generalizes the question to 'any celestial body,' the model appropriately reduces its confidence to 90. This demonstrates the model's ability to recognize increased uncertainty when the question becomes less specific, which is a desirable behavior for well-calibrated models."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUT method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze patterns in model responses to different types of transformations. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases.\n2. Investigate the quality and consistency of the model's explanations for its confidence scores. This analysis could reveal interesting patterns in how the model justifies its uncertainty.\n3. Explore alternative prompt designs that might be more effective in eliciting well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. For example, we could experiment with different scales for confidence scoring or different phrasings for requesting uncertainty estimates.\n4. Conduct a more in-depth analysis of how different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. inferential) respond to MUT. This could lead to insights about which types of knowledge or reasoning are most susceptible to confidence miscalibration.\n5. Compare the effectiveness of MUT across different model sizes or architectures to understand how model capacity affects uncertainty estimation.\n6. Investigate the potential of using the generated explanations as additional training data for fine-tuning models to produce better-calibrated confidence estimates."
