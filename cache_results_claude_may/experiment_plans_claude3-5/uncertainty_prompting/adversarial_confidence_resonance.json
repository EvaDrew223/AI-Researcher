        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods often produce overconfident estimates and fail to identify subtle flaws in model reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or simple ensemble techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by resonance phenomena in physics, we hypothesize that model uncertainty can be more accurately revealed by probing the model's 'confidence frequencies' through targeted adversarial prompting.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Resonance (ACR), a prompting technique that systematically perturbs the input and model reasoning to identify 'resonant frequencies' of uncertainty. The method involves: 1) Generating a set of adversarial prompts that slightly modify the original task along different dimensions (e.g., rewording, adding distractors). 2) Iteratively applying these prompts with varying 'frequencies' (i.e., intensities and combinations). 3) Analyzing the pattern of model responses to identify resonant uncertainty frequencies where small perturbations lead to large confidence fluctuations. This approach reveals hidden vulnerabilities and provides a nuanced uncertainty profile.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ACR against standard uncertainty estimation methods on challenging reasoning tasks such as logical deduction and causal inference. Assess the method's ability to uncover subtle reasoning flaws and provide more accurate confidence estimates in adversarial scenarios."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Resonance: Unveiling Hidden Uncertainties in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often produce overconfident estimates and fail to identify subtle flaws in model reasoning. This problem is particularly acute in complex reasoning tasks where models may appear confident despite making logical errors or relying on faulty premises.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or simple ensemble techniques. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced ways in which model confidence can fluctuate under slight perturbations to the input or reasoning process. Inspired by resonance phenomena in physics, we hypothesize that model uncertainty can be more accurately revealed by probing the model's 'confidence frequencies' through targeted adversarial prompting. This approach aims to identify hidden vulnerabilities and provide a more nuanced uncertainty profile, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable model outputs in critical reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Resonance (ACR), a prompting technique that systematically perturbs the input and model reasoning to identify 'resonant frequencies' of uncertainty. The method involves three main steps: 1) Generating a set of adversarial prompts that slightly modify the original task along different dimensions (e.g., rewording, adding distractors, changing context). 2) Iteratively applying these prompts with varying 'frequencies' (i.e., intensities and combinations). 3) Analyzing the pattern of model responses to identify resonant uncertainty frequencies where small perturbations lead to large confidence fluctuations. This approach aims to reveal hidden vulnerabilities and provide a more comprehensive uncertainty profile.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) LogiQA: A dataset for testing logical reasoning abilities. 2) CLUTRR: A dataset for testing multi-hop relational reasoning. These datasets are chosen because they involve complex reasoning where subtle flaws might be overlooked by standard uncertainty estimation methods.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each prompt. 2) Ensemble method: Use 5 different prompts for each question and calculate the variance in responses as a measure of uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: ACR Implementation": "Implement the Adversarial Confidence Resonance method: a) Generate adversarial prompts: For each question, create 10 variations that slightly modify the task (e.g., rewording, adding irrelevant information, changing names or numbers). b) Apply prompts with varying frequencies: Create combinations of these adversarial prompts, applying them with different intensities (e.g., single perturbation, double perturbation, etc.). c) Analyze response patterns: Implement a function to identify 'resonant frequencies' where small perturbations lead to large confidence fluctuations.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are chosen for their strong performance on reasoning tasks and their widespread use in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect uncertainty estimates. b) Run ACR method, collecting model responses for each adversarial prompt combination. c) Analyze ACR results to identify resonant frequencies and generate uncertainty profiles.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare ACR results with baseline methods using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: How well do uncertainty estimates align with actual error rates? 2) Spearman rank correlation: How well do uncertainty estimates rank questions from most to least certain? 3) Qualitative analysis: Manually inspect cases where ACR identifies high uncertainty but baselines do not, to verify if these represent genuine flaws in reasoning.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Visualization": "Create visualizations to illustrate the 'resonance patterns' identified by ACR. This could include heatmaps showing how confidence changes across different perturbation frequencies, or graphs showing the relationship between perturbation intensity and confidence fluctuation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: All dogs have tails. Some pets are dogs. Therefore, some pets have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Yes, this is a valid logical conclusion. The reasoning follows the syllogistic form: All A are B. Some C are A. Therefore, some C are B. This is a valid form of logical reasoning. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACR; Step 1: Generate Adversarial Prompts)": "Generate 3 variations of the following logical reasoning question, introducing subtle changes that might affect the reasoning process: 'All dogs have tails. Some pets are dogs. Therefore, some pets have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACR; Step 1: Generate Adversarial Prompts)": "1. All canines have tails. Some household companions are canines. Therefore, some household companions have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion?\n2. Most dogs have tails. Some pets are dogs. Therefore, some pets have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion?\n3. All dogs have tails. Some animals without tails are pets. Therefore, some pets have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ACR; Step 2: Apply Prompts with Varying Frequencies)": "Please answer each of the following questions and rate your confidence on a scale of 0-100:\n1. All dogs have tails. Some pets are dogs. Therefore, some pets have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion?\n2. All canines have tails. Some household companions are canines. Therefore, some household companions have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion?\n3. Most dogs have tails. Some pets are dogs. Therefore, some pets have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion?\n4. All dogs have tails. Some animals without tails are pets. Therefore, some pets have tails. Is this a valid logical conclusion?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ACR; Step 2: Apply Prompts with Varying Frequencies)": "1. Yes, this is a valid logical conclusion. Confidence: 95\n2. Yes, this is a valid logical conclusion. Confidence: 90\n3. No, this is not a valid logical conclusion. The premise 'Most dogs have tails' doesn't guarantee that all dogs have tails, so we can't be certain about the conclusion. Confidence: 80\n4. Yes, this is still a valid logical conclusion. The additional information about some pets not having tails doesn't invalidate the conclusion that some pets (specifically, those that are dogs) have tails. Confidence: 85",
            "explanation": "The ACR method reveals fluctuations in model confidence across subtle variations of the same logical structure. While the baseline method shows high confidence, ACR uncovers potential areas of uncertainty, particularly when the logical structure is slightly altered (as in prompts 3 and 4)."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ACR method doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods in identifying subtle reasoning flaws, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why ACR failed to capture certain types of uncertainties. This could lead to insights about the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning tasks. 2) Explore combining ACR with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as temperature scaling or dropout-based approaches, to create a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches. 3) Investigate whether the patterns of confidence fluctuations revealed by ACR, even if not directly improving uncertainty estimation, could be used as features for a machine learning model to predict reasoning errors. This could turn the project into a novel approach for automated error detection in LLM reasoning."
