        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to provide fine-grained, interpretable uncertainty estimates for complex multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single-step confidence scores or ensemble disagreement metrics.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how humans break down complex problems and assess confidence at each step, we propose a method to decompose uncertainty hierarchically.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hierarchical Confidence Decomposition (HCD) prompting. Given a complex task, we first prompt the LLM to break it down into a hierarchical structure of subtasks. For each subtask, we then prompt the model to provide both an answer and a confidence score. We use carefully crafted prompts to elicit these decompositions and confidence estimates, such as 'Please break down this problem into smaller steps, then solve each step while providing a confidence score from 0-100%'. The final confidence is computed by aggregating the subtask confidences using a weighted average based on their hierarchical importance.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate HCD against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH. We'll measure both task performance and calibration metrics like expected calibration error."

        "Title": "Hierarchical Confidence Decomposition: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Step Reasoning",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to provide fine-grained, interpretable uncertainty estimates for complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders their reliability and applicability in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches often rely on single-step confidence scores or ensemble disagreement metrics, which fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties in multi-step reasoning processes. Inspired by how humans break down complex problems and assess confidence at each step, we propose a method to decompose uncertainty hierarchically. This approach aims to provide more accurate, interpretable, and fine-grained uncertainty estimates for LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hierarchical Confidence Decomposition (HCD) prompting. Given a complex task, we first prompt the LLM to break it down into a hierarchical structure of subtasks. For each subtask, we then prompt the model to provide both an answer and a confidence score. We use carefully crafted prompts to elicit these decompositions and confidence estimates, such as 'Please break down this problem into smaller steps, then solve each step while providing a confidence score from 0-100%'. The final confidence is computed by aggregating the subtask confidences using a weighted average based on their hierarchical importance.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: GSM8K for mathematical reasoning and MATH for advanced mathematical problem-solving. Both datasets contain multi-step reasoning problems, making them suitable for our hierarchical approach.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: simply ask the LLM to solve the problem; (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: use the standard CoT prompt 'Let's approach this step by step'; (3) Calibrated confidence: use temperature scaling to calibrate the model's output probabilities.",
            "Step 3: HCD Prompt Design": "Design the HCD prompt template. For example: 'Please follow these steps: 1) Break down the problem into a hierarchical structure of subtasks. 2) Solve each subtask, providing an answer and a confidence score (0-100%) for each. 3) Explain how you would combine these subtask confidences to get an overall confidence.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each problem in our datasets, collect outputs from both baseline methods and our HCD method. Store the full model outputs, including intermediate steps and confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Confidence Aggregation": "Implement the confidence aggregation method based on the model's explanation. If the model doesn't provide a clear aggregation method, use a simple weighted average based on the hierarchical level of each subtask.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Task performance: accuracy on the GSM8K and MATH datasets; (2) Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and reliability diagrams; (3) Uncertainty quality: Brier score and log loss; (4) Interpretability: human evaluation of the decomposition quality and confidence justifications.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis, including: (1) Comparison of HCD vs baselines across all metrics; (2) Correlation between subtask confidences and correctness; (3) Impact of problem complexity on the effectiveness of HCD; (4) Qualitative analysis of the hierarchical decompositions and confidence justifications."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more, then gives 2 to his friend. How many apples does John have now?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "John has 6 apples now.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more, then gives 2 to his friend. How many apples does John have now? Please follow these steps: 1) Break down the problem into a hierarchical structure of subtasks. 2) Solve each subtask, providing an answer and a confidence score (0-100%) for each. 3) Explain how you would combine these subtask confidences to get an overall confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Problem Breakdown:\n   1.1. Initial number of apples (Confidence: 100%)\n   1.2. Apples bought (Confidence: 100%)\n   1.3. Apples given away (Confidence: 100%)\n   1.4. Final calculation (Confidence: 95%)\n\n2. Solving Subtasks:\n   1.1. Initial number: John has 5 apples (Confidence: 100%)\n   1.2. Apples bought: John buys 3 more apples (Confidence: 100%)\n   1.3. Apples given away: John gives 2 apples to his friend (Confidence: 100%)\n   1.4. Final calculation: 5 + 3 - 2 = 6 apples (Confidence: 95%)\n\n3. Overall Confidence:\nTo combine the subtask confidences, I would use a weighted average, giving more weight to the final calculation as it incorporates all previous steps. The weights could be: 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.7 for the four subtasks respectively.\n\nOverall confidence = (100% * 0.1) + (100% * 0.1) + (100% * 0.1) + (95% * 0.7) = 96.5%\n\nTherefore, I am 96.5% confident that John has 6 apples now.",
            "Explanation": "The HCD method provides a detailed breakdown of the problem, assigns confidence scores to each step, and explains how to aggregate these scores. This approach offers more insight into the model's reasoning process and uncertainty at each step, compared to the baseline which only provides a final answer without any indication of confidence or reasoning steps."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed HCD method doesn't significantly improve over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: (1) The quality of the hierarchical decompositions - are they logical and truly breaking down the problem effectively? (2) The accuracy of subtask confidence scores - do they correlate well with actual correctness? (3) The effectiveness of the confidence aggregation method - is it capturing the overall uncertainty accurately? Based on these analyses, we could refine our prompting strategy, experiment with different confidence aggregation methods, or explore ways to improve the model's ability to estimate confidence for individual subtasks. Additionally, we could investigate how the effectiveness of HCD varies across different types of reasoning tasks, potentially identifying specific domains where it's most beneficial. This could lead to insights about the nature of uncertainty in LLM reasoning and inform future approaches to uncertainty quantification."
