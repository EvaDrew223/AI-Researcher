        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often struggle to capture fine-grained, hierarchical uncertainties across different levels of abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on global uncertainty estimates or use simple ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by fractal geometry, we propose that uncertainty in language models may have a self-similar structure across different scales of abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Fractal Prompting, which recursively decomposes a given query into a tree of sub-queries at multiple levels of abstraction. At each level, the LLM is prompted to provide both an answer and an uncertainty estimate. The process continues until reaching atomic sub-queries or a predefined depth. The method then aggregates these multi-scale uncertainties using a novel fractal dimension-inspired metric, providing a rich, hierarchical uncertainty representation. The prompting process involves carefully crafted instructions guiding the LLM to perform this recursive decomposition and uncertainty estimation at each level.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method against baselines like direct uncertainty estimation and ensemble methods on tasks requiring multi-scale reasoning, such as complex question-answering and long-form text generation. We'll use metrics like calibration error and a new hierarchical uncertainty score."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Fractal Prompting: Hierarchical Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to capture fine-grained, hierarchical uncertainties across different levels of abstraction. This limitation hinders the ability to accurately assess and interpret model confidence in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on global uncertainty estimates or use simple ensemble methods, which fail to capture the nuanced, multi-scale nature of uncertainty in language understanding and generation. Inspired by fractal geometry, we propose that uncertainty in language models may have a self-similar structure across different scales of abstraction. This insight motivates our novel approach to uncertainty quantification that can potentially provide more informative and interpretable uncertainty estimates for LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Fractal Prompting (UFP), which recursively decomposes a given query into a tree of sub-queries at multiple levels of abstraction. At each level, the LLM is prompted to provide both an answer and an uncertainty estimate. The process continues until reaching atomic sub-queries or a predefined depth. UFP then aggregates these multi-scale uncertainties using a novel fractal dimension-inspired metric, providing a rich, hierarchical uncertainty representation. The prompting process involves carefully crafted instructions guiding the LLM to perform this recursive decomposition and uncertainty estimation at each level.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require multi-scale reasoning: (1) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, (2) MATH dataset for mathematical problem-solving, and (3) CommonGen for constrained text generation. These datasets cover a range of tasks that benefit from hierarchical reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct uncertainty estimation: prompt the LLM to provide a single uncertainty score along with its answer. (2) Ensemble method: use multiple LLM calls with different prompts and calculate the variance of outputs. (3) Monte Carlo Dropout: if using an open-source LLM, apply MC Dropout during inference.",
            "Step 3: UFP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Fractal Prompting method: (a) Design a recursive prompting strategy that decomposes queries into sub-queries. (b) Implement the uncertainty estimation at each level. (c) Develop the aggregation method for combining multi-scale uncertainties.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for our main experiments. For comparison, we'll also use the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of UFP against baselines using: (1) Calibration error to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates. (2) A new hierarchical uncertainty score that measures how well the method captures uncertainty at different levels of abstraction. (3) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., F1 score for QA, accuracy for math problems).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, including: (1) Visualization of the uncertainty trees generated by UFP. (2) Comparison of UFP performance across different types of queries and abstraction levels. (3) Analysis of cases where UFP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Uncertainty Estimation)": "Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have now? Please provide your answer and your uncertainty estimate (0-100%, where 0% means absolutely certain and 100% means completely uncertain).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Uncertainty Estimation)": "Answer: The cafeteria now has 9 apples. Calculation: 23 - 20 + 6 = 9. Uncertainty estimate: 10%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UFP; Level 1)": "Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have now? Please decompose this problem into smaller sub-problems. For each sub-problem, provide an answer and an uncertainty estimate (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UFP; Level 1)": "Sub-problems:\n1. How many apples were left after making lunch? Answer: 3 apples (23 - 20). Uncertainty: 5%\n2. How many apples were added after lunch? Answer: 6 apples. Uncertainty: 2%\n3. What is the sum of remaining and added apples? Answer: 9 apples (3 + 6). Uncertainty: 8%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UFP; Level 2)": "For the sub-problem 'How many apples were left after making lunch?', please further decompose it if possible and estimate uncertainty for each component.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UFP; Level 2)": "Components:\n1. Initial number of apples: 23. Uncertainty: 1%\n2. Number of apples used for lunch: 20. Uncertainty: 3%\n3. Subtraction operation: 23 - 20 = 3. Uncertainty: 2%",
            "explanation": "UFP provides a more detailed uncertainty breakdown, allowing us to pinpoint where the model is most uncertain. This hierarchical approach can potentially lead to more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates compared to the single global estimate in the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UFP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated uncertainty trees to understand where and why the method fails. This could lead to insights about how LLMs reason about uncertainty at different abstraction levels. (2) Explore alternative aggregation methods for combining multi-scale uncertainties, potentially drawing inspiration from other fields like signal processing or multi-scale image analysis. (3) Investigate how the performance of UFP varies across different types of tasks and query complexities, which could lead to a paper on the limits and capabilities of hierarchical uncertainty estimation in LLMs. (4) Combine UFP with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to see if there are synergistic effects in improving both task performance and uncertainty estimation."
