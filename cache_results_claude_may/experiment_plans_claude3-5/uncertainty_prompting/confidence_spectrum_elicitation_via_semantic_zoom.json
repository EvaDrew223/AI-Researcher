    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often produce single-point estimates, failing to capture the nuanced spectrum of confidence across different semantic levels of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Traditional approaches like temperature scaling or ensemble methods provide overall uncertainty estimates but lack granularity.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the human cognitive process of zooming in and out of concepts, we propose a method to elicit a full spectrum of confidence across different semantic levels of an LLM's response.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique called Semantic Zoom Confidence Elicitation (SZCE). Given an initial response, SZCE recursively prompts the LLM to 'zoom in' on specific parts of its answer and 'zoom out' to more general concepts, each time asking for a confidence estimate. This creates a hierarchical confidence map spanning from high-level concepts to specific details. The prompt structure includes instructions like 'Zoom in on [specific part] and provide your confidence' and 'Now zoom out to a more general concept that encompasses [current focus] and state your confidence'. This process continues until a predefined depth is reached or the LLM indicates it cannot zoom further.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SZCE against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and calibrated softmax probabilities on tasks from the TruthfulQA and MMLU datasets. We'll measure the granularity and accuracy of confidence estimates using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score, as well as introducing a new metric called Confidence Spectrum Coverage (CSC) to assess the range and depth of confidence estimates produced."

        "Title": "Semantic Zoom Confidence Elicitation: Quantifying Uncertainty Across Semantic Levels in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce single-point estimates, failing to capture the nuanced spectrum of confidence across different semantic levels of a response. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret the model's certainty in various aspects of its output, potentially leading to misinterpretation of results and suboptimal decision-making based on LLM outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like temperature scaling or ensemble methods provide overall uncertainty estimates but lack granularity. Inspired by the human cognitive process of zooming in and out of concepts, we propose a method to elicit a full spectrum of confidence across different semantic levels of an LLM's response. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of model uncertainty, potentially improving the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs across various applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Zoom Confidence Elicitation (SZCE), a novel prompting technique that recursively prompts the LLM to 'zoom in' on specific parts of its answer and 'zoom out' to more general concepts, each time asking for a confidence estimate. This creates a hierarchical confidence map spanning from high-level concepts to specific details. The prompt structure includes instructions like 'Zoom in on [specific part] and provide your confidence' and 'Now zoom out to a more general concept that encompasses [current focus] and state your confidence'. This process continues until a predefined depth is reached or the LLM indicates it cannot zoom further.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA and MMLU datasets for our experiments. TruthfulQA will help evaluate the method's effectiveness in identifying model uncertainty in factual claims, while MMLU will test its performance across a wide range of academic and real-world knowledge domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: simply ask the model to provide a single confidence score for its answer. (2) Calibrated softmax probabilities: use the model's output probabilities as a measure of confidence.",
            "Step 3: SZCE Implementation": "Implement the SZCE method with the following steps: a) Generate an initial response to the question. b) Prompt the model to zoom in on specific parts of the answer, asking for confidence at each level. c) Prompt the model to zoom out to more general concepts, again asking for confidence. d) Repeat steps b and c until a predefined depth is reached or the model indicates it cannot zoom further.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Generate answers and confidence estimates using the baseline methods. b) Generate answers and hierarchical confidence estimates using SZCE. c) Record all outputs, including intermediate steps for SZCE.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): to assess the overall calibration of confidence estimates. b) Brier Score: to measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Confidence Spectrum Coverage (CSC): a new metric we introduce to assess the range and depth of confidence estimates produced by SZCE.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform a detailed analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of SZCE performance against baselines. b) Analysis of confidence patterns across different semantic levels. c) Investigation of cases where SZCE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Direct Confidence Elicitation Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 95%",
                "Calibrated Softmax Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 0.98"
            },
            "SZCE Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Initial Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Overall Confidence: 95%",
                "Zoom In 1": "Zoom in on 'Neil Armstrong': Neil Armstrong was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer. Confidence: 98%",
                "Zoom In 2": "Zoom in on 'first person to walk on the moon': The moon landing occurred on July 20, 1969, as part of the Apollo 11 mission. Confidence: 97%",
                "Zoom Out 1": "Zoom out to 'Space Exploration': The moon landing was a significant milestone in human space exploration during the Space Race. Confidence: 99%",
                "Explanation": "SZCE provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence across different aspects of the answer, from specific details about Neil Armstrong to broader concepts of space exploration. This hierarchical confidence mapping allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the model's certainty levels across different semantic levels."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SZCE doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why hierarchical confidence elicitation might not improve uncertainty quantification. We could investigate whether the model's confidence varies meaningfully across semantic levels, or if there are specific types of questions or domains where SZCE is more effective. Additionally, we could explore alternative prompting strategies or modifications to the SZCE method, such as incorporating external knowledge sources or using different zoom patterns. Another direction could be to analyze how the hierarchical confidence estimates correlate with actual correctness, potentially revealing insights into the model's self-awareness across different levels of abstraction."
