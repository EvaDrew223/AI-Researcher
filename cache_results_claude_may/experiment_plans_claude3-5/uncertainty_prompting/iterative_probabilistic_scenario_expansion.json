        "Problem": "LLMs often provide point estimates of confidence without fully exploring the space of possible scenarios that could affect the probability of their answer being correct.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically focus on single-shot confidence estimation or limited forms of self-consistency checking.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by techniques like Monte Carlo tree search, we propose an iterative method to explore and expand the probability space of possible scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Probabilistic Scenario Expansion (IPSE), a multi-step prompting process: 1) Initial Answer and Probability: Prompt for an initial answer and probability estimate. 2) Scenario Generation: Prompt the model to generate a possible scenario that could affect the probability of the answer. For example, 'Describe a plausible scenario that could significantly change the probability of your answer.' 3) Probability Update: Based on this scenario, prompt the model to update its probability estimate and explain the change. 4) Iterate: Repeat steps 2-3 multiple times, each time prompting for a new, distinct scenario. 5) Aggregation: Finally, prompt the model to aggregate insights from all scenarios, providing a final probability estimate and uncertainty range. The prompt could be: 'Considering all generated scenarios, provide a final probability estimate and a 90% confidence interval for your answer. Explain your reasoning.'",

        "Title": "Iterative Probabilistic Scenario Expansion (IPSE): Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide point estimates of confidence without fully exploring the space of possible scenarios that could affect the probability of their answer being correct. This leads to overconfidence and poor calibration in their uncertainty estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods typically focus on single-shot confidence estimation or limited forms of self-consistency checking. These approaches fail to capture the full range of potential scenarios that could impact the probability of an answer. Inspired by techniques like Monte Carlo tree search, we propose an iterative method to explore and expand the probability space of possible scenarios. This approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment of uncertainty and better calibration of confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Probabilistic Scenario Expansion (IPSE), a multi-step prompting process: 1) Initial Answer and Probability: Prompt for an initial answer and probability estimate. 2) Scenario Generation: Prompt the model to generate a possible scenario that could affect the probability of the answer. 3) Probability Update: Based on this scenario, prompt the model to update its probability estimate and explain the change. 4) Iterate: Repeat steps 2-3 multiple times, each time prompting for a new, distinct scenario. 5) Aggregation: Finally, prompt the model to aggregate insights from all scenarios, providing a final probability estimate and uncertainty range.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use probabilistic reasoning tasks from datasets like SacreBLEU and ProbingQA. Select a subset of questions that require probabilistic reasoning and have well-defined correct answers.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard probability elicitation methods: a) Direct probability estimation: Ask the model to provide a single probability estimate. b) Confidence interval estimation: Ask the model to provide a 90% confidence interval for its estimate.",
            "Step 3: IPSE Implementation": "Implement the IPSE method with the following steps: a) Initial answer and probability estimation. b) Scenario generation (3 iterations). c) Probability updates after each scenario. d) Final aggregation and confidence interval estimation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply baseline methods. b) Apply IPSE method. c) Record all intermediate steps, probability estimates, and final confidence intervals.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare IPSE against baselines using metrics such as: a) Calibration error (compare estimated probabilities with empirical frequencies of correctness). b) Brier score (measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions). c) Interval coverage (check if true answers fall within the estimated confidence intervals).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Analyze the diversity of generated scenarios. b) Examine the convergence of probability estimates over iterations. c) Investigate cases where IPSE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Probability Estimation)": "Q: What is the probability that a randomly selected day in a non-leap year is a Monday? Please provide your answer as a single probability between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Probability Estimation)": "The probability that a randomly selected day in a non-leap year is a Monday is 1/7 or approximately 0.1429.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPSE; Step 1: Initial Answer and Probability)": "Q: What is the probability that a randomly selected day in a non-leap year is a Monday? Please provide your initial answer and probability estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPSE; Step 1: Initial Answer and Probability)": "Initial Answer: The probability that a randomly selected day in a non-leap year is a Monday is 1/7 or approximately 0.1429. Initial Probability Estimate: 0.1429 (14.29%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPSE; Step 2: Scenario Generation)": "Describe a plausible scenario that could significantly change the probability of your answer to the question: 'What is the probability that a randomly selected day in a non-leap year is a Monday?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPSE; Step 2: Scenario Generation)": "Scenario: If the selection is not truly random but biased towards weekdays (e.g., if the selection process only considers business days), the probability of selecting a Monday would increase.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPSE; Step 3: Probability Update)": "Based on the scenario you just described, update your probability estimate for the question: 'What is the probability that a randomly selected day in a non-leap year is a Monday?' Explain your reasoning for the change.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPSE; Step 3: Probability Update)": "Updated Probability Estimate: 0.2000 (20.00%)\nExplanation: If the selection is biased towards weekdays, there are 5 possible days (Monday to Friday) instead of 7. In this case, the probability of selecting a Monday would increase to 1/5 or 0.2. This scenario increases our uncertainty about the true randomness of the selection process, which affects our probability estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPSE; Step 4: Aggregation)": "Considering all generated scenarios and probability updates, provide a final probability estimate and a 90% confidence interval for the answer to the question: 'What is the probability that a randomly selected day in a non-leap year is a Monday?' Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPSE; Step 4: Aggregation)": "Final Probability Estimate: 0.1429 (14.29%)\n90% Confidence Interval: [0.1300, 0.1600]\nExplanation: After considering various scenarios, we return to our initial estimate of 1/7 as the most likely probability, assuming true randomness. However, the scenarios explored (such as potential weekday bias) have widened our confidence interval. The lower bound accounts for potential scenarios where Mondays might be slightly underrepresented, while the upper bound accounts for scenarios where Mondays might be overrepresented. This interval reflects our increased uncertainty due to the potential scenarios we've considered.",
            "explanation": "IPSE prompts the model to consider multiple scenarios, updating its probability estimates and explaining its reasoning at each step. This process leads to a more nuanced final estimate with a well-justified confidence interval, capturing a broader range of uncertainties compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If IPSE doesn't significantly improve calibration or uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the generated scenarios to understand why they didn't lead to improved estimates. This might reveal interesting patterns in how LLMs reason about probabilities. Second, we could experiment with variations of IPSE, such as increasing the number of iterations or modifying the aggregation step. Third, we could compare IPSE's performance across different types of questions to identify where it's most effective. Finally, we could use IPSE as a tool to analyze LLM biases in probabilistic reasoning, examining how different phrasings or contexts in the initial question affect the scenarios generated and final estimates."
