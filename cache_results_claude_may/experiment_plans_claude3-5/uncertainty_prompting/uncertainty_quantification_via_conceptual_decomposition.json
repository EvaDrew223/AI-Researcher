    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for complex queries that involve multiple concepts or reasoning steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often treat queries as atomic units, failing to account for the compositional nature of complex questions.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down complex queries into their constituent concepts and quantifying uncertainty for each part, we can achieve a more granular and accurate overall uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Decomposition Prompting (CDP). Given a complex query, CDP first prompts the model to break it down into its core concepts and reasoning steps. For each component, the model is then asked to provide an answer and an associated confidence score. Finally, these individual scores are aggregated using a learnable function to produce an overall uncertainty estimate. This method allows for more nuanced uncertainty quantification that accounts for the model's varying confidence across different aspects of the query.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CDP against baseline methods on datasets featuring complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Measure performance using calibration plots, ECE, and human evaluation of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Conceptual Decomposition Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for complex queries that involve multiple concepts or reasoning steps. This limitation hinders their reliability and applicability in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches often treat queries as atomic units, failing to account for the compositional nature of complex questions. By breaking down complex queries into their constituent concepts and quantifying uncertainty for each part, we can achieve a more granular and accurate overall uncertainty estimate. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often break down complex problems into simpler components to better assess our confidence in each part.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Decomposition Prompting (CDP). Given a complex query, CDP first prompts the model to break it down into its core concepts and reasoning steps. For each component, the model is then asked to provide an answer and an associated confidence score. Finally, these individual scores are aggregated using a learnable function to produce an overall uncertainty estimate. This method allows for more nuanced uncertainty quantification that accounts for the model's varying confidence across different aspects of the query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that feature complex, multi-step reasoning tasks: (1) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, (2) GSM8K for multi-step math word problems, and (3) TruthfulQA for assessing model uncertainty in factual claims.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting with uncertainty estimation, (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with uncertainty estimation, and (3) Calibrated language modeling.",
            "Step 3: Implement CDP": "Develop prompts for each step of CDP: (a) Concept decomposition, (b) Per-concept answering and confidence estimation, and (c) Aggregation of confidence scores.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: (1) Calibration plots, (2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (3) Brier score, and (4) Area Under the Confidence-Accuracy Curve.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Run baseline methods, (b) Run CDP method, (c) Collect predictions and uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare CDP against baselines using the defined metrics. Perform qualitative analysis on a subset of examples to understand where and why CDP performs better or worse.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of CDP, such as the number of decomposed concepts and the aggregation function used."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year that Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States? Please provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2009, the same year Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President, was Danny Boyle for 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Confidence level: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDP; Step 1: Concept Decomposition)": "Q: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year that Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States? Please break down this question into its core concepts and reasoning steps.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDP; Step 1: Concept Decomposition)": "1. Identify the year Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States.\n2. Determine which film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in that year.\n3. Identify the director of that film.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDP; Step 2: Per-concept Answering)": "For each concept, provide an answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100:\n1. In which year was Barack Obama first inaugurated as President of the United States?\n2. Which film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in that year?\n3. Who directed that film?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDP; Step 2: Per-concept Answering)": "1. Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States in 2009. Confidence: 98\n2. The film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2009 was 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Confidence: 90\n3. 'Slumdog Millionaire' was directed by Danny Boyle. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDP; Step 3: Aggregation)": "Based on the individual concept answers and confidence levels, provide a final answer to the original question and an overall confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDP; Step 3: Aggregation)": "A: The director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2009, the same year Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President, was Danny Boyle for 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Overall confidence level: 92",
            "Explanation": "CDP breaks down the complex query into simpler concepts, allowing for more precise confidence estimation for each part. The final aggregation provides a more nuanced overall confidence score, which is likely to be more accurate than the baseline method's single confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CDP does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a thorough error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining cases where CDP performs worse than baselines, analyzing the quality and relevance of the concept decompositions, and investigating whether the confidence aggregation method is appropriate. We could also explore alternative decomposition strategies, such as hierarchical decomposition for very complex queries, or incorporating external knowledge sources to improve the accuracy of individual concept answers. Additionally, we might consider turning this into an analysis paper, focusing on how different types of questions benefit (or don't benefit) from conceptual decomposition, which could provide valuable insights for future research in this area."
