        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex reasoning tasks where confidence should vary across different steps or aspects of the solution.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods often provide only coarse-grained uncertainty estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by gradient descent in optimization, we can iteratively refine confidence estimates by probing the model's certainty on increasingly granular aspects of the problem.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Gradient Descent Prompting (CGDP), a multi-step prompting technique that progressively decomposes a problem and refines uncertainty estimates. CGDP starts with a high-level confidence query, then iteratively 'descends' into more specific sub-queries based on the model's responses. For example, given a math problem, CGDP might first ask for overall confidence, then probe confidence in understanding the problem, selecting a solution method, and executing each step. At each iteration, the prompt includes previous confidence estimates and asks the model to adjust them based on new information. This creates a 'gradient' of confidence across problem components.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CGDP against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on tasks from the MATH dataset and TruthfulQA. We'll measure calibration using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and compare the granularity of uncertainty estimates produced by each method."

        "Title": "Confidence Gradient Descent Prompting: Iterative Refinement of Uncertainty Estimates in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex reasoning tasks where confidence should vary across different steps or aspects of the solution. Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods often provide only coarse-grained uncertainty estimates. This project aims to develop a novel prompting method that can better quantify uncertainty and calibrate the confidence of large language models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods, often fail to capture the nuanced variations in confidence across different aspects of complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by gradient descent in optimization, we propose an iterative approach to refine confidence estimates by probing the model's certainty on increasingly granular aspects of the problem. This method, Confidence Gradient Descent Prompting (CGDP), aims to create a 'gradient' of confidence across problem components, potentially leading to more accurate and fine-grained uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Gradient Descent Prompting (CGDP), a multi-step prompting technique that progressively decomposes a problem and refines uncertainty estimates. CGDP starts with a high-level confidence query, then iteratively 'descends' into more specific sub-queries based on the model's responses.

At each iteration, the prompt includes previous confidence estimates and asks the model to adjust them based on new information. This creates a 'gradient' of confidence across problem components.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning tasks, and 2) TruthfulQA for general knowledge and reasoning tasks. For each dataset, we'll randomly sample 100 questions for our experiments to ensure manageable computation time.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Ensemble method: Use 5 different prompts for each question and aggregate the results.",
            "Step 3: CGDP Implementation": "Implement the CGDP method with the following steps: a) Initial confidence query, b) Problem decomposition, c) Confidence refinement for each sub-component, d) Final confidence aggregation. Use a maximum of 5 iterations for each question.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments. Ensure API access and set up proper error handling and rate limiting.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (2 baselines + CGDP), run the experiments on the sampled questions. Store all intermediate outputs, including confidence estimates at each step for CGDP.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Brier Score, 3) Confidence resolution (standard deviation of confidence estimates across sub-components for CGDP).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CGDP against the baselines. Analyze how confidence estimates change across iterations in CGDP. Investigate cases where CGDP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the area of a circle with radius 5 cm? Please provide your answer and then state your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100.",
                "Output": "A: The area of a circle with radius 5 cm is 78.54 cm\u00b2. My confidence in this answer is 95 out of 100.",
                "Explanation": "This baseline method provides a single, overall confidence estimate without breaking down the problem or refining the estimate."
            },
            "CGDP Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the area of a circle with radius 5 cm?",
                "Step 1 (Initial Confidence)": "Before we solve this problem, let's assess our initial confidence. On a scale of 0-100, how confident are you that you can solve this problem correctly?",
                "Model Output 1": "Initial confidence: 90/100. I'm quite confident in solving problems related to the area of a circle.",
                "Step 2 (Problem Decomposition)": "Let's break down this problem into steps. What are the key components or steps needed to solve this problem?",
                "Model Output 2": "1. Recall the formula for the area of a circle\n2. Identify the given radius\n3. Substitute the radius into the formula\n4. Perform the calculation\n5. Round the result to an appropriate number of decimal places",
                "Step 3 (Confidence Refinement)": "Now, let's assess our confidence for each step. For each step, provide a confidence score out of 100 and explain why:",
                "Model Output 3": "1. Recalling the formula: 100/100 - I'm certain the formula is A = \u03c0r\u00b2\n2. Identifying the radius: 100/100 - The question clearly states the radius is 5 cm\n3. Substituting into the formula: 100/100 - Simple substitution of 5 for r\n4. Performing the calculation: 95/100 - Confident in multiplication, slight uncertainty due to \u03c0\n5. Rounding: 90/100 - Slight uncertainty about the appropriate number of decimal places",
                "Step 4 (Final Confidence Aggregation)": "Based on these component confidences, what is your overall confidence in solving this problem correctly? Explain your reasoning.",
                "Model Output 4": "Final confidence: 97/100. The high confidence in most steps, especially in recalling the formula and identifying the given information, contributes to a very high overall confidence. The slight uncertainties in calculation and rounding slightly reduce the perfect score, but not significantly.",
                "Final Answer": "The area of a circle with radius 5 cm is approximately 78.54 cm\u00b2. My final confidence in this answer is 97 out of 100.",
                "Explanation": "CGDP provides a more nuanced confidence estimate by breaking down the problem and assessing confidence at each step. This allows for identification of specific areas of uncertainty and a more informed final confidence estimate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CGDP doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can explore several alternatives. First, we could analyze the confidence estimates at each step of CGDP to understand where the method might be failing. This could involve examining whether certain types of sub-tasks consistently lead to over- or under-confidence. We could also investigate whether the number of decomposition steps affects performance, potentially leading to an optimal decomposition strategy. Additionally, we could explore combining CGDP with other prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting, to see if this hybrid approach yields better results. If these approaches don't yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper, focusing on why iterative confidence refinement doesn't work as expected and what this reveals about the nature of uncertainty in large language models. This could include ablation studies on different components of CGDP and detailed error analysis across different types of reasoning tasks."
