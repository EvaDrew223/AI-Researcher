        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, particularly when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on post-hoc calibration or uncertainty estimation methods applied to model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring counterfactual scenarios, we can probe the model's understanding of its own knowledge boundaries and refine its confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Refinement (CCR), a multi-step prompting method. First, the model is asked to answer a question and provide an initial confidence estimate. Then, it is prompted to generate several counterfactual scenarios that would change its answer or confidence level. For each scenario, the model explains how and why its confidence would change. Finally, the model is asked to revisit its original confidence estimate in light of these counterfactuals, potentially adjusting it and providing a justification. This process encourages the model to consider potential gaps in its knowledge and refine its uncertainty estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCR against standard confidence estimation techniques on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets for various tasks. Measure improvements in calibration, detection of adversarial inputs, and the quality of uncertainty explanations."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Refinement: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, particularly when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misuse of the models in critical applications. Existing methods for uncertainty estimation typically focus on post-hoc calibration or uncertainty estimation methods applied to model outputs, which may not fully capture the model's understanding of its own knowledge boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in large language models often rely on external calibration techniques or separate uncertainty prediction models. These methods may not fully leverage the model's own understanding of its knowledge and limitations. By exploring counterfactual scenarios, we can probe the model's understanding of its own knowledge boundaries and refine its confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often consider alternative scenarios to assess our confidence in a decision. By encouraging the model to engage in this type of reasoning, we aim to produce more reliable and well-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Refinement (CCR), a multi-step prompting method to improve uncertainty estimation in large language models. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Initial answer and confidence estimation, 2) Counterfactual scenario generation, 3) Confidence impact analysis, and 4) Refined confidence estimation. In the first step, the model is asked to answer a question and provide an initial confidence estimate. Then, it is prompted to generate several counterfactual scenarios that would change its answer or confidence level. For each scenario, the model explains how and why its confidence would change. Finally, the model is asked to revisit its original confidence estimate in light of these counterfactuals, potentially adjusting it and providing a justification. This process encourages the model to consider potential gaps in its knowledge and refine its uncertainty estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of CCR. For in-distribution data, we'll use the TriviaQA dataset for factual question answering. For out-of-distribution data, we'll create a modified version of TriviaQA by introducing adversarial examples and questions from different domains. We'll also use the AmbigQA dataset to test performance on ambiguous questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods for comparison: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Temperature scaling, 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: CCR Implementation": "Implement the CCR method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial answer and confidence prompt, b) Counterfactual scenario generation prompt, c) Confidence impact analysis prompt, d) Refined confidence estimation prompt.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of CCR and baseline methods: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Brier Score, 3) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for confidence-based classification, 4) Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and true confidences (for questions with known difficulty levels).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results, b) Run CCR method and collect results, c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and CCR methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare CCR performance against baselines across different datasets and models, b) Analyze the quality and diversity of generated counterfactual scenarios, c) Examine the relationship between the number of counterfactual scenarios and confidence refinement quality, d) Investigate the impact of CCR on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. ambiguous).",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each CCR step: a) Remove counterfactual scenario generation, b) Remove confidence impact analysis, c) Vary the number of counterfactual scenarios generated."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Answer and Confidence)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Answer and Confidence)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Counterfactual Scenario Generation)": "Generate three counterfactual scenarios that could change your answer or confidence level to the question: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Counterfactual Scenario Generation)": "1. If the Apollo 11 mission had failed, and a later mission had been the first to land on the moon.\n2. If historical records were discovered showing that a Soviet cosmonaut had secretly landed on the moon before the Apollo missions.\n3. If it was revealed that the moon landings were actually a hoax staged by NASA.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Confidence Impact Analysis)": "For each counterfactual scenario, explain how and why your confidence in the original answer would change.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Confidence Impact Analysis)": "1. If a later Apollo mission had been first, my confidence would decrease to 0% for Neil Armstrong being first, and increase for the actual first astronaut.\n2. If evidence of a secret Soviet landing emerged, my confidence would drop significantly, perhaps to 20%, as it would challenge the established historical narrative.\n3. If the moon landings were proven to be a hoax, my confidence would drop to 0%, as the entire basis for the original answer would be invalidated.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Refined Confidence Estimation)": "Given these counterfactual scenarios and their potential impact on your confidence, please provide a refined confidence estimate for your original answer that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Refined Confidence Estimation)": "Refined confidence: 85\nReasoning: While I remain highly confident that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon, considering these counterfactual scenarios has made me aware of potential, albeit unlikely, alternatives. The possibility of undiscovered historical records or misrepresented information, however remote, suggests that absolute certainty is unwarranted. The refined confidence of 85 reflects a high degree of certainty based on extensive historical documentation and widespread acceptance, while acknowledging the small possibility of unknown factors that could challenge this belief.",
            "Explanation": "The CCR method encourages the model to consider alternative scenarios and potential gaps in its knowledge, leading to a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated confidence estimate. In this case, the model slightly reduced its confidence from 95 to 85, demonstrating a more cautious approach after considering potential sources of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCR method does not significantly improve uncertainty estimation compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactual scenarios to understand why they didn't lead to improved calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of counterfactuals generated and their relevance to the questions. Second, we could investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply counterfactual reasoning for uncertainty estimation. Third, we could explore combining CCR with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, if the counterfactual generation itself proves valuable, we could refocus the project on using these counterfactuals to improve the robustness of the model's answers, rather than just calibrating confidence estimates."
