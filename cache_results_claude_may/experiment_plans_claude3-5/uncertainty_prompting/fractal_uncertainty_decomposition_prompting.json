        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods often treat uncertainty as a monolithic concept, failing to capture its multi-scale and hierarchical nature in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically provide single uncertainty scores or confidence intervals for model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by fractal geometry, we propose that uncertainty in LLM outputs can be decomposed into self-similar patterns at different scales of reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (FUDP). The LLM is prompted to break down its reasoning into increasingly fine-grained steps, assigning uncertainty scores at each level. The prompt structure is: 'Solve [problem X] by decomposing it into 3-5 sub-problems. For each sub-problem, provide a solution and an uncertainty score (0-100). Then, recursively decompose each sub-problem into 3-5 smaller sub-problems, again with solutions and uncertainty scores. Continue this process for 3 levels.' The final uncertainty is computed using a novel fractal dimension algorithm that considers the distribution and self-similarity of uncertainty scores across levels.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate FUDP against standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting on multi-step reasoning tasks from domains like math and logic. Compare the fractal uncertainty scores with human judgments of reasoning complexity and correctness."

        "Title": "Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting: Quantifying Multi-Scale Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for large language models (LLMs) often treat uncertainty as a monolithic concept, failing to capture its multi-scale and hierarchical nature in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret model confidence across different levels of reasoning granularity.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically provide single uncertainty scores or confidence intervals for model outputs, which may not adequately represent the nuanced nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning processes. Inspired by fractal geometry, we propose that uncertainty in LLM outputs can be decomposed into self-similar patterns at different scales of reasoning. This approach allows for a more comprehensive and granular understanding of model uncertainty, potentially leading to improved model interpretability and more reliable decision-making based on LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (FUDP), a novel method for quantifying uncertainty in LLM outputs. FUDP prompts the LLM to break down its reasoning into increasingly fine-grained steps, assigning uncertainty scores at each level. The prompt structure is: 'Solve [problem X] by decomposing it into 3-5 sub-problems. For each sub-problem, provide a solution and an uncertainty score (0-100). Then, recursively decompose each sub-problem into 3-5 smaller sub-problems, again with solutions and uncertainty scores. Continue this process for 3 levels.' The final uncertainty is computed using a novel fractal dimension algorithm that considers the distribution and self-similarity of uncertainty scores across levels.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select multi-step reasoning tasks from domains like math and logic. We will use the GSM8K dataset for math word problems and the LogiQA dataset for logical reasoning tasks. These datasets provide complex problems that require multi-step reasoning, making them suitable for our fractal uncertainty decomposition approach.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Standard prompting: directly ask the LLM to solve the problem and provide a single uncertainty score. (2) Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: ask the LLM to solve the problem step-by-step and provide an overall uncertainty score.",
            "Step 3: FUDP Implementation": "Implement the Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting method. For each problem, prompt the LLM to decompose the reasoning process into three levels of sub-problems, each with solutions and uncertainty scores.",
            "Step 4: Fractal Dimension Algorithm": "Develop and implement the fractal dimension algorithm to compute the final uncertainty score from the hierarchical uncertainty scores obtained through FUDP. This algorithm should consider the distribution and self-similarity of uncertainty scores across levels.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the datasets: (a) Apply standard prompting and record the solution and uncertainty score. (b) Apply CoT prompting and record the step-by-step solution and overall uncertainty score. (c) Apply FUDP and record the hierarchical solutions and uncertainty scores, then compute the final uncertainty using the fractal dimension algorithm.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3-5 domain experts to assess a subset of problems (50-100) from each dataset. Ask them to rate the complexity of each problem and the correctness of the solutions provided by each method.",
            "Step 8: Performance Analysis": "Compare the performance of FUDP against the baseline methods using the following metrics: (a) Solution accuracy (b) Correlation between uncertainty scores and solution correctness (c) Correlation between fractal uncertainty scores and human judgments of problem complexity",
            "Step 9: Qualitative Analysis": "Analyze a subset of examples to understand how FUDP captures uncertainty at different reasoning scales. Visualize the hierarchical uncertainty decomposition for these examples."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more apples and then gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does John have now? Also, provide an uncertainty score (0-100) for your answer, where 0 means completely certain and 100 means completely uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "Answer: John has 6 apples now. Uncertainty score: 10",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more apples and then gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does John have now? Please solve this step-by-step and provide an overall uncertainty score (0-100) for your answer, where 0 means completely certain and 100 means completely uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Step 1: John starts with 5 apples.\nStep 2: He buys 3 more apples, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 apples.\nStep 3: He gives 2 apples to his friend, so he now has 8 - 2 = 6 apples.\nFinal Answer: John has 6 apples now.\nUncertainty score: 5",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FUDP)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more apples and then gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does John have now? Solve this problem by decomposing it into 3-5 sub-problems. For each sub-problem, provide a solution and an uncertainty score (0-100). Then, recursively decompose each sub-problem into 3-5 smaller sub-problems, again with solutions and uncertainty scores. Continue this process for 3 levels.",

            "explanation": "FUDP provides a more detailed breakdown of the problem-solving process, revealing uncertainties at different levels of reasoning. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of where uncertainties arise in the reasoning process, which is not captured by the baseline methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed FUDP method does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the hierarchical uncertainty scores to identify patterns or insights about LLM reasoning processes. This could lead to a paper on the nature of uncertainty in LLM reasoning rather than a new method for uncertainty quantification. 2) Investigate whether certain types of problems or reasoning steps consistently produce higher uncertainty scores, which could inform targeted improvements in LLM training or prompting strategies. 3) Explore alternative algorithms for aggregating the hierarchical uncertainty scores, such as weighted averages or more complex statistical methods, to see if a different aggregation approach yields better results. 4) Analyze cases where FUDP performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines, which could provide insights into the strengths and limitations of hierarchical uncertainty decomposition. 5) Investigate the relationship between the fractal dimension of uncertainty scores and other metrics of problem complexity or difficulty, which could lead to new ways of characterizing and predicting LLM performance on complex tasks."
