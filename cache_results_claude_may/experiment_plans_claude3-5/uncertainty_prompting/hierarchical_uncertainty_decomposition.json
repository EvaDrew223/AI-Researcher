    "idea_name": "Hierarchical Uncertainty Decomposition",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overly simplistic uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the complex, multi-faceted nature of their knowledge and reasoning processes.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically output a single confidence score or a flat list of uncertainty factors.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often break down their uncertainty into hierarchical components, considering both high-level and granular sources of doubt. Mimicking this process could lead to more informative and actionable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hierarchical Uncertainty Decomposition (HUD), a prompting technique that guides the model to break down its uncertainty in a structured, tree-like manner. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Identify the main categories of uncertainty (e.g., 'factual knowledge', 'logical reasoning', 'contextual understanding'), 2) For each category, list specific sub-factors contributing to uncertainty, 3) Assign confidence scores at each level of the hierarchy, ensuring consistency between levels, 4) Provide an explanation for each score. This hierarchical approach allows for a more nuanced and interpretable representation of the model's uncertainty, capturing both broad and specific sources of doubt.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare HUD against flat confidence estimation techniques on complex reasoning tasks such as multi-hop question answering and logical deduction problems. Evaluate not only overall calibration metrics but also the informativeness and actionability of the uncertainty breakdowns. Conduct a human evaluation to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the hierarchical uncertainty representations."

        "Title": "Hierarchical Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide simplistic uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the complex, multi-faceted nature of their knowledge and reasoning processes. This limitation hinders the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically output a single confidence score or a flat list of uncertainty factors, which do not reflect the nuanced and hierarchical nature of human expert uncertainty assessment. Human experts often break down their uncertainty into hierarchical components, considering both high-level and granular sources of doubt. Mimicking this process in LLMs could lead to more informative and actionable uncertainty quantification, improving model transparency and enabling better decision-making based on model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hierarchical Uncertainty Decomposition (HUD), a prompting technique that guides the model to break down its uncertainty in a structured, tree-like manner. The HUD prompt instructs the model to: 1) Identify the main categories of uncertainty (e.g., 'factual knowledge', 'logical reasoning', 'contextual understanding'), 2) For each category, list specific sub-factors contributing to uncertainty, 3) Assign confidence scores at each level of the hierarchy, ensuring consistency between levels, 4) Provide an explanation for each score. This hierarchical approach allows for a more nuanced and interpretable representation of the model's uncertainty, capturing both broad and specific sources of doubt.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover different types of reasoning tasks: 1) TruthfulQA for factual knowledge, 2) LogiQA for logical reasoning, and 3) MMLU for multi-task understanding across various domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Flat uncertainty listing: Append 'List the top 3 factors contributing to your uncertainty in your answer.' to each question.",
            "Step 3: HUD Prompt Construction": "Develop the HUD prompt template: 'Answer the following question and then provide a hierarchical breakdown of your uncertainty:\n[QUESTION]\nAnswer: [MODEL GENERATES ANSWER]\nUncertainty Breakdown:\n1. Identify 3-5 main categories of uncertainty for this question.\n2. For each category, list 2-3 specific sub-factors contributing to uncertainty.\n3. Assign confidence scores (0-100) at each level of the hierarchy, ensuring consistency between levels.\n4. Provide a brief explanation for each score.\nEnsure that the overall confidence score is consistent with the hierarchical breakdown.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection and API Setup": "We will use GPT-4 and Claude-2 as our primary models, accessed through their respective APIs. Set up API access and implement functions to send prompts and receive responses.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and HUD), collect model responses. Implement error handling and rate limiting to manage API calls effectively.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics Implementation": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare model confidence to actual performance. 2) Sharpness: Measure the specificity of uncertainty estimates. 3) Hierarchical consistency: Ensure that sub-category confidences are consistent with higher-level confidences. 4) Informativeness: Assess the quality and relevance of uncertainty factors and explanations.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation Setup": "Prepare a subset of 100 examples from each dataset for human evaluation. Create an evaluation form that asks human raters to assess: 1) The relevance of identified uncertainty factors, 2) The consistency of the hierarchy, 3) The informativeness of the explanations, and 4) The overall usefulness of the uncertainty breakdown compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Results Analysis": "Compute and compare metrics across all methods. Perform statistical tests to determine the significance of any improvements. Analyze human evaluation results to assess the interpretability and usefulness of HUD compared to baselines.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing different components of the HUD prompt (e.g., removing the hierarchical structure, removing explanations) to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Confidence: 100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Flat Uncertainty Listing)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nList the top 3 factors contributing to your uncertainty in your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Flat Uncertainty Listing)": "1. No uncertainty in this case as it's a well-known fact.\n2. Potential for recent geopolitical changes (extremely unlikely).\n3. Possibility of misunderstanding the question (extremely low).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (HUD)": "Answer the following question and then provide a hierarchical breakdown of your uncertainty:\nQ: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: [MODEL GENERATES ANSWER]\nUncertainty Breakdown:\n1. Identify 3-5 main categories of uncertainty for this question.\n2. For each category, list 2-3 specific sub-factors contributing to uncertainty.\n3. Assign confidence scores (0-100) at each level of the hierarchy, ensuring consistency between levels.\n4. Provide a brief explanation for each score.\nEnsure that the overall confidence score is consistent with the hierarchical breakdown.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (HUD)": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nUncertainty Breakdown:\n\n1. Factual Knowledge (Confidence: 99)\n   a. General geographic knowledge (Confidence: 99)\n      Explanation: This is a widely known fact taught in basic geography.\n   b. Recent geopolitical changes (Confidence: 99.9)\n      Explanation: While theoretically possible, it's extremely unlikely that the capital has changed recently without my knowledge.\n\n2. Question Interpretation (Confidence: 99.5)\n   a. Clarity of the question (Confidence: 99.9)\n      Explanation: The question is straightforward and unambiguous.\n   b. Potential for trick questions (Confidence: 99)\n      Explanation: While unlikely, there's a small possibility this could be a trick question with a non-standard definition of 'capital'.\n\n3. Model's Knowledge Cutoff (Confidence: 99.8)\n   a. Recency of information (Confidence: 99.8)\n      Explanation: My knowledge cutoff is well after Paris became the capital, and it's highly unlikely to have changed since.\n\nOverall Confidence: 99\nExplanation: The overall confidence is very high due to the well-established nature of this fact. The small uncertainty mainly stems from the theoretical possibilities of recent changes or non-standard interpretations, which are extremely unlikely but not absolutely impossible.",
            "explanation": "The HUD method provides a more detailed and nuanced breakdown of uncertainty compared to the baselines. It captures different aspects of uncertainty, provides explanations, and maintains consistency across levels, offering a more comprehensive view of the model's confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed HUD method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of the generated uncertainty hierarchies to identify patterns or common failures. 2) Analyzing cases where HUD performs worse than baselines to understand if the added complexity is introducing noise. 3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from HUD than others. Based on these findings, we could refine the HUD prompt to address identified weaknesses, such as providing more specific guidance on category selection or score assignment. Alternatively, we could explore a hybrid approach that combines elements of flat uncertainty listing with hierarchical decomposition. If the hierarchical structure proves problematic, we could pivot to a 'Guided Uncertainty Decomposition' approach that maintains the detailed breakdown and explanations but removes the strict hierarchical requirement. This analysis could yield valuable insights into the nature of LLM uncertainty representation, potentially leading to a paper on the challenges and limitations of extracting structured uncertainty estimates from these models."
