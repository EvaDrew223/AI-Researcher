        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas where their knowledge is limited or uncertain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs, which may not accurately capture the model's awareness of its knowledge boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically probing the model's knowledge boundaries through hypothetical scenarios, we can obtain a more accurate picture of where the model's confidence should decrease.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hypothetical Knowledge Boundary Probing (HKBP), a technique that explores the limits of the model's knowledge through a series of increasingly speculative prompts. The method involves: 1) Starting with a base question in a particular domain. 2) Generating a series of follow-up questions that progressively move towards the hypothetical edges of that domain. 3) Prompting the model to answer these questions and provide confidence estimates. 4) Analyzing the pattern of confidence decay across this spectrum of questions. 5) Using this pattern to calibrate the model's uncertainty estimates for the original question and similar queries. For example, in a historical domain, we might start with a factual question about a well-known event, then progress to questions about more obscure details, alternative historical scenarios, and finally to completely hypothetical events. This approach helps to map out the model's confidence landscape and identify the points where its knowledge becomes uncertain.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate HKBP across a range of domains including history, science, and current events. We'll compare it to standard confidence elicitation methods and other uncertainty quantification techniques. Evaluation will focus on the accuracy of calibrated uncertainty estimates, the model's ability to identify knowledge boundaries, and the interpretability of the confidence decay patterns."

        "Title": "Hypothetical Knowledge Boundary Probing: Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas where their knowledge is limited or uncertain. This issue can result in the propagation of misinformation and reduce the reliability of LLM-based systems in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs, which may not accurately capture the model's awareness of its knowledge boundaries. By systematically probing the model's knowledge boundaries through hypothetical scenarios, we can obtain a more accurate picture of where the model's confidence should decrease. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where we often test the limits of our knowledge by considering increasingly speculative scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hypothetical Knowledge Boundary Probing (HKBP), a technique that explores the limits of the model's knowledge through a series of increasingly speculative prompts. The method involves five key steps: 1) Starting with a base question in a particular domain. 2) Generating a series of follow-up questions that progressively move towards the hypothetical edges of that domain. 3) Prompting the model to answer these questions and provide confidence estimates. 4) Analyzing the pattern of confidence decay across this spectrum of questions. 5) Using this pattern to calibrate the model's uncertainty estimates for the original question and similar queries.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a diverse set of base questions across multiple domains (e.g., history, science, current events). For each base question, manually craft a series of 5-7 follow-up questions that progressively move towards more speculative or hypothetical scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Choose GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo as the primary models for evaluation. Also include Claude-2 from Anthropic as a comparison point.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Ensemble disagreement: Use multiple completions and measure the variance in responses as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: HKBP Implementation": "For each base question and its follow-ups: a) Prompt the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. b) Record the answer and confidence score for each question in the series. c) Analyze the pattern of confidence decay across the series.",
            "Step 5: Calibration Function Development": "Develop a function that takes the confidence decay pattern as input and outputs a calibrated uncertainty estimate for the original question. This could involve fitting a curve to the decay pattern and extrapolating back to the base question.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare the calibrated uncertainty estimates from HKBP with the baselines on a held-out test set. Metrics should include calibration error, Brier score, and qualitative analysis of cases where HKBP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of confidence decay patterns across different domains. b) Identification of question types or domains where HKBP is particularly effective or ineffective. c) Analysis of cases where the model's confidence doesn't decay as expected, potentially indicating areas of overconfidence."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the 16th President of the United States?\nA: The 16th President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln.\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Expected Output": "I am 100% confident in my answer that Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for confidence, which often results in overconfidence for well-known facts."
            },
            "HKBP Method Example": {
                "Input": "Base Q: Who was the 16th President of the United States?\nFollow-up Q1: What was Abraham Lincoln's favorite book?\nFollow-up Q2: How many times did Lincoln read 'The Iliad' during his presidency?\nFollow-up Q3: If Lincoln had lived to age 80, what would have been his last public speech about?\nFollow-up Q4: In an alternate timeline where Lincoln declined the presidency, who would have been elected instead?\nFollow-up Q5: How would Lincoln have approached the invention of the telephone if he had lived to see it?\nFor each question, provide an answer and a confidence score from 0-100.",
                "Expected Output": "Base Q: Abraham Lincoln. Confidence: 100\nQ1: While Lincoln was known to enjoy reading, especially Shakespeare, there's no definitive record of his absolute favorite book. Confidence: 70\nQ2: There's no historical record of how many times Lincoln read 'The Iliad' during his presidency, if at all. Confidence: 30\nQ3: This is purely speculative. Lincoln might have addressed issues of his time, but it's impossible to know for certain. Confidence: 10\nQ4: This is an alternate history scenario. While we can speculate based on other prominent figures of the time, there's no way to know for certain. Confidence: 5\nQ5: This is highly speculative. While we can make educated guesses based on Lincoln's character and the impact of the telephone, it's impossible to know for certain. Confidence: 3",
                "Explanation": "HKBP shows a clear decay in confidence as questions become more speculative, providing a more nuanced picture of the model's uncertainty."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed HKBP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of where and why HKBP fails, which could provide valuable insights into the nature of LLM knowledge boundaries. This could involve categorizing different types of knowledge decay patterns and relating them to specific domains or question types. Second, we could explore combining HKBP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it to refine estimates from ensemble methods. Finally, we could investigate whether the process of generating hypothetical questions itself provides useful information about model uncertainty, potentially leading to a new method of probing LLM knowledge boundaries."
