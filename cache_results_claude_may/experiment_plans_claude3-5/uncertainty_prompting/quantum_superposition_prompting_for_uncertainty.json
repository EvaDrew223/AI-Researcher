        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often struggle to capture the full spectrum of possible responses and their associated uncertainties, especially for complex queries with multiple valid interpretations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on sampling-based methods or direct confidence estimation, which may not fully capture the nuanced landscape of potential responses.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by quantum mechanics, we propose to treat LLM responses as existing in a superposition of states until 'observed', allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of the response space and associated uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), a novel technique that generates multiple 'superposed' responses to a given query. The prompt instructs the LLM to generate n distinct responses, each with an associated 'amplitude' representing its likelihood. These responses are then 'collapsed' through a series of follow-up prompts that act as 'measurements', refining the uncertainty estimates. The final uncertainty is derived from the distribution of amplitudes across the surviving responses.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare QSP against traditional sampling methods and direct confidence estimation on a range of tasks, including open-ended question answering and ambiguous instruction following. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, uncertainty coverage, and task-specific performance measures."

        "Title": "Quantum Superposition Prompting: A Novel Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to capture the full spectrum of possible responses and their associated uncertainties, especially for complex queries with multiple valid interpretations. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on sampling-based methods or direct confidence estimation, which may not fully capture the nuanced landscape of potential responses. Inspired by quantum mechanics, we propose to treat LLM responses as existing in a superposition of states until 'observed', allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of the response space and associated uncertainties. This approach leverages the LLM's inherent ability to generate diverse responses and self-evaluate, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), a novel technique that generates multiple 'superposed' responses to a given query. The process involves three main steps: 1) Generation of superposed states: The LLM is prompted to generate n distinct responses, each with an associated 'amplitude' representing its likelihood. 2) Measurement through follow-up prompts: These responses are then 'collapsed' through a series of follow-up prompts that act as 'measurements', refining the uncertainty estimates. 3) Uncertainty derivation: The final uncertainty is derived from the distribution of amplitudes across the surviving responses.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, 2) AmbigNQ for ambiguous queries, and 3) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving. These datasets cover a range of tasks where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Monte Carlo Dropout, 2) Deep Ensembles, and 3) Temperature Scaling. For each method, use the LLM API to generate multiple responses and estimate uncertainties.",
            "Step 3: QSP Implementation": "Implement the Quantum Superposition Prompting method. The prompt for generating superposed states will be: 'Generate {n} distinct responses to the following query, each with an associated probability (0-1) representing your confidence: {query}'. For the measurement step, use: 'Given these responses, provide follow-up questions to disambiguate or verify the answers. Then, update the probabilities based on how well each response answers these questions.'",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration Error, 2) Brier Score, 3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 4) Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), and 5) task-specific performance measures (e.g., F1 score for QA tasks).",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and QSP): 1) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates for all queries. 2) Calculate all evaluation metrics. 3) Repeat the process 5 times with different random seeds to ensure robustness.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1) Compare QSP against baselines using paired t-tests on each metric. 2) Analyze how the number of superposed states (n) affects performance. 3) Investigate the nature of the follow-up questions generated in the measurement step. 4) Examine cases where QSP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Query: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output (Monte Carlo Dropout)": "Paris (confidence: 0.95)",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single answer with a high confidence, potentially overlooking alternative interpretations or sources of uncertainty."
            },
            "QSP Example": {
                "Input": "Query: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output Step 1 (Superposition)": "1. Paris (amplitude: 0.8), 2. Versailles (amplitude: 0.1), 3. The administrative capital is Paris, but Versailles was historically significant (amplitude: 0.1)",
                "Output Step 2 (Measurement)": "Follow-up questions: 1. Are we referring to the current capital or a historical one? 2. Is there a distinction between administrative and cultural capitals?",
                "Output Step 3 (Final)": "Paris (uncertainty: 0.2), with the uncertainty stemming from potential historical or cultural interpretations of 'capital'",
                "Explanation": "QSP generates multiple responses, considers potential ambiguities, and provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate that captures the complexity of the question."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If QSP does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct an in-depth analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Examining the diversity and relevance of the generated superposed states to ensure they're capturing meaningful variations. 2) Analyzing the effectiveness of the measurement step in refining probabilities. 3) Investigating whether the method is more effective for certain types of queries or domains. Based on these insights, we could modify the prompting strategy, experiment with different ways of collapsing the superposition, or explore hybrid approaches that combine QSP with traditional uncertainty estimation methods. Additionally, we could pivot to focus on the interpretability benefits of QSP, analyzing how the superposed states and measurement process provide insight into the model's reasoning and sources of uncertainty, even if they don't always lead to more accurate uncertainty estimates."
