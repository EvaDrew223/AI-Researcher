    "idea_name": "Confidence Horizon Mapping",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their confidence across different knowledge domains and task complexities, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or token probability analysis, which can be unreliable or computationally expensive.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of event horizons in physics, we propose that an LLM's confidence can be more accurately gauged by probing the boundaries of its knowledge and capabilities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Horizon Mapping (CHM), a novel prompting technique that iteratively pushes the model to generate increasingly complex or obscure information related to the initial query. The process continues until the model reaches a 'confidence horizon' where it can no longer provide coherent responses. By analyzing the trajectory of responses leading up to this horizon, we can derive a more nuanced and accurate confidence estimate. The prompting process involves three key steps: 1) Initial query response, 2) Iterative complexity scaling (e.g., 'Provide a more advanced explanation of...'), and 3) Horizon detection (e.g., 'If you're unsure about any part of your last response, please specify'). The confidence score is then calculated based on the number of successful iterations and the coherence degradation rate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CHM against standard confidence elicitation methods on a diverse set of tasks including factual QA, reasoning problems, and domain-specific queries. Metrics will include calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human expert confidence ratings. We'll also analyze the method's robustness across different model sizes and architectures."

        "Title": "Confidence Horizon Mapping: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Iterative Complexity Scaling",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their confidence across different knowledge domains and task complexities, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones. This issue is particularly problematic in high-stakes applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial for decision-making and trust.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or token probability analysis, which can be unreliable or computationally expensive. Inspired by the concept of event horizons in physics, we propose that an LLM's confidence can be more accurately gauged by probing the boundaries of its knowledge and capabilities. This approach leverages the model's own ability to generate increasingly complex information, potentially providing a more nuanced and accurate measure of confidence across diverse tasks and domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Horizon Mapping (CHM), a novel prompting technique that iteratively pushes the model to generate increasingly complex or obscure information related to the initial query. The process continues until the model reaches a 'confidence horizon' where it can no longer provide coherent responses.

The confidence score is then calculated based on the number of successful iterations and the coherence degradation rate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare a diverse set of tasks including factual QA (e.g., TriviaQA), reasoning problems (e.g., MMLU), and domain-specific queries (e.g., scientific papers from arXiv). Ensure a balanced distribution of easy, medium, and difficult questions across various domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence elicitation methods: a) Direct confidence scoring: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. b) Token probability analysis: Use the model's output probabilities to calculate perplexity as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: CHM Implementation": "Develop the Confidence Horizon Mapping algorithm: a) Initial response: Generate an answer to the original query. b) Complexity scaling: Implement a function to generate increasingly complex follow-up questions (e.g., 'Explain [previous answer] in more technical terms'). c) Horizon detection: Implement a function to detect when the model reaches its confidence horizon (e.g., 'If any part of your last response is uncertain, please specify').",
            "Step 4: Confidence Score Calculation": "Develop a scoring function that considers: a) Number of successful complexity scaling iterations. b) Rate of coherence degradation (e.g., using perplexity or embedding similarity between consecutive responses). c) Explicit uncertainty statements from the horizon detection step.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for primary experiments. Include Claude from Anthropic API for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each task in the dataset: a) Run baseline methods to get confidence estimates. b) Run CHM to get confidence estimates. c) Store all intermediate responses and metrics for analysis.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Compare CHM against baselines using: a) Calibration error: Plot predicted confidence vs. empirical accuracy. b) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Correlation with human expert confidence ratings: Recruit domain experts to rate a subset of model responses and correlate with CHM scores.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "a) Compare CHM performance across different task types and domains. b) Analyze the relationship between the number of complexity scaling iterations and task difficulty. c) Investigate cases where CHM significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CHM; Step 1: Initial Query)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CHM; Step 1: Initial Query)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CHM; Step 2: Complexity Scaling)": "Provide a more detailed explanation about the history and significance of Paris as the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CHM; Step 2: Complexity Scaling)": "Paris has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages. It became the official capital in 987 when Hugh Capet, the Count of Paris, became King of France. The city's strategic location on the Seine River made it an important center of trade and politics. Over the centuries, Paris grew in importance, becoming a center of art, culture, and intellectual life during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. The French Revolution in the late 18th century further cemented Paris's role as the heart of French politics and national identity. Today, Paris continues to be the political, economic, and cultural center of France, housing major government institutions, international organizations, and world-renowned landmarks.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CHM; Step 3: Horizon Detection)": "If you're unsure about any part of your last response, please specify.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CHM; Step 3: Horizon Detection)": "I'm confident about the general historical facts and significance of Paris as the capital of France as stated in my previous response. However, I want to clarify that while Hugh Capet becoming King in 987 was a significant moment, the concept of an 'official' capital as we understand it today wasn't fully established at that time. The process of Paris becoming the undisputed capital was gradual and evolved over centuries.",
            "Explanation": "The CHM method allows for a more nuanced assessment of the model's confidence. While the baseline method shows high confidence for a simple fact, CHM reveals areas of uncertainty when pushed to provide more detailed information. This approach can better distinguish between surface-level knowledge and deeper understanding, providing a more accurate measure of the model's true confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CHM method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the complexity scaling trajectories to identify patterns in how LLMs approach their knowledge boundaries. This could provide insights into model behavior and potential improvements in training or prompting strategies. 2) Investigate the relationship between task type and the effectiveness of CHM. It may be that certain types of tasks benefit more from this approach, which could lead to a hybrid confidence estimation system. 3) Explore variations of the CHM method, such as using different types of complexity scaling questions or alternative horizon detection techniques. 4) Analyze cases where CHM performs poorly to identify potential weaknesses in the method and propose improvements. 5) Compare the CHM trajectories across different model sizes and architectures to gain insights into how model capacity relates to confidence horizons. These alternative directions could still yield valuable contributions to the field of uncertainty quantification in LLMs."
