    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to recognize their own biases and limitations, leading to overconfidence in areas where their knowledge is incomplete or biased.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on the model's primary knowledge base without explicitly considering alternative worldviews or knowledge frameworks.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to consider contrasting worldviews or knowledge frameworks, we can reveal areas of uncertainty that might not be apparent from a single perspective.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Worldview Exploration (CWE), a method that estimates uncertainty by comparing responses across different simulated worldviews. First, we prompt the LLM to generate several contrasting worldviews or knowledge frameworks relevant to the input query. For each worldview, we then prompt the model to respond to the query as if that worldview were true. The uncertainty is estimated based on the divergence of responses across these worldviews. High divergence indicates high uncertainty, as it suggests the model's response is highly dependent on underlying assumptions or biases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CWE on tasks involving cultural, historical, or scientific knowledge where multiple valid perspectives exist. Compare with standard uncertainty estimation methods in terms of calibration and ability to identify biased or incomplete knowledge. Assess the method's effectiveness in improving model performance on tasks requiring multicultural or interdisciplinary understanding."

        "Title": "Contrastive Worldview Exploration: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Perspective Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to recognize their own biases and limitations, leading to overconfidence in areas where their knowledge is incomplete or biased. This overconfidence can result in the generation of inaccurate or misleading information, potentially causing harm in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically focus on the model's primary knowledge base without explicitly considering alternative worldviews or knowledge frameworks. By prompting the model to consider contrasting worldviews or knowledge frameworks, we can reveal areas of uncertainty that might not be apparent from a single perspective. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where considering multiple viewpoints often leads to a more nuanced understanding of complex issues.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Worldview Exploration (CWE), a method that estimates uncertainty by comparing responses across different simulated worldviews. The process involves three main steps: 1) Worldview Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate several contrasting worldviews or knowledge frameworks relevant to the input query. 2) Multi-Perspective Response Generation: For each worldview, prompt the model to respond to the query as if that worldview were true. 3) Uncertainty Estimation: Calculate the uncertainty based on the divergence of responses across these worldviews. High divergence indicates high uncertainty, as it suggests the model's response is highly dependent on underlying assumptions or biases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that cover a range of topics where multiple valid perspectives exist. We will use: 1) Cultural Understanding Dataset: A subset of questions from the Cultural and Ethical Reasoning benchmark in BIG-bench. 2) Historical Interpretation Dataset: A curated set of questions about historical events with multiple interpretations. 3) Scientific Controversy Dataset: Questions about ongoing scientific debates from the ScienceQA dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods for comparison: 1) Softmax Probability: Use the softmax probability of the top prediction as a confidence score. 2) Entropy of Output Distribution: Calculate the entropy of the output token distribution. 3) Ensemble Disagreement: Use multiple forward passes with different random seeds and measure disagreement.",
            "Step 3: CWE Implementation": "Implement the Contrastive Worldview Exploration method: 1) Worldview Generation Prompt: 'Generate {n} distinct worldviews or perspectives relevant to answering the following question: {question}' 2) Multi-Perspective Response Generation Prompt: 'Given the worldview: {worldview}, answer the following question: {question}' 3) Uncertainty Estimation: Calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the response distributions for each worldview.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Also include open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: 1) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates using baseline methods. 2) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates using CWE. 3) Store all responses and uncertainty scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "1) Accuracy: Compare the accuracy of the final answers from CWE and baselines. 2) Calibration: Assess how well the uncertainty estimates correlate with actual error rates. 3) Bias Detection: Evaluate the method's ability to identify questions where the model's knowledge is biased or incomplete.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare CWE performance against baselines across different types of questions and topics. 2) Analyze cases where CWE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. 3) Examine the generated worldviews and their impact on final uncertainty estimates."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What were the primary causes of World War I?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The primary causes of World War I were: 1) Nationalism and imperialism among European powers, 2) The alliance system that divided Europe into opposing camps, 3) Militarism and arms races, 4) The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Worldview Generation)": "Generate 3 distinct worldviews or perspectives relevant to answering the following question: What were the primary causes of World War I?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Worldview Generation)": "1. European-centric view: Focuses on the complex web of alliances and tensions between European powers. 2. Economic perspective: Emphasizes economic competition and imperialism as driving forces. 3. Individual-focused view: Highlights the role of key political figures and their decisions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Multi-Perspective Response Generation)": "Given the worldview: Economic perspective that emphasizes economic competition and imperialism as driving forces, answer the following question: What were the primary causes of World War I?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Multi-Perspective Response Generation)": "From an economic perspective, the primary causes of World War I were: 1) Economic imperialism and competition for colonial resources, 2) Industrial revolution leading to arms races and military-industrial complexes, 3) Trade rivalries and protectionist policies between European powers, 4) Financial entanglements and debts between nations that increased tensions.",
            "Explanation": "The CWE method generates multiple perspectives, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the complex factors behind World War I. This approach reveals potential biases in the initial response and highlights areas of uncertainty, such as the relative importance of economic factors versus political alliances."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CWE method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty estimation, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on the limitations of LLMs in handling multi-perspective reasoning. We would analyze: 1) The quality and diversity of generated worldviews, 2) How different worldviews affect the model's responses, 3) The model's ability to maintain consistency across different perspectives. This analysis could provide insights into the model's reasoning processes and biases, potentially informing future approaches to improving LLM performance on complex, multi-faceted questions. Additionally, we could explore combining CWE with other uncertainty estimation methods or investigate its effectiveness in improving the model's responses through a refinement process, where the model is prompted to synthesize insights from multiple worldviews."
