        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their confidence across diverse domains and question types, leading to inconsistent uncertainty quantification.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use fixed prompting strategies or fine-tuning on specific uncertainty estimation tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from metamorphic testing in software engineering, where inputs are transformed to reveal hidden properties, we can apply similar principles to uncertainty estimation in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metamorphic Uncertainty Reflection (MUR), a dynamic prompting strategy that systematically transforms the input question across multiple dimensions (e.g., specificity, abstraction level, domain shift) while preserving its core meaning. For each transformation, the LLM is prompted to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The method then analyzes the consistency and variance of these estimates across transformations to derive a more robust uncertainty measure. Additionally, the LLM is asked to reflect on and explain any discrepancies in its confidence across transformations, encouraging meta-cognitive awareness.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MUR against static confidence elicitation methods on a diverse set of questions spanning multiple domains. Measure performance using calibration plots, Brier scores, and correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different types of metamorphic transformations."

        "Title": "Metamorphic Uncertainty Reflection: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their confidence across diverse domains and question types, leading to inconsistent uncertainty quantification. This inconsistency can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate confidence estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on fixed prompting strategies or fine-tuning on specific uncertainty estimation tasks. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced variations in model confidence across different contexts and question formulations. Drawing inspiration from metamorphic testing in software engineering, where inputs are transformed to reveal hidden properties, we propose a novel method to dynamically assess and calibrate LLM uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about its own outputs across systematically varied inputs, potentially leading to more robust and context-aware uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Uncertainty Reflection (MUR), a dynamic prompting strategy that systematically transforms the input question across multiple dimensions (e.g., specificity, abstraction level, domain shift) while preserving its core meaning. For each transformation, the LLM is prompted to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The method then analyzes the consistency and variance of these estimates across transformations to derive a more robust uncertainty measure. Additionally, the LLM is asked to reflect on and explain any discrepancies in its confidence across transformations, encouraging meta-cognitive awareness. The steps of MUR are as follows: 1) Generate question transformations, 2) Obtain answers and confidence estimates for each transformation, 3) Analyze consistency and variance of estimates, 4) Prompt for reflection on discrepancies, 5) Synthesize final uncertainty measure.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse set of questions from multiple domains, including general knowledge, science, and reasoning tasks. We will use a combination of existing datasets such as TriviaQA, SciQ, and BoolQ, supplemented with custom questions to ensure diversity. Create a test set of 1000 questions spanning these domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the model 'How confident are you in your answer?' after each response. b) Calibrated softmax: Use the softmax probabilities of the output tokens as a proxy for confidence. c) Ensemble method: Use multiple forward passes with different prompts and calculate the variance in responses as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: MUR Implementation": "Implement the MUR method with the following sub-steps: a) Question Transformation: Develop prompts to generate 5 transformations for each question (e.g., 'Rephrase this question to be more specific:', 'Generalize this question:'). b) Confidence Elicitation: For each transformation and the original question, prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100). c) Discrepancy Analysis: Prompt the model to explain any significant differences in confidence scores across transformations. d) Uncertainty Synthesis: Develop an algorithm to combine the confidence scores and discrepancy analysis into a final uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. Additionally, we will test on open-source models like FLAN-T5 and LLaMA-2 to assess generalizability.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of MUR against baseline methods using the following metrics: a) Calibration plots: Plot predicted confidence vs. empirical accuracy. b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and empirical accuracy. c) Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. d) Correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings: Have human experts rate their uncertainty on a subset of 100 questions and compare with model estimates.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of MUR: a) Vary the number of transformations (1, 3, 5, 7) to find the optimal balance between performance and computational cost. b) Test different methods of synthesizing the final uncertainty measure (e.g., mean, median, weighted average based on similarity to original question). c) Evaluate the impact of the discrepancy reflection step by comparing performance with and without this component.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: a) Identify domains or question types where MUR shows the most significant improvements. b) Analyze patterns in the model's explanations for confidence discrepancies. c) Investigate cases where MUR performs worse than baselines to understand limitations.",
            "Step 8: Reporting": "Compile results into tables and figures for clear visualization of performance comparisons. Prepare detailed documentation of the method, experimental setup, and findings."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in my answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MUR Step 1: Question Transformation)": "Generate 3 transformations of the following question while preserving its core meaning: 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MUR Step 1: Question Transformation)": "1. Which city serves as the political and administrative center of the French Republic?\n2. What is the most populous city and seat of government in France?\n3. If you were to visit the Eiffel Tower, in which capital city would you be?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MUR Step 2: Confidence Elicitation)": "Answer each of the following questions and provide a confidence score (0-100) for your answer:\n1. What is the capital of France?\n2. Which city serves as the political and administrative center of the French Republic?\n3. What is the most populous city and seat of government in France?\n4. If you were to visit the Eiffel Tower, in which capital city would you be?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MUR Step 2: Confidence Elicitation)": "1. The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100\n2. The city that serves as the political and administrative center of the French Republic is Paris. Confidence: 100\n3. The most populous city and seat of government in France is Paris. Confidence: 98\n4. If you were to visit the Eiffel Tower, you would be in Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MUR Step 3: Discrepancy Analysis)": "Explain any differences in your confidence scores for the answers to the previous questions about the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MUR Step 3: Discrepancy Analysis)": "The slight difference in confidence (98 vs 100) for the question about the most populous city is due to a small degree of uncertainty about current population statistics. While Paris is definitely the capital and seat of government, there's a tiny chance that another French city might have surpassed it in population recently. However, this is highly unlikely, hence the still very high confidence of 98.",
            "explanation": "The MUR method provides a more nuanced assessment of the model's confidence by considering multiple formulations of the question and prompting for explicit reflection on confidence discrepancies. This approach can potentially capture subtle uncertainties that might be missed by simpler confidence elicitation methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUR method does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why MUR is not improving uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing types of questions where MUR performs poorly and analyzing patterns in the generated transformations and reflections. 2) Explore combining MUR with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as using it as a feature in a machine learning model trained to predict uncertainty. 3) Investigate whether the information generated by MUR (question transformations, confidence discrepancies, reflections) can be useful for other tasks, such as improving answer quality or generating more informative responses. 4) Shift focus to analyzing how different LLMs perform in generating question transformations and reflecting on their own uncertainty, which could provide insights into the models' reasoning capabilities and limitations. This could turn the project into an analysis paper on LLM metacognition rather than a method paper on uncertainty estimation."
