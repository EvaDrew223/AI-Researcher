        "Title": "Uncertainty Cascade Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex tasks involving multiple steps of reasoning. This leads to overconfident predictions on incorrect answers, which can be dangerous in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods often fail to capture fine-grained uncertainties in multi-step reasoning. Inspired by how humans break down complex problems and assess uncertainty at each step, we propose a method to decompose tasks and propagate uncertainty through the reasoning chain. This approach should better capture the compounding nature of uncertainties in multi-step reasoning, leading to more accurate overall confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Cascade Prompting, which involves four main steps: 1) Task decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the task into subtasks. 2) Subtask uncertainty quantification: For each subtask, prompt the model to provide an answer and quantify its uncertainty. 3) Uncertainty propagation: Prompt the model to combine subtask uncertainties, considering how errors might compound. 4) Final confidence calibration: Based on the propagated uncertainty, prompt the model to calibrate its overall confidence in the final answer.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K (for math word problems) and MATH (for more advanced mathematical reasoning). Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to solve the problem and provide a confidence score. 2) Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: Use standard CoT prompting and ask for a final confidence score. 3) Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs with different prompts and calculate the variance in answers as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Uncertainty Cascade Prompting Implementation": "Implement the four steps of Uncertainty Cascade Prompting: 1) Task decomposition prompt: 'Break down this problem into smaller subtasks:' 2) Subtask uncertainty prompt: 'Solve this subtask and rate your confidence from 0-100%:' 3) Uncertainty propagation prompt: 'Given these subtask confidences, estimate the overall confidence:' 4) Final calibration prompt: 'Based on your reasoning and propagated uncertainty, what is your final answer and overall confidence?'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo to assess performance differences.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Percentage of correctly solved problems. 2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure of calibration quality. 3) Brier score: Combines calibration and resolution aspects of probabilistic predictions. 4) Confidence-performance curves: Plot accuracy as a function of confidence.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run all baseline methods and the Uncertainty Cascade Prompting method on the test set. 2) Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method. 3) Generate confidence-performance curves.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of Uncertainty Cascade Prompting against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze how well the method captures uncertainty in different types of reasoning tasks. 3) Investigate cases where the method significantly improves or fails compared to baselines. 4) Examine the quality and coherence of the decomposed subtasks and propagated uncertainties."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does John have now? Also, rate your confidence in your answer from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "John has 6 apples now. My confidence in this answer is 95%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Q: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more. How many apples does John have now? Break down this problem into smaller subtasks:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "1. Calculate how many apples John has after giving some to his friend.\n2. Add the number of apples John buys to the remaining apples.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 2: Subtask Uncertainty)": "Solve each subtask and rate your confidence from 0-100%:\n1. Calculate how many apples John has after giving some to his friend.\n2. Add the number of apples John buys to the remaining apples.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 2: Subtask Uncertainty)": "1. John has 5 apples and gives 2 to his friend. 5 - 2 = 3 apples remaining. Confidence: 100%\n2. John has 3 apples and buys 3 more. 3 + 3 = 6 apples total. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Given these subtask confidences, estimate the overall confidence:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Both subtasks have 100% confidence. Since the problem involves simple arithmetic with no ambiguous elements, the overall confidence remains high. Estimated overall confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 4: Final Calibration)": "Based on your reasoning and propagated uncertainty, what is your final answer and overall confidence?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Cascade Prompting; Step 4: Final Calibration)": "Final answer: John has 6 apples now. Overall confidence: 99%",
            "explanation": "The Uncertainty Cascade Prompting method provides a more detailed and transparent reasoning process, allowing for better uncertainty quantification at each step. This leads to a more nuanced final confidence estimate compared to the baseline method, which may be prone to overconfidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Uncertainty Cascade Prompting method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can explore several alternatives: 1) Analyze the quality of task decompositions to see if they're appropriate and consistent across similar problems. If not, we could develop a more structured approach to task decomposition, possibly using few-shot examples. 2) Investigate the uncertainty propagation step to see if it's effectively capturing the compounding nature of uncertainties. We might need to develop more sophisticated prompts or even a simple mathematical model for combining uncertainties. 3) Examine cases where the method performs poorly and look for patterns. This could inform the development of task-specific prompting strategies. 4) If the issue seems to be with the model's fundamental ability to estimate uncertainties, we could explore combining our method with external calibration techniques, turning the project into a hybrid approach that leverages both prompting and statistical post-processing methods."
