        "Problem": "Current LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple plausible answers exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like confidence elicitation and sample consistency methods have shown limited success in accurately calibrating model confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by information theory, we hypothesize that the entropy of an LLM's output distribution can be leveraged to guide a dynamic prompt refinement process, leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Entropy-Guided Prompt Refinement (EGPR), a novel prompting technique that iteratively refines the input prompt based on the entropy of the model's output distribution. The process begins with a base prompt and generates multiple candidate answers. We then calculate the entropy of this distribution. If the entropy is high (indicating high uncertainty), we automatically generate follow-up questions that target the areas of highest uncertainty. These questions are incorporated into an expanded prompt, and the process repeats until the entropy falls below a threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached. The final confidence score is derived from the inverse of the lowest achieved entropy.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate EGPR against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and sample consistency methods on a range of tasks including TriviaQA, SQuAD, and newly created ambiguous reasoning tasks. We'll measure performance using calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score."

        "Title": "Entropy-Guided Prompt Refinement for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple plausible answers exist. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions in scenarios where the model's knowledge is limited or ambiguous, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like confidence elicitation and sample consistency methods have shown limited success in accurately calibrating model confidence. These methods often rely on direct confidence estimation or statistical measures of output variability, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by information theory, we hypothesize that the entropy of an LLM's output distribution can be leveraged to guide a dynamic prompt refinement process, leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates. By iteratively refining the input prompt based on the model's uncertainty, we aim to encourage the model to explore areas of high uncertainty and provide more calibrated confidence scores.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Entropy-Guided Prompt Refinement (EGPR), a novel prompting technique that iteratively refines the input prompt based on the entropy of the model's output distribution. The process begins with a base prompt and generates multiple candidate answers. We then calculate the entropy of this distribution.

The final confidence score is derived from the inverse of the lowest achieved entropy.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: TriviaQA for factual question answering, SQuAD for reading comprehension, and a custom dataset of ambiguous reasoning tasks. For the custom dataset, create 100 questions with intentionally ambiguous or complex scenarios that require multi-step reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. (2) Sample consistency: Generate 10 samples for each question and calculate the agreement ratio. (3) Temperature scaling: Generate answers with different temperature settings and use the inverse of temperature that produces the most consistent answers as the confidence score.",
            "Step 3: EGPR Implementation": "Implement the EGPR method with the following steps: (1) Generate initial response: Use the base prompt to generate 5 candidate answers. (2) Calculate entropy: Compute the entropy of the distribution of these answers. (3) Generate follow-up questions: If entropy is above a threshold (e.g., 0.5), use the prompt 'Based on the given answers, what follow-up question would help clarify the areas of highest uncertainty?' to generate 3 follow-up questions. (4) Expand prompt: Incorporate the follow-up questions into the original prompt. (5) Repeat steps 1-4 until entropy falls below the threshold or max iterations (e.g., 5) is reached. (6) Calculate confidence: Use 1 - (final entropy / initial entropy) as the confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. Ensure API access and set up proper authentication.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (1) Run all baseline methods and EGPR. (2) For EGPR, log intermediate entropies, generated follow-up questions, and expanded prompts for analysis. (3) Generate final answers and confidence scores for all methods.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. (2) Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): Evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: (1) Compare EGPR against baselines using the evaluation metrics. (2) Analyze the relationship between initial entropy and final performance. (3) Examine the quality and relevance of generated follow-up questions. (4) Investigate how the number of refinement iterations affects performance. (5) Compare performance across different types of questions (factual vs. ambiguous reasoning)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for confidence, which may lead to overconfidence in simple factual questions."
            },
            "EGPR Example": {
                "Input": "Q: In a hypothetical scenario where global temperatures rise by 2\u00b0C, how would it affect polar bear populations?",
                "Step 1 Output": "Candidate answers: 1. Significant decline 2. Moderate decline 3. No significant change 4. Slight increase 5. Uncertain impact",
                "Step 2 Output": "Entropy: 0.72",
                "Step 3 Output": "Follow-up questions: 1. How does a 2\u00b0C temperature rise affect sea ice formation in polar regions? 2. What alternative food sources might polar bears adapt to in warmer conditions? 3. How quickly can polar bear populations adapt to changing environments?",
                "Step 4 Output": "Expanded prompt: Q: In a hypothetical scenario where global temperatures rise by 2\u00b0C, how would it affect polar bear populations? Consider the following: 1. How does a 2\u00b0C temperature rise affect sea ice formation in polar regions? 2. What alternative food sources might polar bears adapt to in warmer conditions? 3. How quickly can polar bear populations adapt to changing environments?",
                "Final Output": "A: Based on the additional considerations, the most likely outcome is a moderate decline in polar bear populations. A 2\u00b0C rise in global temperatures would significantly reduce sea ice formation in polar regions, which is crucial for polar bears' hunting and breeding. While some polar bears might adapt to alternative food sources on land, this adaptation would likely be insufficient to maintain current population levels. The rate of environmental change would likely outpace the polar bears' ability to adapt quickly enough. However, the extent of the decline could vary depending on specific regional factors and potential conservation efforts. Confidence: 68%",
                "Explanation": "EGPR generates follow-up questions to address areas of uncertainty, leading to a more nuanced answer with a more calibrated confidence score."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the EGPR method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand the limitations. This may include: (1) Examining the quality of generated follow-up questions to ensure they are relevant and informative. If not, we could explore few-shot prompting with high-quality examples to improve question generation. (2) Analyzing the entropy calculations to verify if they accurately reflect the model's uncertainty. We might consider alternative uncertainty measures, such as mutual information or predictive entropy. (3) Investigating the relationship between the number of refinement iterations and performance. If performance plateaus or degrades after a certain number of iterations, we could implement an adaptive stopping criterion. (4) Comparing performance across different question types to identify where EGPR succeeds or fails. This could lead to a hybrid approach that applies different methods based on question characteristics. (5) Exploring the impact of different prompt structures and wordings on the effectiveness of EGPR. We could conduct ablation studies on various prompt components to optimize the method. By addressing these aspects, we can gain valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of entropy-guided approaches, potentially leading to novel improvements in uncertainty quantification for LLMs."
