        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often fail to capture the nuanced relationship between task complexity and model confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches focus on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Human cognition exhibits varying levels of certainty based on task difficulty and cognitive load. By mimicking this process, we can potentially improve LLM uncertainty estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cognitive Load Uncertainty Prompting (CLUP), a multi-stage prompting technique that simulates increasing cognitive load to gauge model uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Task Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the given task into subtasks of increasing complexity. 2) Progressive Solving: Guide the LLM to solve these subtasks sequentially, prompting for confidence at each step. 3) Cognitive Load Simulation: Introduce artificial 'distractions' or 'time pressure' in the prompts as the subtasks progress. 4) Meta-Cognitive Analysis: Ask the LLM to reflect on its problem-solving process and identify points of uncertainty. 5) Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine the step-wise confidences and meta-cognitive analysis to produce a final uncertainty estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CLUP against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble disagreement on diverse tasks from TruthfulQA, MMLU, and GSM8K. Measure performance using calibration metrics (ECE, MCE) and correlation with human judgments of task difficulty."

        "Title": "Cognitive Load Uncertainty Prompting: Mimicking Human Cognition for Improved LLM Uncertainty Estimation",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the nuanced relationship between task complexity and model confidence. This limitation hinders the reliable assessment of model uncertainty, which is crucial for safe and trustworthy AI applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs. However, these methods often fall short in accurately reflecting the model's true uncertainty, especially for complex tasks. Human cognition exhibits varying levels of certainty based on task difficulty and cognitive load. By mimicking this process in LLMs, we can potentially improve uncertainty estimation, leading to more reliable and interpretable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cognitive Load Uncertainty Prompting (CLUP), a multi-stage prompting technique that simulates increasing cognitive load to gauge model uncertainty. The process involves five key steps: 1) Task Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the given task into subtasks of increasing complexity. 2) Progressive Solving: Guide the LLM to solve these subtasks sequentially, prompting for confidence at each step. 3) Cognitive Load Simulation: Introduce artificial 'distractions' or 'time pressure' in the prompts as the subtasks progress. 4) Meta-Cognitive Analysis: Ask the LLM to reflect on its problem-solving process and identify points of uncertainty. 5) Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine the step-wise confidences and meta-cognitive analysis to produce a final uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate CLUP: TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and honesty, MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for testing general knowledge across various domains, and GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K) for mathematical reasoning. These datasets offer a range of task complexities and domains, allowing us to thoroughly test our method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods for comparison: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the model to rate its confidence on a scale of 1-10 after generating an answer. 2) Ensemble disagreement: Use multiple model instances or sampling techniques to generate multiple answers and measure disagreement as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CLUP Implementation": "Implement the CLUP method as follows: a) Task Decomposition: For each question in the datasets, prompt the LLM to break it down into 3-5 subtasks of increasing complexity. b) Progressive Solving: Guide the LLM through each subtask, asking for a solution and a confidence score (1-10) for each. c) Cognitive Load Simulation: Introduce distractions by adding irrelevant information or time pressure cues (e.g., \"You have limited time to answer\") as the subtasks progress. d) Meta-Cognitive Analysis: After completing all subtasks, ask the LLM to reflect on its problem-solving process and identify points of uncertainty. e) Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine the step-wise confidences and meta-cognitive analysis using a weighted average to produce a final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CLUP against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between confidence and accuracy. 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE): Captures the worst-case miscalibration. 3) Brier Score: Assesses the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 4) Correlation with Human Judgments: We will use a small set of human-annotated difficulty scores for a subset of questions from each dataset to measure how well the model's uncertainty estimates correlate with human perceptions of task difficulty.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of CLUP performance against baselines across different task types and complexities. 2) Analysis of how the introduction of cognitive load affects uncertainty estimates. 3) Examination of the meta-cognitive analysis generated by the LLM and its impact on final uncertainty estimates. 4) Investigation of any patterns or trends in where the model expresses highest uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and then rate your confidence on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is least confident and 10 is most confident.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 10",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Ensemble Disagreement)": "Q: What is the capital of France? (Generate 5 responses)",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Ensemble Disagreement)": "1. The capital of France is Paris.\n2. Paris is the capital city of France.\n3. France's capital is Paris.\n4. The capital of France is Paris.\n5. Paris serves as the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLUP; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please break down this question into 3-5 subtasks of increasing complexity that would help answer the main question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLUP; Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "1. Recall the definition of a capital city.\n2. List some major cities in France.\n3. Identify which of these cities serves as the seat of government.\n4. Recall any historical information about France's capital.\n5. Consider any potential changes or disputes regarding the capital status.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLUP; Step 2: Progressive Solving)": "Now, let's solve each subtask. For each one, provide an answer and rate your confidence on a scale of 1-10. Subtask 1: Recall the definition of a capital city.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLUP; Step 2: Progressive Solving)": "Answer: A capital city is the primary city of a country, usually serving as the seat of government and often the largest or most important city economically and culturally. Confidence: 9/10",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLUP; Step 3: Cognitive Load Simulation)": "While considering the following distraction, please solve the next subtask. Distraction: Did you know that the Eiffel Tower was originally intended to be a temporary structure? Subtask 2: List some major cities in France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLUP; Step 3: Cognitive Load Simulation)": "Answer: Despite the interesting fact about the Eiffel Tower, I'll focus on the task. Some major cities in France include Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Nice. Confidence: 8/10",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLUP; Step 4: Meta-Cognitive Analysis)": "Now that you've completed all subtasks, please reflect on your problem-solving process. Identify any points where you felt uncertain and explain why.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLUP; Step 4: Meta-Cognitive Analysis)": "Throughout the process, I felt most confident about the definition of a capital city and identifying Paris as the capital of France. I experienced some uncertainty when listing major French cities, as I wasn't sure if I had included all the most significant ones. The historical information and potential disputes about the capital status introduced some minor uncertainty, as I had to consider whether there were any historical changes or current debates I might be unaware of. However, these uncertainties did not significantly impact the core answer to the main question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLUP; Step 5: Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Based on your step-wise confidence ratings and meta-cognitive analysis, provide a final answer to the original question 'What is the capital of France?' along with an overall uncertainty estimate on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is most uncertain and 10 is most certain.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLUP; Step 5: Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Overall Certainty: 9/10. While there were some minor uncertainties in the subtasks, the core fact of Paris being the capital of France remains highly certain based on its role as the seat of government and its historical and cultural significance.",
            "explanation": "CLUP provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by breaking down the task, simulating cognitive load, and encouraging meta-cognitive reflection. This process allows for a more detailed consideration of potential sources of uncertainty, which may not be captured by simpler methods like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble disagreement."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CLUP does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot our research focus to analyze why the method didn't meet expectations. We could investigate whether certain types of tasks or domains benefit more from CLUP than others, potentially leading to insights about when cognitive load simulation is most effective for uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we could analyze the intermediate outputs (task decomposition, progressive solving steps, and meta-cognitive analysis) to understand how LLMs approach uncertainty estimation. This could lead to a valuable analysis paper on the cognitive processes of LLMs in uncertainty estimation, even if the method itself doesn't improve overall performance. We might also consider modifying CLUP by adjusting the weighting of different components in the uncertainty aggregation step or experimenting with different types of cognitive load simulations to see if these changes improve performance."
