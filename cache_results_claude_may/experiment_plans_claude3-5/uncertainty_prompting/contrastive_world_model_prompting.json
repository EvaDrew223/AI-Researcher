        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately express uncertainty when their internal knowledge conflicts with given information or when facing ambiguous scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-perspective reasoning or simple ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting the model to reason from contrasting world models or belief systems, we can better capture epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflicts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive World Model Prompting (CWMP): 1) Given a query, prompt the model to generate responses from multiple contrasting world models or belief systems. 2) For each world model, include confidence estimates and key assumptions. 3) Prompt the model to compare and contrast these perspectives, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. 4) Finally, synthesize a final response with calibrated confidence levels based on the degree of consensus or conflict between world models. The prompts guide the model through each of these steps explicitly.",

        "Title": "Contrastive World Model Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately express uncertainty when their internal knowledge conflicts with given information or when facing ambiguous scenarios. This leads to overconfident responses in situations where the model should express doubt or provide more nuanced answers.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-perspective reasoning or simple ensemble methods, which may not fully capture the complexity of conflicting information or ambiguous scenarios. By explicitly prompting the model to reason from contrasting world models or belief systems, we can better capture epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflicts, leading to more calibrated and nuanced responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive World Model Prompting (CWMP), a multi-step prompting approach: 1) Given a query, prompt the model to generate responses from multiple contrasting world models or belief systems. 2) For each world model, include confidence estimates and key assumptions. 3) Prompt the model to compare and contrast these perspectives, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. 4) Finally, synthesize a final response with calibrated confidence levels based on the degree of consensus or conflict between world models. The prompts guide the model through each of these steps explicitly.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets that involve ambiguous or contentious topics. We will use a combination of questions from TruthfulQA, AmbigQA, and selected subsets of the MMLU dataset focusing on ethics, philosophy, and social sciences. Additionally, create a set of custom questions that specifically target scenarios with potential knowledge conflicts or high uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Simple ensemble method (averaging responses from multiple prompts), c) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models), d) Temperature scaling for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: CWMP Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of the CWMP method: a) World model generation prompt: \"Generate responses to [QUESTION] from three contrasting perspectives or belief systems. For each perspective, provide a confidence estimate (0-100%) and list key assumptions.\", b) Comparison prompt: \"Compare and contrast the perspectives generated for [QUESTION]. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement.\", c) Synthesis prompt: \"Based on the comparison of perspectives for [QUESTION], provide a final answer with a calibrated confidence level. Explain your reasoning.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API as the primary models for evaluation. Additionally, if computational resources allow, include Claude 2 from Anthropic and PaLM 2 from Google for a broader comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their outputs and confidence estimates. b) Apply the CWMP method, recording outputs from each step (world models, comparison, and final synthesis). c) For each method, collect multiple samples (e.g., 5-10) to account for output variability.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), b) Brier score, c) Area Under the Confidence-Accuracy Curve, d) F1 score for answer correctness (where applicable), e) Human evaluation of nuance and uncertainty expression (on a subset of responses).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare CWMP against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze how the number and diversity of world models affect performance. c) Investigate cases where CWMP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. d) Examine the relationship between inter-world model agreement and final confidence estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "What will be the long-term effects of artificial intelligence on employment?",
                "Baseline Output (Standard Prompting)": "The long-term effects of artificial intelligence on employment will be significant job displacement across many industries, leading to widespread unemployment and economic disruption.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a one-sided, overconfident prediction without acknowledging the uncertainty and potential positive effects of AI on employment."
            },
            "Example 2 (CWMP Success)": {
                "Input": "What will be the long-term effects of artificial intelligence on employment?",
                "CWMP Output": "World Model 1 (Techno-optimist, 70% confidence): AI will create more jobs than it displaces by enabling new industries and increasing productivity. Key assumptions: Continuous innovation, adaptable workforce.\n\nWorld Model 2 (Techno-pessimist, 65% confidence): AI will lead to massive unemployment and social upheaval as most jobs become automated. Key assumptions: Rapid AI advancement, slow societal adaptation.\n\nWorld Model 3 (Balanced view, 80% confidence): AI will cause significant job market shifts, with some industries declining while others grow. Overall employment levels may remain stable but require extensive reskilling. Key assumptions: Gradual AI integration, proactive policy measures.\n\nComparison: All models agree that AI will significantly impact employment. They disagree on the net effect (positive, negative, or neutral) and the pace of change.\n\nFinal Synthesis (60% confidence): The long-term effects of AI on employment are likely to be mixed and complex. While some job displacement is probable, new opportunities are also likely to emerge. The exact balance will depend on factors such as the pace of AI development, economic policies, and workforce adaptation. Given the disagreement between perspectives, there is significant uncertainty about the overall impact, necessitating ongoing research and adaptive policies.",
                "Explanation": "CWMP generates multiple perspectives, compares them, and synthesizes a nuanced response that acknowledges uncertainty and the complexity of the issue. The lower confidence (60%) reflects the recognized uncertainty."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CWMP does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Examining the quality and diversity of generated world models to ensure they capture a wide range of perspectives. 2) Analyzing the comparison step to see if it effectively identifies key agreements and disagreements. 3) Investigating whether the synthesis step appropriately incorporates the uncertainty from conflicting views. Based on these analyses, we might refine the prompting strategy, such as by providing more structured prompts for world model generation or by incorporating a quantitative scoring system for inter-model agreement. Additionally, we could explore combining CWMP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it as a more sophisticated ensemble method. If improvements remain elusive, we could pivot to an analysis paper that provides insights into the challenges of prompting for uncertainty quantification and the limitations of current LLMs in handling conflicting information."
