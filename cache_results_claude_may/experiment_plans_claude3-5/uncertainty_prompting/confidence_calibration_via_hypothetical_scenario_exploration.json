        "Problem": "LLMs often display poor calibration when faced with novel or hypothetical scenarios, failing to accurately adjust their confidence in unfamiliar contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing calibration methods typically focus on known distributions or historical data, limiting their effectiveness in novel situations.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring hypothetical scenarios, we can probe the boundaries of an LLM's knowledge and improve its confidence calibration in unfamiliar territories.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Calibration via Hypothetical Scenario Exploration (CCHSE), a prompting strategy that generates and explores counterfactual scenarios to calibrate uncertainty. The method involves: 1) Baseline Assessment: Establish the model's confidence on a set of known queries. 2) Scenario Generation: Use the model to generate hypothetical scenarios that incrementally deviate from known facts, e.g., 'Imagine a world where X is different. How would this affect Y?'. 3) Confidence Probing: For each scenario, prompt the model to answer related queries and express its confidence. 4) Calibration Mapping: Analyze how the model's confidence changes across increasingly divergent scenarios. 5) Adaptive Calibration: Use the observed patterns to develop a calibration function that adjusts confidence estimates based on scenario novelty. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to reason about its own knowledge limitations in unfamiliar contexts.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CCHSE on a range of tasks, including factual QA, scientific reasoning, and ethical decision-making. We'll compare its performance against standard calibration techniques using metrics such as expected calibration error, Brier score, and a novel 'scenario adaptability score'. We'll also conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of scenario complexity and divergence on calibration effectiveness."

        "Title": "Confidence Calibration via Hypothetical Scenario Exploration (CCHSE): Improving LLM Uncertainty Quantification in Novel Contexts",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display poor calibration when faced with novel or hypothetical scenarios, failing to accurately adjust their confidence in unfamiliar contexts. This leads to overconfident predictions in areas where the model's knowledge is limited, potentially resulting in unreliable or misleading outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods typically focus on known distributions or historical data, limiting their effectiveness in novel situations. By systematically exploring hypothetical scenarios, we can probe the boundaries of an LLM's knowledge and improve its confidence calibration in unfamiliar territories. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about counterfactuals, potentially leading to more robust and reliable uncertainty estimates across a wider range of contexts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Calibration via Hypothetical Scenario Exploration (CCHSE), a prompting strategy that generates and explores counterfactual scenarios to calibrate uncertainty. The method involves five key steps: 1) Baseline Assessment: Establish the model's confidence on a set of known queries. 2) Scenario Generation: Use the model to generate hypothetical scenarios that incrementally deviate from known facts. 3) Confidence Probing: For each scenario, prompt the model to answer related queries and express its confidence. 4) Calibration Mapping: Analyze how the model's confidence changes across increasingly divergent scenarios. 5) Adaptive Calibration: Use the observed patterns to develop a calibration function that adjusts confidence estimates based on scenario novelty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, MMLU, and AI2 Reasoning Challenge. Ensure a mix of factual, reasoning, and ethical questions. Create a subset of 'known' questions for baseline assessment and a separate set for generating hypothetical scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Assessment": "Prompt the LLM (e.g., GPT-4) with the known questions and record its answers and confidence scores. Use a prompt like: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'",
            "Step 3: Scenario Generation": "For each question in the hypothetical set, prompt the LLM to generate increasingly divergent scenarios. Use a prompt like: 'Generate 3 hypothetical scenarios related to [QUESTION], each progressively more different from our current reality.'",
            "Step 4: Confidence Probing": "For each generated scenario, prompt the LLM to answer the original question and provide a confidence score. Use a prompt like: 'In the following hypothetical scenario: [SCENARIO], answer this question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'",
            "Step 5: Calibration Mapping": "Analyze the relationship between scenario divergence and confidence scores. Plot confidence scores against scenario divergence for each question type.",
            "Step 6: Adaptive Calibration": "Develop a calibration function that adjusts the model's confidence based on scenario novelty. This could be a simple scaling factor or a more complex function based on the observed patterns.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Test the CCHSE method on a held-out set of questions, comparing its performance against standard calibration techniques. Use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, and a novel 'scenario adaptability score' that measures how well the model's confidence adjusts to novel scenarios.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of scenario complexity and divergence on calibration effectiveness. Vary the number and type of hypothetical scenarios generated to understand their influence on the final calibration.",
            "Step 9: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze the results, focusing on how CCHSE improves calibration across different question types and levels of scenario novelty. Prepare visualizations of confidence adjustments and performance improvements."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
            "CCHSE Prompt Input (Step 1: Scenario Generation)": "Generate 3 hypothetical scenarios related to the question 'What is the capital of France?', each progressively more different from our current reality.",
            "CCHSE Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Scenario Generation)": "1. Scenario: France has moved its capital to Lyon for economic reasons.\n2. Scenario: Due to rising sea levels, France has relocated its capital to a floating city in the Mediterranean.\n3. Scenario: In an alternate timeline, France never became a unified country and consists of several independent duchies.",
            "CCHSE Prompt Input (Step 2: Confidence Probing)": "In the following hypothetical scenario: France has moved its capital to Lyon for economic reasons. Answer this question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: What is the capital of France?",
            "CCHSE Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Confidence Probing)": "A: In this hypothetical scenario, the capital of France is Lyon. Confidence score: 90",
            "Explanation": "The baseline method shows high confidence in a well-known fact. However, CCHSE generates hypothetical scenarios that challenge this knowledge, leading to adjusted confidence scores that better reflect uncertainty in novel contexts. This approach allows the model to express lower confidence in unfamiliar situations, potentially reducing overconfident errors."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCHSE doesn't significantly improve calibration, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why LLMs struggle with confidence calibration in novel scenarios. We could investigate patterns in how confidence changes across different types of hypothetical scenarios, potentially uncovering insights into the model's reasoning process. Additionally, we could explore alternative approaches, such as combining CCHSE with existing calibration techniques or developing a meta-learning approach where the model learns to adjust its confidence based on scenario novelty. Another direction could be to analyze the generated hypothetical scenarios themselves, examining their diversity, plausibility, and impact on model confidence, which could inform future work on improving LLM reasoning in unfamiliar contexts."
