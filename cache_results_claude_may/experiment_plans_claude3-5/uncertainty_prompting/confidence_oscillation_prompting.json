    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where confidence may fluctuate throughout the problem-solving process.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods often provide a single confidence estimate for the final answer.",
        "Motivation": "Human problem-solving often involves moments of varying confidence as we work through different steps. Capturing this dynamic confidence trajectory could provide richer uncertainty information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Oscillation Prompting, which involves breaking down a complex task into multiple steps and prompting the model to provide a confidence estimate after each step. The prompt would include instructions like 'Solve this problem step-by-step. After each step, rate your confidence from 0-100% and explain why.' We then analyze the resulting confidence trajectory, looking at features like the mean, variance, and trend of confidence scores. This method allows us to capture nuanced uncertainty information, such as identifying steps where confidence drops significantly or cases where high final confidence masks low intermediate confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare our method against standard confidence elicitation on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH. Evaluate using metrics like confidence calibration error and a novel 'confidence trajectory similarity' metric comparing model trajectories to human-annotated ones."

        "Title": "Confidence Oscillation Prompting: Capturing Dynamic Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where confidence may fluctuate throughout the problem-solving process. Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods typically provide a single confidence estimate for the final answer, failing to capture the nuanced trajectory of uncertainty as the model reasons through a problem.",
        "Motivation": "Human problem-solving often involves moments of varying confidence as we work through different steps. Capturing this dynamic confidence trajectory could provide richer uncertainty information, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable model outputs. By prompting models to provide step-wise confidence estimates, we can gain insights into which parts of the reasoning process are most uncertain, identify potential failure points, and better understand the model's decision-making process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Oscillation Prompting (COP), which involves breaking down a complex task into multiple steps and prompting the model to provide a confidence estimate after each step. The prompt includes instructions like 'Solve this problem step-by-step. After each step, rate your confidence from 0-100% and explain why.' We then analyze the resulting confidence trajectory, looking at features like the mean, variance, and trend of confidence scores. This method allows us to capture nuanced uncertainty information, such as identifying steps where confidence drops significantly or cases where high final confidence masks low intermediate confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: GSM8K for mathematical reasoning and MATH for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. Both datasets contain multi-step reasoning problems suitable for our analysis.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer (0-100%)?' to each problem. (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with final confidence: Use standard CoT prompting and ask for a final confidence score.",
            "Step 3: COP Implementation": "Implement Confidence Oscillation Prompting: (1) Break down each problem into steps using few-shot examples. (2) After each step, prompt the model to provide a confidence score and explanation. (3) Collect the final answer along with the confidence trajectory.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each dataset and method (baseline and COP), collect model outputs for a subset of 1000 problems. Store the step-by-step reasoning, confidence scores, and final answers.",
            "Step 6: Metrics Calculation": "Calculate the following metrics: (1) Accuracy: Percentage of correct final answers. (2) Calibration Error: Compare confidence scores with actual accuracy. (3) Confidence Trajectory Similarity: Develop a metric to compare model confidence trajectories with human-annotated ones (collect annotations for a small subset of problems). (4) Average Confidence: Calculate mean confidence across all steps. (5) Confidence Variance: Measure the variance in confidence scores across steps.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: (1) Compare accuracy and calibration error between baselines and COP. (2) Analyze confidence trajectories: identify patterns in how confidence changes across reasoning steps. (3) Investigate correlations between confidence trajectory features (e.g., variance, minimum confidence) and final answer correctness. (4) Compare confidence trajectories between correct and incorrect answers. (5) Qualitative analysis of explanations for confidence scores.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: (1) Vary the granularity of confidence scores (e.g., 0-5 scale vs. 0-100%). (2) Remove the explanation requirement for confidence scores. (3) Experiment with different prompting strategies for eliciting step-wise confidence."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? How confident are you in your answer (0-100%)?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.\n\nTotal distance = 120 miles\nTotal time = 2 hours\n\nAverage speed = 120 miles \u00f7 2 hours = 60 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the train's average speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nI'm highly confident in this answer because it's a straightforward calculation using the given information and the well-known formula for average speed.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Confidence Oscillation Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? Solve this problem step-by-step. After each step, rate your confidence from 0-100% and explain why.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Oscillation Prompting)": "Step 1: Identify the given information\n- Distance traveled: 120 miles\n- Time taken: 2 hours\nConfidence: 100%\nExplanation: I'm completely confident in this step because I'm simply restating the information given in the problem.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for average speed\nAverage speed = Total distance \u00f7 Total time\nConfidence: 95%\nExplanation: I'm very confident in this formula, as it's a fundamental equation for calculating average speed. There's a small chance I might be forgetting a detail, hence not 100%.\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values and calculate\nAverage speed = 120 miles \u00f7 2 hours\nConfidence: 98%\nExplanation: I'm highly confident in this step because it's a direct application of the formula with the given values. The small uncertainty is due to the possibility of a minor error in transcribing the numbers.\n\nStep 4: Perform the division\nAverage speed = 60 miles per hour\nConfidence: 99%\nExplanation: I'm very confident in this calculation as it's a simple division. The 1% uncertainty accounts for the tiny chance of a calculation error.\n\nFinal Answer: The train's average speed is 60 miles per hour.\nOverall Confidence: 98%\nExplanation: I'm highly confident in the final answer because each step was performed with high confidence, and the problem involved straightforward application of a well-known formula with simple arithmetic.",
            "Explanation": "The Confidence Oscillation Prompting method provides a more detailed view of the model's confidence throughout the problem-solving process. It allows us to see how confidence might fluctuate between steps and provides explanations for each confidence rating. This granular information can be valuable for understanding where potential uncertainties or errors might occur in the reasoning process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Confidence Oscillation Prompting method doesn't significantly improve calibration or provide meaningful insights compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of the confidence trajectories to identify patterns or characteristics that might be indicative of correct or incorrect reasoning, even if they don't directly improve calibration. This could lead to insights about how models approach problem-solving and where they tend to struggle. Second, we could experiment with using the confidence trajectories as input features for a meta-model that predicts the correctness of the final answer, potentially improving overall system performance. Third, we could investigate whether certain types of problems or reasoning steps consistently lead to lower confidence, which could inform targeted improvements in model training or prompt engineering. Finally, we could expand our study to compare confidence trajectories across different model sizes or architectures, potentially uncovering insights about how model scale or architecture affects uncertainty estimation in reasoning tasks."
