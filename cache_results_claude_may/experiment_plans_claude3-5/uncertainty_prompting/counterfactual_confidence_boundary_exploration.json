        "Problem": "LLMs often have difficulty identifying the boundaries of their knowledge and capabilities, leading to overconfidence in areas where their knowledge is limited or unreliable.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or use external knowledge bases for verification.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring counterfactual scenarios that push the boundaries of the model's knowledge, we can better map the contours of its confidence landscape and identify areas of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Boundary Exploration (CCBE). Given an initial query and confidence estimate, CCBE generates a series of counterfactual prompts that systematically alter key aspects of the original query. These counterfactuals are designed to probe the edges of the model's knowledge, gradually moving from familiar territory to more uncertain ground. For example, if the original query is about a historical event, counterfactuals might involve changing the date, location, or key figures involved. The model is prompted to provide confidence estimates for each counterfactual scenario and explain how and why its confidence changes. CCBE then uses these responses to construct a 'confidence boundary map' for the given topic, identifying regions of high and low certainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCBE on a diverse set of knowledge domains, including factual knowledge, reasoning tasks, and creative prompts. Compare against baseline confidence estimation methods. Develop metrics to assess the quality and informativeness of the generated confidence boundary maps. Conduct human expert evaluation to validate the identified knowledge boundaries and uncertainty regions."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Boundary Exploration: Mapping Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge and capabilities, leading to overconfidence in areas where their knowledge is limited or unreliable. This overconfidence can result in the generation of incorrect or misleading information, potentially undermining the trustworthiness and applicability of these models in critical domains.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for quantifying uncertainty in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence estimation or external knowledge bases for verification. However, these approaches often fail to capture the nuanced contours of a model's knowledge landscape. By systematically exploring counterfactual scenarios that push the boundaries of the model's knowledge, we can better map the confidence landscape and identify areas of uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to probe its knowledge limits, potentially offering a more comprehensive and self-contained method for uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Boundary Exploration (CCBE), a novel prompting method designed to map the confidence landscape of LLMs. CCBE operates through the following steps: 1) Given an initial query and confidence estimate, generate a series of counterfactual prompts that systematically alter key aspects of the original query. 2) For each counterfactual, prompt the model to provide a confidence estimate and explain how and why its confidence changes. 3) Use these responses to construct a 'confidence boundary map' for the given topic, identifying regions of high and low certainty. 4) Analyze the resulting map to gain insights into the model's knowledge boundaries and areas of uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of initial queries across multiple knowledge domains, including factual knowledge (e.g., history, science), reasoning tasks (e.g., logic puzzles, mathematical problems), and creative prompts (e.g., story continuation, poetry generation). Aim for at least 100 queries per domain to ensure statistical significance.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Estimation": "Implement two baseline methods for comparison: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide a confidence score (0-100) along with its answer. 2) Softmax temperature scaling: Use the softmax output probabilities as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: CCBE Implementation": "For each initial query: a) Generate 5-10 counterfactual prompts by systematically altering key elements (e.g., dates, locations, entities involved). b) Prompt the model with each counterfactual, asking for an answer, confidence score, and explanation of confidence changes. c) Construct a confidence boundary map by plotting confidence scores against the 'distance' of each counterfactual from the original query.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Test the method on three LLMs: GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and Claude-v1.3, all accessed via their respective APIs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Develop the following metrics: 1) Confidence Range: The spread of confidence scores across counterfactuals. 2) Boundary Sharpness: How quickly confidence drops off at the edges of knowledge. 3) Explanation Quality: Human evaluation of the coherence and relevance of confidence change explanations. 4) Map Consistency: Consistency of confidence patterns across related queries.",
            "Step 6: Human Expert Validation": "Recruit domain experts to review a subset of the confidence boundary maps. Ask them to assess the accuracy of the identified knowledge boundaries and uncertainty regions.",
            "Step 7: Comparative Analysis": "Compare CCBE results against the baseline methods in terms of: 1) Correlation with human expert judgments. 2) Ability to identify subtle knowledge boundaries. 3) Consistency across different queries within the same domain.",
            "Step 8: Error Analysis": "Analyze cases where CCBE performs poorly or inconsistently. Categorize error types and investigate potential causes (e.g., prompt sensitivity, domain-specific challenges).",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of: 1) Number of counterfactuals generated. 2) Diversity of counterfactual types. 3) Inclusion/exclusion of confidence change explanations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: The first person to step on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCBE; Step 1: Initial Query)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCBE; Step 1: Initial Query)": "A: The first person to step on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCBE; Step 2: Counterfactual Generation)": "Generate 5 counterfactual scenarios related to the question 'Who was the first person to step on the moon?' These scenarios should systematically alter key aspects of the original query to probe the boundaries of the model's knowledge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCBE; Step 2: Counterfactual Generation)": "1. What if the moon landing happened in 1975 instead of 1969? Who might have been the first person to step on the moon then?\n2. If the Soviet Union had beaten the US to the moon, who might have been the first person to step on it?\n3. In an alternate timeline where the Apollo program was cancelled after the Apollo 1 fire, who might have eventually become the first person to step on the moon?\n4. If Neil Armstrong had fallen ill just before the Apollo 11 mission, who would likely have been the first person to step on the moon?\n5. In a scenario where the first moon landing was an international collaboration rather than a US mission, who might have been chosen as the first person to step on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCBE; Step 3: Counterfactual Confidence Estimation)": "Q: If the moon landing happened in 1975 instead of 1969, who might have been the first person to step on the moon? Please provide your answer, a confidence score from 0 to 100, and an explanation of why your confidence changed compared to the original question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCBE; Step 3: Counterfactual Confidence Estimation)": "A: If the moon landing happened in 1975 instead of 1969, the first person to step on the moon might have been John Young or Eugene Cernan, who were active astronauts during that time and had experience from previous Apollo missions. Confidence score: 60\n\nExplanation of confidence change: My confidence has decreased significantly from the original question because this is a counterfactual scenario. While I can make an educated guess based on the astronauts who were active in NASA's program in the mid-1970s, there are many uncertain factors. The delay could have changed NASA's astronaut selection process, training procedures, or even geopolitical factors that might have influenced the mission. Without specific historical information about this alternate timeline, I can only speculate based on the real-world astronaut corps of that era.",
            "explanation": "The CCBE method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's confidence landscape. While the baseline method only provides a single high-confidence answer, CCBE generates multiple counterfactuals that probe the edges of the model's knowledge. This reveals areas where the model's confidence decreases and provides insights into the factors that influence its certainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCBE method does not yield significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand why they fail to effectively probe the model's knowledge boundaries. This could lead to insights about the model's reasoning processes and potential blind spots. 2) Investigate whether certain types of queries or knowledge domains are more amenable to counterfactual exploration than others. This could result in a taxonomy of query types and their suitability for different uncertainty quantification methods. 3) Explore combining CCBE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble approaches or calibration techniques, to create a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches. 4) Shift focus to analyzing the quality and consistency of the model's explanations for confidence changes across counterfactuals. This could provide valuable insights into the model's meta-cognitive abilities and how they relate to its actual performance."
