        "Title": "Divergent World Model Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for alternative interpretations or world models when assessing their confidence, leading to overconfidence in ambiguous scenarios. This results in unreliable uncertainty estimates and poor calibration, which can be problematic in high-stakes decision-making contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-perspective reasoning or limited sampling strategies. These methods often fail to capture the full range of possible interpretations or world models that could be relevant to a given query. By explicitly considering multiple, potentially conflicting world models, we can better capture epistemic uncertainty and improve calibration. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often consider multiple perspectives or scenarios when faced with ambiguous situations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Divergent World Model Prompting (DWMP), a novel prompting method that consists of four main steps:\n1. World Model Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate multiple distinct 'world models' or interpretative frameworks relevant to the query.\n2. Multi-Model Reasoning: For each world model, prompt the LLM to reason about the query and provide a confidence estimate.\n3. Inter-Model Conflict Analysis: Prompt the LLM to analyze conflicts between world models and adjust confidence accordingly.\n4. Uncertainty Synthesis: Finally, prompt the LLM to synthesize a calibrated uncertainty estimate that accounts for both intra- and inter-model uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method:\n1. AmbigQA: A dataset of ambiguous questions with multiple valid answers.\n2. TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to test the truthfulness and uncertainty of language models.\n3. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): We will focus on subsets that involve reasoning about ambiguous or uncertain scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate.\n2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use CoT prompting and ask for a confidence estimate at the end.\n3. Ensemble method: Generate multiple answers using different prompts or temperature settings, then aggregate the results.",
            "Step 3: DWMP Implementation": "Implement the four steps of DWMP:\n1. World Model Generation: Prompt: 'Generate 3 distinct world models or perspectives that could be relevant to answering the following question: [QUESTION]'\n2. Multi-Model Reasoning: For each world model, prompt: 'Based on the following world model: [WORLD MODEL], answer the question: [QUESTION]. Provide your answer and a confidence estimate (0-100%).'\n3. Inter-Model Conflict Analysis: Prompt: 'Analyze the conflicts and agreements between the following world models and their answers: [WORLD MODELS AND ANSWERS]. How should these conflicts affect our overall confidence?'\n4. Uncertainty Synthesis: Prompt: 'Given the multiple world models, their answers, confidence estimates, and the conflict analysis, provide a final answer to the question: [QUESTION]. Include a calibrated uncertainty estimate that accounts for both the individual confidence estimates and the inter-model conflicts.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo to assess the method's effectiveness on a smaller model.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate our method:\n1. Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers across all datasets.\n2. Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted probabilities and observed frequencies.\n3. Brier score: A proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n4. AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve): To evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on its confidence estimates.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "1. For each dataset, run all baseline methods and DWMP.\n2. Collect predictions, confidence estimates, and intermediate outputs (e.g., world models, conflict analyses) for each method.\n3. Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method on each dataset.\n4. Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare DWMP against each baseline.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare the performance of DWMP against baselines across all metrics and datasets.\n2. Analyze the generated world models and conflict analyses to understand how they contribute to improved uncertainty estimates.\n3. Investigate cases where DWMP performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines.\n4. Examine the relationship between inter-model conflicts and final uncertainty estimates.\n5. Assess the computational overhead of DWMP compared to simpler methods."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who wrote the play 'Romeo and Juliet'? Provide your answer and a confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: William Shakespeare wrote the play 'Romeo and Juliet'. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 1: World Model Generation)": "Generate 3 distinct world models or perspectives that could be relevant to answering the following question: Who wrote the play 'Romeo and Juliet'?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 1: World Model Generation)": "1. Traditional Attribution: In this world model, we accept the conventional wisdom and historical consensus about authorship in Elizabethan literature.\n2. Collaborative Authorship Theory: This world model considers the possibility that plays were often the result of collaboration between multiple writers.\n3. Alternative Authorship Theory: This perspective entertains the various theories that challenge the traditional attribution of Shakespeare's works.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 2: Multi-Model Reasoning)": "Based on the Traditional Attribution world model, answer the question: Who wrote the play 'Romeo and Juliet'? Provide your answer and a confidence estimate (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 2: Multi-Model Reasoning)": "Answer: William Shakespeare wrote the play 'Romeo and Juliet'. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 3: Inter-Model Conflict Analysis)": "Analyze the conflicts and agreements between the following world models and their answers: [Include all world models and their answers from Step 2]. How should these conflicts affect our overall confidence?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 3: Inter-Model Conflict Analysis)": "The Traditional Attribution and Collaborative Authorship models both support Shakespeare as the primary author, with high confidence. However, the Alternative Authorship model introduces significant uncertainty. The conflicts between these models should reduce our overall confidence, as they highlight the ongoing debates in Shakespeare scholarship.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Given the multiple world models, their answers, confidence estimates, and the conflict analysis, provide a final answer to the question: Who wrote the play 'Romeo and Juliet'? Include a calibrated uncertainty estimate that accounts for both the individual confidence estimates and the inter-model conflicts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The play 'Romeo and Juliet' is most commonly attributed to William Shakespeare. However, considering alternative theories and the possibility of collaborative authorship, we should express some uncertainty. Calibrated Confidence: 85%",
            "Explanation": "DWMP provides a more nuanced and well-calibrated uncertainty estimate by considering multiple perspectives and explicitly analyzing conflicts between them. The direct prompting approach, in contrast, tends to be overconfident and fails to account for alternative viewpoints or ongoing scholarly debates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DWMP does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the generated world models to understand why they didn't lead to improved uncertainty estimates. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning processes and limitations.\n2. Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from DWMP than others. This could lead to a more targeted application of the method.\n3. Explore variations of DWMP, such as iterative refinement of world models or different prompting strategies for conflict analysis.\n4. Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where DWMP performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the method.\n5. Investigate whether DWMP provides benefits beyond just uncertainty estimation, such as more comprehensive or nuanced answers to complex questions.\n6. Combine DWMP with other uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., bootstrapping, temperature scaling) to see if a hybrid approach yields better results.\nBy pursuing these alternative directions, we can still gain valuable insights into LLM reasoning and uncertainty, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
