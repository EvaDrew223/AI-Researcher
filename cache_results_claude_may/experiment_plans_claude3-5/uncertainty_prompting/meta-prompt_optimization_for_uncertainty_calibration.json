    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Existing prompting methods for uncertainty quantification often rely on hand-crafted prompts, which may not generalize well across different tasks and domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use fixed prompting templates or fine-tuning on specific calibration datasets.",
        "Motivation": "Automatically optimizing prompts for uncertainty calibration could lead to more adaptive and generalizable methods for confidence estimation across diverse tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Prompt Optimization for Calibration (MPO-C), a framework that uses a meta-learning approach to generate task-specific calibration prompts. The method involves: 1) A prompt generator model that produces calibration prompts, 2) A calibration evaluation module that assesses the effectiveness of generated prompts, 3) A meta-learning loop that optimizes the prompt generator based on calibration performance across a diverse set of tasks. The optimized prompt generator can then produce effective calibration prompts for new, unseen tasks.",

        "Title": "Meta-Prompt Optimization for Calibration: Adaptive Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing prompting methods for uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) often rely on hand-crafted prompts, which may not generalize well across different tasks and domains. This limits the ability to accurately estimate model confidence and uncertainty across diverse applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically use fixed prompting templates or fine-tuning on specific calibration datasets, which can be inflexible and fail to adapt to new tasks. Automatically optimizing prompts for uncertainty calibration could lead to more adaptive and generalizable methods for confidence estimation across diverse tasks. By leveraging meta-learning techniques, we can potentially learn to generate task-specific calibration prompts that improve uncertainty quantification across a wide range of applications without requiring manual prompt engineering for each new task.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Prompt Optimization for Calibration (MPO-C), a framework that uses a meta-learning approach to generate task-specific calibration prompts. The method involves three key components: 1) A prompt generator model that produces calibration prompts, 2) A calibration evaluation module that assesses the effectiveness of generated prompts, and 3) A meta-learning loop that optimizes the prompt generator based on calibration performance across a diverse set of tasks. The optimized prompt generator can then produce effective calibration prompts for new, unseen tasks.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Collect a diverse set of tasks for training and evaluation. Use datasets from different domains such as question-answering (e.g., SQuAD, NaturalQuestions), sentiment analysis (e.g., SST-2, IMDb), and natural language inference (e.g., MNLI, SNLI). Split these into meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-test sets.",
            "Step 2: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement standard prompting methods as baselines: (a) Direct prompting without calibration, (b) Fixed template calibration prompts (e.g., 'How confident are you about this answer on a scale of 0-100?'), (c) Few-shot calibration prompting with hand-crafted examples.",
            "Step 3: Implement MPO-C Framework": "Develop the three main components of MPO-C: (a) Prompt Generator: Use a small language model (e.g., T5-base) to generate calibration prompts, (b) Calibration Evaluator: Implement metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score to assess calibration quality, (c) Meta-learning Optimizer: Use MAML or Reptile algorithm to update the prompt generator based on calibration performance.",
            "Step 4: Meta-Training": "Train the MPO-C framework on the meta-training set: (a) Sample a batch of tasks, (b) Generate calibration prompts for each task, (c) Evaluate calibration performance, (d) Update prompt generator using meta-learning algorithm, (e) Repeat for multiple epochs, validating on meta-validation set.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation on Held-out Tasks": "Evaluate the trained MPO-C framework on the meta-test set: (a) Generate calibration prompts for new tasks, (b) Apply these prompts to a target LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4), (c) Measure calibration performance and compare against baselines.",
            "Step 6: Analysis and Ablation Studies": "Conduct additional experiments to understand the method: (a) Analyze generated prompts qualitatively, (b) Vary the size and diversity of the meta-training set, (c) Test transferability across different target LLMs, (d) Ablate different components of the MPO-C framework."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. [Generated Calibration Prompt]: Based on your knowledge and the information provided, how certain are you about this answer? Please express your confidence as a percentage between 0% and 100%, where 0% means completely uncertain and 100% means absolutely certain. Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "I am 99% certain that the capital of France is Paris. This is a well-known fact that I have encountered numerous times in various reliable sources. Paris has been the capital of France for centuries and is widely recognized as such in geography, politics, and culture. The only reason I'm not saying 100% is that there's always a tiny possibility of a very recent, unprecedented change that I might not be aware of, but this is extremely unlikely.",
            "Explanation": "The MPO-C generated prompt elicits a more nuanced expression of confidence, encouraging the model to consider its certainty level and provide reasoning. This allows for better calibration compared to the baseline, which simply states the answer without any indication of confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MPO-C method doesn't significantly improve calibration performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated calibration prompts to understand why they might be ineffective, potentially uncovering insights about prompt design for uncertainty quantification. Second, we could explore combining MPO-C with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to create a hybrid approach. Third, we might investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of tasks or domains, focusing on where it shows the most promise. Finally, we could shift towards an analysis paper, comparing different prompting strategies for uncertainty quantification across various tasks and models, providing a comprehensive study of the strengths and limitations of prompt-based calibration methods in LLMs."
