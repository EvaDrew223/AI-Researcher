        "Problem": "Static prompting methods for confidence calibration often fail to adapt to the diverse range of queries and contexts encountered by LLMs, leading to inconsistent calibration across different scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing calibration methods use fixed prompts or post-processing techniques that don't adapt to the specific context of each query.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically evolving prompts based on the model's responses and confidence levels, we can create a more adaptive and accurate calibration process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Dynamic Prompt Evolution for Confidence Calibration (DPECC), an iterative prompting technique that: (1) Starts with a base calibration prompt. (2) Analyzes the model's response and confidence estimate. (3) Generates targeted follow-up prompts to probe areas of potential miscalibration. (4) Iteratively refines the confidence estimate based on these probes. (5) Evolves the prompt structure and content over time to improve calibration across diverse queries. This approach allows for continual adaptation and improvement of the calibration process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DPECC on a wide range of tasks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain queries. We'll compare it against static calibration methods, focusing on metrics like Expected Calibration Error and adaptability to novel scenarios. We'll also analyze the evolution of prompts over time to gain insights into the calibration process and the types of queries that require more sophisticated calibration strategies."

        "Title": "Dynamic Prompt Evolution for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Static prompting methods for confidence calibration often fail to adapt to the diverse range of queries and contexts encountered by LLMs, leading to inconsistent calibration across different scenarios. This inconsistency can result in unreliable confidence estimates, potentially leading to incorrect decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods typically rely on fixed prompts or post-processing techniques that don't adapt to the specific context of each query. By dynamically evolving prompts based on the model's responses and confidence levels, we can create a more adaptive and accurate calibration process. This approach allows for continual adaptation and improvement of the calibration process, potentially leading to more reliable confidence estimates across a wide range of tasks and domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Dynamic Prompt Evolution for Confidence Calibration (DPECC), an iterative prompting technique that consists of the following steps: (1) Start with a base calibration prompt. (2) Analyze the model's response and confidence estimate. (3) Generate targeted follow-up prompts to probe areas of potential miscalibration. (4) Iteratively refine the confidence estimate based on these probes. (5) Evolve the prompt structure and content over time to improve calibration across diverse queries. This approach allows for continual adaptation and improvement of the calibration process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare a diverse set of tasks including both in-domain and out-of-domain queries. Use datasets such as TruthfulQA for factual question answering, MMLU for multi-task evaluation, and ARC for scientific reasoning. Split each dataset into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement static calibration methods as baselines: (a) Temperature scaling, (b) Platt scaling, (c) Static prompt-based calibration (e.g., 'How confident are you about this answer on a scale of 0-100?'). Evaluate these baselines on the validation sets of all datasets.",
            "Step 3: DPECC Implementation": "Implement the DPECC method with the following sub-steps: (a) Design a base calibration prompt template. (b) Implement a module to analyze model responses and confidence estimates. (c) Develop a prompt generation module that creates targeted follow-up prompts. (d) Implement an iterative refinement process for confidence estimates. (e) Create a prompt evolution mechanism that adapts prompt structure and content over time.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM from Google.",
            "Step 5: Training Phase": "Using the training sets, run DPECC for multiple iterations to allow the prompt evolution mechanism to learn effective prompt structures and content. Monitor the calibration improvement on the validation sets to determine when to stop the evolution process.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate DPECC and baselines on the test sets of all datasets. Use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. Also measure the adaptability to novel scenarios by testing on out-of-distribution examples.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results: (a) Compare DPECC performance against baselines across different tasks and domains. (b) Analyze the evolution of prompts over time to gain insights into the calibration process. (c) Identify types of queries that require more sophisticated calibration strategies. (d) Examine the impact of different LLMs on the effectiveness of DPECC.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of DPECC: (a) Remove the prompt evolution mechanism. (b) Use only a single iteration of refinement. (c) Vary the number of follow-up prompts generated.",
            "Step 9: Robustness Testing": "Test the robustness of DPECC by: (a) Introducing adversarial examples designed to confuse calibration. (b) Evaluating performance on multilingual tasks. (c) Testing on tasks with varying levels of difficulty.",
            "Step 10: Efficiency Analysis": "Measure the computational overhead of DPECC compared to static methods. Analyze the trade-off between improved calibration and increased computation time."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you about this answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DPECC; Step 1: Initial Query)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DPECC; Step 1: Initial Query)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DPECC; Step 2: Confidence Estimation)": "Based on your previous answer that Paris is the capital of France, how confident are you about this on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DPECC; Step 2: Confidence Estimation)": "Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DPECC; Step 3: Follow-up Probe)": "Can you think of any potential reasons why Paris might not be the capital of France? List any historical or political factors that could challenge this claim.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DPECC; Step 3: Follow-up Probe)": "While Paris is indeed the capital of France, and there are no serious challenges to this fact, here are some hypothetical scenarios that could be considered:\n1. Historical changes: In the past, other cities like Versailles have briefly served as the seat of government.\n2. Decentralization: Some countries have multiple capitals for different branches of government, though this is not the case for France.\n3. Future changes: While highly unlikely, there could theoretically be a future political decision to move the capital.\nHowever, none of these scenarios actually apply to the current situation. Paris remains the undisputed capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DPECC; Step 4: Refined Confidence)": "Given your initial answer and the follow-up considerations, please provide a refined confidence estimate (0-100) for the statement 'Paris is the capital of France'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DPECC; Step 4: Refined Confidence)": "Refined Confidence: 99\nExplanation: While I remain extremely confident that Paris is the capital of France, the consideration of hypothetical scenarios and historical changes reminds me that even well-established facts can have nuances or potential for change, however unlikely. This slight reduction in confidence from 100 to 99 reflects a more calibrated and thoughtful approach to certainty.",
            "Explanation": "The DPECC method demonstrates a more nuanced approach to confidence calibration. While the baseline method might lead to overconfident estimates, DPECC encourages the model to consider potential challenges to its initial answer, leading to a slightly more conservative but better-calibrated confidence estimate. This process allows for adaptation to different types of questions and promotes more thoughtful confidence assessments."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DPECC does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the types of questions where DPECC fails to improve calibration. This could lead to insights about the limitations of prompt-based calibration methods and inform future research directions. 2) Investigate whether the follow-up probes generated by DPECC provide valuable information even if they don't improve calibration. This could turn the project into an analysis of LLM self-reflection capabilities. 3) Explore combining DPECC with other calibration methods, such as ensemble techniques or meta-learning approaches, to create a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches. 4) Shift focus to analyzing how different LLMs respond to dynamic prompting for calibration, potentially uncovering interesting differences in their underlying architectures or training procedures."
