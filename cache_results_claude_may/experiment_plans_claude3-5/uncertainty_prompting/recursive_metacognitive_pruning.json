        "Problem": "LLMs often provide lengthy, unfocused responses with uniform confidence, failing to distinguish between core claims and peripheral details in terms of certainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically assign a single confidence score to an entire response, missing the nuanced confidence levels that may exist for different parts of the answer.",
        "Motivation": "Humans naturally focus on key points they're most confident about when explaining complex topics. We aim to emulate this metacognitive process in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Metacognitive Pruning (RMP), a technique that iteratively refines and focuses model responses while quantifying confidence at each step. The process involves: 1) Generating an initial response to a query. 2) Prompting the model to identify the most crucial claim in its response and assign a confidence score to it. 3) Asking the model to generate supporting details for this claim, each with its own confidence score. 4) Recursively applying steps 2-3 to each supporting detail, creating a tree structure of claims and confidences. 5) Pruning low-confidence branches and collapsing the tree into a focused response with hierarchical confidence scores.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RMP with baseline methods on tasks requiring detailed explanations, such as scientific reasoning or complex decision-making scenarios. Evaluate the method's ability to produce more focused responses and provide granular confidence estimates. Assess user preference and comprehension of RMP outputs compared to standard LLM responses."

        "Title": "Recursive Metacognitive Pruning: Enhancing Confidence Calibration and Response Focus in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate lengthy, unfocused responses with uniform confidence levels, failing to distinguish between core claims and peripheral details in terms of certainty. This lack of nuanced confidence calibration and focused output hinders the interpretability and reliability of LLM-generated content.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically assign a single confidence score to an entire response, missing the nuanced confidence levels that may exist for different parts of the answer. Humans naturally focus on key points they're most confident about when explaining complex topics, employing metacognitive processes to refine and prioritize information. By emulating this process in LLMs, we aim to produce more focused, confidence-calibrated responses that better reflect the model's true knowledge and uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Metacognitive Pruning (RMP), a technique that iteratively refines and focuses model responses while quantifying confidence at each step. The process involves: 1) Generating an initial response to a query. 2) Prompting the model to identify the most crucial claim in its response and assign a confidence score to it. 3) Asking the model to generate supporting details for this claim, each with its own confidence score. 4) Recursively applying steps 2-3 to each supporting detail, creating a tree structure of claims and confidences. 5) Pruning low-confidence branches and collapsing the tree into a focused response with hierarchical confidence scores.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of domains and complexity levels, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of RMP across different types of tasks.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible for research purposes.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Methods Implementation": "We will implement three baseline methods for comparison: 1) Standard prompting: directly asking the model to answer the question. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: asking the model to think step-by-step before providing the final answer. 3) Self-consistency: generating multiple CoT responses and taking the majority vote.",
            "Step 4: RMP Implementation": "We will implement the Recursive Metacognitive Pruning method as follows: a) Initial response generation: 'Please provide an answer to the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Main claim identification: 'From your previous response, what is the most crucial claim? Assign a confidence score from 0 to 100 to this claim.' c) Supporting details generation: 'Provide supporting details for the main claim you identified. Assign a confidence score from 0 to 100 to each supporting detail.' d) Recursive application: Apply steps b and c to each supporting detail until a maximum depth is reached or no further details are provided. e) Pruning and collapsing: Remove branches with confidence scores below a threshold (e.g., 50) and collapse the remaining tree into a structured response.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate our method: 1) Accuracy: percentage of correct answers. 2) Confidence calibration: measure the correlation between confidence scores and correctness. 3) Response length: compare the length of responses between baseline methods and RMP. 4) Human evaluation: assess the focus and coherence of responses on a subset of examples.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Generate responses using each baseline method and RMP. b) Calculate accuracy, confidence calibration, and response length metrics. c) Conduct human evaluation on a subset of 100 randomly selected examples from each dataset.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of RMP against baseline methods across all metrics. Analyze the trade-offs between accuracy, confidence calibration, and response focus. Investigate how the performance varies across different types of questions and reasoning tasks."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France, and when was the Eiffel Tower built?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RMP Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France, and when was the Eiffel Tower built? Please provide an answer to this question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RMP Step 1: Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889. Paris has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages and is known for its rich history, culture, and iconic landmarks. The Eiffel Tower, designed by Gustave Eiffel, was constructed for the 1889 World's Fair, which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. It took two years to complete and was initially met with some criticism but has since become one of the most recognizable structures in the world.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RMP Step 2: Main Claim Identification)": "From your previous response, what is the most crucial claim? Assign a confidence score from 0 to 100 to this claim.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RMP Step 2: Main Claim Identification)": "Most crucial claim: The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889.\nConfidence score: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RMP Step 3: Supporting Details Generation)": "Provide supporting details for the main claim you identified. Assign a confidence score from 0 to 100 to each supporting detail.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RMP Step 3: Supporting Details Generation)": "1. Paris has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages. (Confidence score: 95)\n2. The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel. (Confidence score: 97)\n3. The Eiffel Tower was constructed for the 1889 World's Fair. (Confidence score: 96)\n4. The 1889 World's Fair celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. (Confidence score: 93)\n5. The Eiffel Tower took two years to complete. (Confidence score: 90)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RMP Final Step: Pruned and Collapsed Response)": "Based on the main claim and supporting details, provide a focused response with hierarchical confidence scores.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RMP Final Step: Pruned and Collapsed Response)": "The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889. (98% confidence)\n- Paris has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages. (95% confidence)\n- The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel and constructed for the 1889 World's Fair. (96% confidence)\n  - The World's Fair celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. (93% confidence)",
            "explanation": "The RMP method produces a more focused and confidence-calibrated response compared to standard prompting. It identifies the most crucial information, provides supporting details with individual confidence scores, and presents a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and certainty of each claim."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RMP method does not significantly improve over baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the intermediate steps of the RMP process, such as the quality of main claim identification and supporting detail generation. We could also investigate whether certain types of questions or reasoning tasks benefit more from RMP than others. Additionally, we might explore variations of the RMP method, such as adjusting the confidence thresholds for pruning or modifying the recursive depth. If these analyses yield interesting insights, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth study of how LLMs perform metacognitive tasks, comparing their behavior to human metacognition and identifying areas for improvement in future LLM designs."
