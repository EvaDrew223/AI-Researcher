        "Title": "Confidence Fractal Prompting: Recursive Task Decomposition for Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates for their outputs, especially for complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks requiring intricate problem-solving steps, where the model's overall confidence may not reflect the varying levels of certainty across different sub-components of the reasoning process.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like self-consistency sampling and calibrated few-shot learning provide coarse-grained confidence estimates that fail to capture the nuanced uncertainty inherent in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by fractal theory in mathematics, we hypothesize that confidence can be more accurately quantified by recursively decomposing a task into subtasks and aggregating fine-grained confidence estimates. This approach allows for a more detailed and interpretable representation of the model's uncertainty, potentially leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Fractal Prompting (CFP), which involves four main steps: 1) Task decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the main task into a tree of subtasks. 2) Leaf node confidence estimation: For each leaf subtask, prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score and justification. 3) Recursive aggregation: Starting from the leaf nodes, prompt the LLM to aggregate child node confidences into parent node confidences, considering interdependencies. 4) Fractal visualization: Generate a fractal-like visualization of the confidence tree to aid human interpretation. This method allows for fine-grained uncertainty quantification and provides interpretable confidence estimates at multiple levels of abstraction.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for evaluation: 1) GSM8K: A dataset of 8,500 grade school math word problems. 2) MATH: A dataset of 12,500 middle and high school mathematics problems. Split each dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to solve the problem and provide a confidence score. 2) Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: Use the standard CoT prompt and ask for a final confidence score. 3) Self-consistency: Generate multiple CoT samples and use the agreement rate as the confidence score.",
            "Step 3: Confidence Fractal Prompting Implementation": "Implement the four steps of CFP: 1) Task decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the problem into a tree of subtasks. Use few-shot examples to demonstrate the desired format. 2) Leaf node confidence estimation: For each leaf subtask, prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification. 3) Recursive aggregation: Starting from the leaf nodes, prompt the LLM to aggregate child node confidences into parent node confidences. Provide guidelines for considering interdependencies. 4) Fractal visualization: Implement a function to generate a tree-like visualization of the confidence structure.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test GPT-3.5-turbo to assess the method's performance on a smaller model.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Accuracy: Percentage of correctly solved problems. 2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure of calibration quality. 3) Brier Score: Measure of the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 4) Spearman's Rank Correlation: Between confidence scores and correctness.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the test sets: 1) Run all baseline methods and record their outputs and confidence scores. 2) Run the CFP method and record the decomposed subtasks, leaf node confidences, aggregated confidences, and final answer. 3) Generate the fractal visualization for each CFP result.",
            "Step 7: Results Analysis": "1) Compare the accuracy and confidence calibration of CFP against the baselines using the defined metrics. 2) Analyze the structure of the generated task decompositions and confidence trees. 3) Investigate cases where CFP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. 4) Examine the relationship between leaf node confidences and overall task confidence.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "1) Vary the depth of task decomposition to assess its impact on performance. 2) Compare different aggregation strategies for combining leaf node confidences. 3) Evaluate the impact of including or excluding justifications for confidence estimates.",
            "Step 9: Visualization and Interpretation": "1) Create sample visualizations of confidence fractals for both correctly and incorrectly solved problems. 2) Analyze patterns in the fractal structures that correlate with high or low overall confidence and accuracy. 3) Develop guidelines for interpreting the confidence fractals to gain insights into the model's reasoning process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: James has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more apples from the store. How many apples does James have now? Please solve this problem and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Let's solve this step by step:\n1. James starts with 5 apples.\n2. He gives 2 apples to his friend, so now he has 5 - 2 = 3 apples.\n3. He then buys 3 more apples from the store.\n4. So now he has 3 + 3 = 6 apples.\n\nTherefore, James has 6 apples now.\n\nConfidence score: 95\n\nI'm highly confident in this answer because the problem involves simple addition and subtraction with small numbers, which is straightforward to calculate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CFP Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Q: James has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to his friend and then buys 3 more apples from the store. How many apples does James have now?\n\nPlease break down this problem into a tree of subtasks. Each subtask should be a specific calculation or operation. Use the format:\n\nMain Task: [Description]\n  Subtask 1: [Description]\n    Subtask 1.1: [Description]\n    Subtask 1.2: [Description]\n  Subtask 2: [Description]\n    Subtask 2.1: [Description]\n  Subtask 3: [Description]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CFP Step 1: Task Decomposition)": "Main Task: Calculate the final number of apples James has\n  Subtask 1: Calculate apples after giving to friend\n    Subtask 1.1: Identify initial number of apples\n    Subtask 1.2: Subtract apples given to friend\n  Subtask 2: Add newly bought apples\n    Subtask 2.1: Identify number of apples bought\n  Subtask 3: Sum remaining and new apples",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CFP Step 2: Leaf Node Confidence Estimation)": "For each leaf subtask, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 and a brief justification. Use the format:\n\nSubtask: [Description]\nConfidence: [Score]\nJustification: [Brief explanation]\n\nLeaf subtasks:\n1. Identify initial number of apples\n2. Subtract apples given to friend\n3. Identify number of apples bought\n4. Sum remaining and new apples",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CFP Step 2: Leaf Node Confidence Estimation)": "Subtask: Identify initial number of apples\nConfidence: 100\nJustification: The problem clearly states James has 5 apples initially.\n\nSubtask: Subtract apples given to friend\nConfidence: 98\nJustification: Simple subtraction of 2 from 5, very straightforward.\n\nSubtask: Identify number of apples bought\nConfidence: 100\nJustification: The problem explicitly states James buys 3 more apples.\n\nSubtask: Sum remaining and new apples\nConfidence: 97\nJustification: Addition of two small numbers, but slight chance of mental arithmetic error.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CFP Step 3: Recursive Aggregation)": "Given the confidence scores for the leaf subtasks, aggregate them into confidence scores for the parent tasks. Consider the interdependencies between subtasks and how errors might propagate. Use the format:\n\nTask: [Description]\nConfidence: [Score]\nJustification: [Brief explanation]\n\nTask tree with leaf confidences:\nMain Task: Calculate the final number of apples James has\n  Subtask 1: Calculate apples after giving to friend\n    Subtask 1.1: Identify initial number of apples (100)\n    Subtask 1.2: Subtract apples given to friend (98)\n  Subtask 2: Add newly bought apples\n    Subtask 2.1: Identify number of apples bought (100)\n  Subtask 3: Sum remaining and new apples (97)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CFP Step 3: Recursive Aggregation)": "Task: Calculate apples after giving to friend\nConfidence: 98\nJustification: High confidence in both subtasks, but slight uncertainty in subtraction carries through.\n\nTask: Add newly bought apples\nConfidence: 100\nJustification: Direct information from the problem, no calculation needed.\n\nTask: Calculate the final number of apples James has\nConfidence: 95\nJustification: High confidence in subtasks, but small chance of error in final addition slightly reduces overall confidence.",
            "explanation": "The Confidence Fractal Prompting method provides a more detailed and nuanced confidence assessment compared to the baseline. It breaks down the problem into subtasks, assigns confidence scores to each leaf node, and then aggregates these scores, considering potential error propagation. This approach offers insights into which parts of the problem-solving process might be more prone to errors, allowing for a more accurate overall confidence estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Confidence Fractal Prompting method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated task decompositions and confidence trees to understand why the method isn't performing as expected. This could involve examining patterns in decomposition strategies, identifying common failure modes, or investigating how different problem types lead to different fractal structures. Second, we could explore alternative aggregation methods for combining leaf node confidences, such as weighted averages based on task importance or machine learning models trained on the structure of the confidence trees. Third, we could investigate how the fractal confidence structures correlate with actual error patterns in the model's reasoning, potentially leading to insights about the model's internal decision-making process. Finally, we could expand the scope of the project to include human evaluation of the generated confidence fractals, assessing whether they provide more actionable information for end-users compared to simple confidence scores, even if they don't directly improve quantitative metrics."
