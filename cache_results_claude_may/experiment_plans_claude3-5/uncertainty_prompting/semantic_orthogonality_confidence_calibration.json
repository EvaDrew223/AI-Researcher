        "Problem": "LLMs often overlook semantic nuances and contextual shifts that can significantly impact the certainty of their responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically don't explicitly account for semantic drift or contextual shifts in meaning.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring semantically orthogonal interpretations of a query, we can uncover hidden uncertainties and achieve better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Orthogonality Confidence Calibration: 1) Given a query, prompt the model to generate multiple semantically distinct interpretations by exploring different contexts, domains, or linguistic framings. 2) For each interpretation, prompt the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 3) Prompt the model to analyze the semantic distance between interpretations and identify key points of divergence. 4) Apply a novel 'semantic orthogonality' algorithm that adjusts the overall confidence based on the degree of divergence between interpretations and the model's ability to reconcile them.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on ambiguous queries from datasets like AmbigQA and compare against standard prompting and existing calibration techniques. Evaluate not just overall calibration, but also the method's ability to identify and quantify genuine semantic ambiguities."

        "Title": "Semantic Orthogonality Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often overlook semantic nuances and contextual shifts that can significantly impact the certainty of their responses, leading to overconfident or miscalibrated predictions. This problem is particularly acute in scenarios where queries have multiple valid interpretations or require domain-specific knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods typically don't explicitly account for semantic drift or contextual shifts in meaning. By exploring semantically orthogonal interpretations of a query, we can uncover hidden uncertainties and achieve better-calibrated confidence estimates. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to generate diverse interpretations and analyze semantic relationships, potentially leading to more robust and reliable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Orthogonality Confidence Calibration (SOCC), a multi-step process that leverages the LLM's ability to generate and analyze diverse interpretations of a query. The steps are: 1) Given a query, prompt the model to generate multiple semantically distinct interpretations by exploring different contexts, domains, or linguistic framings. 2) For each interpretation, prompt the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 3) Prompt the model to analyze the semantic distance between interpretations and identify key points of divergence. 4) Apply a novel 'semantic orthogonality' algorithm that adjusts the overall confidence based on the degree of divergence between interpretations and the model's ability to reconcile them.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use the AmbigQA dataset, which contains ambiguous questions with multiple valid interpretations. Additionally, create a subset of the Natural Questions dataset by selecting questions that have potential for multiple interpretations or domain-specific nuances.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and existing calibration techniques such as temperature scaling and ensemble methods as baselines.",
            "Step 3: SOCC Implementation": "Implement the SOCC method with the following sub-steps: a) Interpretation Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 3-5 semantically distinct interpretations of each query. b) Answer and Confidence Generation: For each interpretation, prompt the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100). c) Semantic Analysis: Prompt the LLM to analyze the semantic distance between interpretations and identify key divergence points. d) Confidence Calibration: Implement the semantic orthogonality algorithm to adjust the final confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. Additionally, assess the method's ability to identify genuine semantic ambiguities using human evaluation on a subset of examples.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct an in-depth analysis of the results, focusing on: a) Comparison of SOCC with baseline methods. b) Impact of the number of generated interpretations on calibration performance. c) Correlation between semantic divergence and calibration improvement. d) Qualitative analysis of cases where SOCC significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Roald Amundsen was the first person to reach the South Pole on December 14, 1911. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Interpretation Generation)": "Generate 3 semantically distinct interpretations of the question: 'Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Interpretation Generation)": "1. Who was the first person to physically set foot at the geographic South Pole?\n2. Who was the first person to reach the South Pole region, including nearby areas?\n3. Who was the first person to reach the South Pole and return alive to tell about it?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Answer and Confidence Generation)": "For each interpretation, provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100):",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Answer and Confidence Generation)": "1. Roald Amundsen, on December 14, 1911. Confidence: 95%\n2. James Clark Ross, who discovered the Ross Ice Shelf in 1841, which is considered part of the Antarctic continent. Confidence: 80%\n3. Roald Amundsen, who reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911, and returned safely. Confidence: 90%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Semantic Analysis)": "Analyze the semantic distance between these interpretations and identify key points of divergence:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Semantic Analysis)": "The interpretations differ in their definition of 'reaching' the South Pole. Interpretation 1 focuses on the exact geographic point, while interpretation 2 considers a broader region. Interpretation 3 adds the condition of returning alive. The key divergence is between the strict geographic definition and the broader historical context of Antarctic exploration.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Confidence Calibration)": "Based on the semantic analysis and the confidence scores for each interpretation, provide a calibrated overall confidence score and explanation:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Confidence Calibration)": "Calibrated Confidence: 85%. Explanation: While there's high confidence in Amundsen being the first to reach the exact South Pole point, the semantic analysis reveals ambiguity in what 'reaching' the South Pole means in a broader historical context. This ambiguity, combined with the lower confidence in earlier explorations of the Antarctic region, justifies a reduction in overall confidence from the initial 95% to 85%.",
            "Explanation": "The SOCC method reveals semantic nuances in the question that the baseline approach overlooks. By considering multiple interpretations and their semantic relationships, it provides a more nuanced and likely better-calibrated confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SOCC method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated interpretations to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of interpretations generated and their relationship to calibration performance. 2) Investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when semantic ambiguity is most relevant to confidence calibration. 3) Explore modifications to the semantic orthogonality algorithm, such as incorporating external knowledge bases to validate the generated interpretations. 4) Analyze cases where SOCC performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the approach, which could inform the development of a hybrid method combining strengths of SOCC and traditional calibration techniques."
