    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their confidence levels, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically involve direct prompting for confidence scores or using ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of numerical optimization, we can guide the model to refine its confidence estimate iteratively, similar to how gradient descent algorithms converge on optimal solutions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient Confidence Prompting (GCP), a novel iterative prompting technique. GCP starts with an initial confidence estimate and systematically probes the model with slight variations of the original query. The model is prompted to adjust its confidence based on these variations, effectively exploring the 'confidence landscape'. The prompts are designed to mimic gradient computations, asking the model to consider how small changes in the query affect its certainty. For example: 'Given your initial 70% confidence, how would your certainty change if the query was slightly modified to X? Increase, decrease, or stay the same?' This process is repeated, gradually refining the confidence estimate until convergence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare GCP against standard confidence elicitation techniques on a range of tasks, including factual QA, reasoning problems, and ambiguous queries. Evaluate using calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score. Also measure the correlation between model confidence and human-judged answer quality."

        "Title": "Gradient Confidence Prompting: Iterative Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their confidence levels, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries where uncertainty quantification is crucial. This issue can lead to overconfident responses in situations where the model should express uncertainty, potentially misleading users and reducing the reliability of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically involve direct prompting for confidence scores or using ensemble methods. However, these methods often fail to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty in complex queries. Inspired by numerical optimization techniques, we propose a novel method that guides the model to refine its confidence estimate iteratively, similar to how gradient descent algorithms converge on optimal solutions. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to explore the 'confidence landscape' and arrive at a more accurate uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient Confidence Prompting (GCP), a novel iterative prompting technique. GCP starts with an initial confidence estimate and systematically probes the model with slight variations of the original query. The process involves the following steps:\n1. Initial Confidence Estimation: Prompt the model for an initial confidence score.\n2. Query Variation Generation: Create slight variations of the original query.\n3. Confidence Gradient Computation: Prompt the model to assess how each variation affects its confidence.\n4. Confidence Update: Adjust the confidence estimate based on the 'gradient' information.\n5. Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or a set number of iterations.\nThe prompts are designed to mimic gradient computations, asking the model to consider how small changes in the query affect its certainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method:\n1. TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to test the truthfulness and uncertainty of language models.\n2. AmbigQA: A dataset containing ambiguous questions to test model uncertainty in unclear scenarios.\n3. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A subset focusing on science and math questions to test confidence in specialized knowledge domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\n1. Direct Confidence Prompting: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer.\n2. Ensemble Method: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to estimate uncertainty based on answer variance.",
            "Step 3: GCP Implementation": "Implement the Gradient Confidence Prompting method:\n1. Initial Prompt: 'Given the question \"{question}\", please provide an answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100%.'\n2. Variation Generation: Create 3-5 slight variations of the original question by adding or removing details, changing wording, etc.\n3. Gradient Prompt: 'Given your initial {confidence}% confidence for the question \"{original_question}\", how would your certainty change if the question was slightly modified to \"{varied_question}\"? Increase, decrease, or stay the same? By how many percentage points?'\n4. Update Prompt: 'Based on the changes in confidence for the variations, what should be the updated overall confidence for the original question \"{original_question}\"?'\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 3-5 iterations or until convergence.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models provide state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance:\n1. Calibration Error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy.\n2. Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Compute the expected difference between confidence and accuracy.\n3. Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n4. Correlation: Calculate the correlation between model confidence and human-judged answer quality (for a subset of questions).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\n1. Run the baseline methods and collect results.\n2. Run the GCP method and collect results.\n3. Compute all evaluation metrics for both baselines and GCP.\n4. Repeat each experiment 5 times to account for variability in model outputs.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare GCP performance against baselines across all metrics.\n2. Analyze how GCP performance changes with the number of iterations.\n3. Investigate the types of questions where GCP shows the most improvement.\n4. Examine the generated question variations and their impact on confidence updates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GCP; Initial Step)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GCP; Initial Step)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GCP; Gradient Step)": "Given your initial 100% confidence for the question \"What is the capital of France?\", how would your certainty change if the question was slightly modified to \"What was the capital of France in 1789?\"? Increase, decrease, or stay the same? By how many percentage points?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GCP; Gradient Step)": "Decrease. The confidence would decrease by approximately 10 percentage points. While Paris was indeed the capital of France in 1789, there might be some uncertainty due to the historical context and potential changes during the French Revolution.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GCP; Update Step)": "Based on the changes in confidence for the variations, what should be the updated overall confidence for the original question \"What is the capital of France?\"?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GCP; Update Step)": "The updated overall confidence for the original question \"What is the capital of France?\" should be 98%. While we're still very confident that Paris is the current capital of France, the slight decrease accounts for the potential of historical changes and acknowledges that our knowledge might not be absolutely perfect.",
            "explanation": "This example demonstrates how GCP can lead to more nuanced confidence estimates. The initial direct prompting resulted in 100% confidence, which might be an overestimation. Through the gradient step, the model considers historical context, leading to a slight decrease in confidence. The final update step produces a high but not perfect confidence score, which is likely more realistic and better calibrated."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed GCP method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the confidence 'gradients' generated by the model to gain insights into how LLMs reason about their own uncertainty. This could involve categorizing the types of variations that lead to the largest confidence changes and examining patterns across different question types. Second, we could explore combining GCP with other techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration via fine-tuning, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could investigate whether the GCP process itself, even if not improving overall calibration, leads to more informative uncertainty estimates by providing a distribution of confidences rather than a single point estimate. This could turn the project into an analysis of the multidimensional nature of LLM uncertainty, potentially leading to new metrics for evaluating model confidence beyond traditional calibration measures."
