        "Title": "Conceptual Compression Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for complex, multi-faceted queries that involve numerous concepts and relationships. This limitation hinders their reliability and applicability in scenarios requiring precise confidence estimation.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically treat queries holistically or use simple decomposition strategies that may not capture conceptual interdependencies. By 'compressing' complex queries into their core conceptual components and relationships, we can better isolate and quantify sources of uncertainty. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to understand and manipulate abstract concepts, potentially leading to more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Conceptual Compression Prompting (CCP), a novel prompting method consisting of five key steps: 1) Conceptual Mapping: Prompt the LLM to identify key concepts and relationships within the query, creating a conceptual graph. 2) Compression: Guide the LLM to iteratively simplify this graph, merging related concepts and removing redundancies until a minimal representation is achieved. 3) Uncertainty Localization: For each node and edge in the compressed graph, prompt the LLM to provide a localized uncertainty estimate. 4) Propagation Analysis: Prompt the LLM to analyze how uncertainties propagate through the compressed conceptual structure. 5) Holistic Uncertainty Synthesis: Finally, guide the LLM to synthesize these localized and propagated uncertainties into a calibrated overall estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from domains like science and law. Specifically, we'll use the SciQ dataset for scientific reasoning and the Legal USMLE dataset for legal reasoning. These datasets contain complex, multi-faceted questions that are suitable for our experiment.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting: Directly ask the LLM to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate. b) Simple decomposition: Break down the question into simpler sub-questions, get answers and confidences for each, then aggregate. c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use CoT to generate a reasoning chain, then ask for a final answer and confidence.",
            "Step 3: CCP Implementation": "Implement the five steps of Conceptual Compression Prompting: a) Conceptual Mapping: Prompt: \"Identify the key concepts and their relationships in this question: [QUESTION]\". b) Compression: Prompt: \"Simplify the conceptual map by merging related concepts and removing redundancies. Provide the compressed version.\". c) Uncertainty Localization: Prompt: \"For each concept and relationship in the compressed map, provide a confidence score (0-100) and brief explanation.\". d) Propagation Analysis: Prompt: \"Analyze how the uncertainties in each concept and relationship affect the overall uncertainty of the answer.\". e) Holistic Uncertainty Synthesis: Prompt: \"Based on the localized uncertainties and their propagation, provide a final answer to the original question with an overall confidence score (0-100) and explanation.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 for our primary experiments, as it has shown superior performance in complex reasoning tasks. We will also run comparative experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess the method's generalizability.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Answer Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. b) Calibration Error: The difference between the model's confidence and its actual accuracy. c) Brier Score: A proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. d) Conceptual Compression Quality: Manual evaluation of a subset of compressed conceptual maps for relevance and conciseness.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Apply each baseline method and record the answer, confidence, and time taken. b) Apply CCP and record the intermediate outputs of each step, final answer, confidence, and time taken. c) Calculate the evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of CCP against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze the quality and relevance of the compressed conceptual maps. c) Examine how uncertainty propagates through the conceptual structure in CCP. d) Investigate cases where CCP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: In a civil lawsuit, what is the standard of proof required for a plaintiff to prevail, and how does this differ from criminal cases? Provide your answer and a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "A: In a civil lawsuit, the standard of proof required for a plaintiff to prevail is \"preponderance of the evidence.\" This means that the plaintiff must prove that their claim is more likely to be true than not, or that there is a greater than 50% chance that their claim is true. This differs from criminal cases, where the standard of proof is \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is a much higher standard. In criminal cases, the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt to such a degree that there is no reasonable doubt in the mind of a rational person. Confidence score: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP Step 1: Conceptual Mapping)": "Identify the key concepts and their relationships in this question: In a civil lawsuit, what is the standard of proof required for a plaintiff to prevail, and how does this differ from criminal cases?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP Step 1: Conceptual Mapping)": "Key Concepts and Relationships:\n1. Civil lawsuit\n2. Standard of proof\n3. Plaintiff\n4. Prevailing in a case\n5. Criminal cases\n6. Difference between civil and criminal standards\n\nRelationships:\n- Standard of proof is required in civil lawsuits\n- Plaintiff must meet the standard of proof to prevail\n- Civil lawsuits have a different standard of proof compared to criminal cases",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP Step 2: Compression)": "Simplify the conceptual map by merging related concepts and removing redundancies. Provide the compressed version.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP Step 2: Compression)": "Compressed Conceptual Map:\n1. Civil standard of proof\n2. Criminal standard of proof\n3. Comparison between civil and criminal standards",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP Step 3: Uncertainty Localization)": "For each concept and relationship in the compressed map, provide a confidence score (0-100) and brief explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP Step 3: Uncertainty Localization)": "1. Civil standard of proof:\nConfidence: 95\nExplanation: Very confident about the \"preponderance of evidence\" standard in civil cases.\n\n2. Criminal standard of proof:\nConfidence: 98\nExplanation: Highly confident about the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard in criminal cases.\n\n3. Comparison between civil and criminal standards:\nConfidence: 90\nExplanation: Confident about the general differences, but there might be some nuances or exceptions I'm less certain about.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP Step 4: Propagation Analysis)": "Analyze how the uncertainties in each concept and relationship affect the overall uncertainty of the answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP Step 4: Propagation Analysis)": "The uncertainties in the individual concepts have a cumulative effect on the overall uncertainty of the answer. The high confidence in both civil and criminal standards of proof (95 and 98 respectively) provides a strong foundation for the answer. However, the slightly lower confidence (90) in the comparison between the two introduces some uncertainty in the overall response. This uncertainty mainly stems from potential nuances or exceptions in how these standards are applied in different jurisdictions or specific case types. The overall uncertainty is relatively low, but it's important to acknowledge that there might be some aspects of the comparison that are not captured in a general explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP Step 5: Holistic Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the localized uncertainties and their propagation, provide a final answer to the original question with an overall confidence score (0-100) and explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP Step 5: Holistic Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final Answer: In a civil lawsuit, the standard of proof required for a plaintiff to prevail is \"preponderance of the evidence.\" This means the plaintiff must prove that their claim is more likely true than not, often described as being greater than 50% likely. This differs significantly from criminal cases, where the standard is \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is a much higher bar. In criminal cases, the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt to such a degree that there is no reasonable doubt in the mind of a rational person.\n\nOverall Confidence Score: 93\n\nExplanation: The high confidence in understanding both civil and criminal standards of proof contributes significantly to the overall confidence. The slight reduction in confidence comes from the comparison between the two, where there might be some nuances or rare exceptions not covered in this general explanation. Despite this, the fundamental difference between the two standards is well-established in legal practice, leading to a high overall confidence in the answer.",
            "explanation": "CCP allows for a more nuanced and structured approach to uncertainty quantification. By breaking down the question into key concepts, compressing them, and analyzing uncertainties at each level, it provides a more detailed and potentially more accurate confidence assessment compared to standard prompting. The final answer not only provides the information but also gives insight into where the uncertainties lie."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why CCP fails, which could provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning processes. 2) Experiment with variations of CCP, such as different compression strategies or uncertainty propagation methods. 3) Investigate how CCP performs across different types of questions or domains, which could lead to a paper on the strengths and limitations of conceptual compression in LLM reasoning. 4) Explore combining CCP with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to create a hybrid approach. 5) Analyze the generated conceptual maps and their compressions to gain insights into how LLMs represent and manipulate abstract concepts, which could be valuable for the broader NLP community."
