        "Title": "Exploring Semantic Neighborhoods for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence, especially when dealing with nuanced or borderline cases in classification or decision-making tasks. This issue can lead to overconfident predictions in uncertain situations or underconfident predictions in clear-cut cases, potentially limiting the reliability and applicability of these models in critical domains.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence calibration typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs. However, these approaches may not fully capture the nuanced decision boundaries that exist in complex language tasks. By exploring the semantic neighborhood of a given input, we can potentially gain deeper insights into the model's decision boundaries and the stability of its predictions. This approach is inspired by the human cognitive process of considering similar cases when assessing confidence in a decision. We hypothesize that this method will lead to more accurate confidence estimates by providing a richer context for the model's decision-making process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting method that explores the semantic neighborhood of inputs to calibrate confidence:\n1. Given an input query and initial response, prompt the model to generate semantically similar variants of the input.\n2. For each variant, ask the model to classify it and provide a confidence score.\n3. Prompt the model to analyze the pattern of predictions and confidences across the semantic neighborhood, identifying stable regions and boundary cases.\n4. Based on this analysis, ask the model to revise its confidence for the original input, explaining how the neighborhood exploration influenced its assessment.\n5. Iterate this process, gradually expanding the semantic neighborhood and refining the confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that involve classification tasks with nuanced categories or fuzzy boundaries. We will use:\n1. The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) for sentiment analysis\n2. The TREC dataset for question classification\n3. A subset of the GLUE diagnostic dataset for natural language inference",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods:\n1. Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its prediction.\n2. Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings in the model's softmax output to calibrate confidence.\n3. Ensemble method: Use predictions from multiple model runs to estimate confidence.",
            "Step 3: Semantic Neighborhood Exploration": "Implement the proposed method:\n1. Initial classification: Prompt the model to classify the input and provide an initial confidence score.\n2. Variant generation: Prompt the model to generate 5-10 semantically similar variants of the input.\n3. Variant classification: For each variant, prompt the model to classify and provide a confidence score.\n4. Neighborhood analysis: Prompt the model to analyze the pattern of predictions and confidences across the variants.\n5. Confidence revision: Based on the analysis, prompt the model to revise its confidence for the original input.\n6. Iteration: Repeat steps 2-5 for 2-3 iterations, expanding the semantic neighborhood each time.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the method. Example prompts:\n1. Variant generation: \"Generate 5 sentences that are semantically similar to '[input]' but with slight variations in wording or structure.\"\n2. Neighborhood analysis: \"Analyze the pattern of predictions and confidences for the original input and its variants. Identify any stable regions or boundary cases.\"\n3. Confidence revision: \"Based on your analysis of the semantic neighborhood, revise your confidence for the original input. Explain how the neighborhood exploration influenced your assessment.\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments. We will also test GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) to compare performance across model sizes.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of the baseline methods and the proposed method using standard calibration metrics:\n1. Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n2. Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)\n3. Brier Score\n4. Reliability diagrams\nAdditionally, conduct a qualitative analysis of the model's explanations for confidence revisions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare the calibration performance of the proposed method against the baselines across different datasets and tasks.\n2. Analyze how the size and diversity of the explored semantic neighborhood affects calibration performance.\n3. Investigate the impact of the number of iterations on calibration accuracy and computational cost.\n4. Examine the model's explanations for confidence revisions to gain insights into its decision-making process."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Classify the sentiment of the following movie review as positive or negative, and provide your confidence level (0-100%):\n'The film had its moments, but overall it felt like a missed opportunity.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Classification: Negative\nConfidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Classification)": "Classify the sentiment of the following movie review as positive or negative, and provide your confidence level (0-100%):\n'The film had its moments, but overall it felt like a missed opportunity.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Classification)": "Classification: Negative\nConfidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Variant Generation)": "Generate 5 sentences that are semantically similar to 'The film had its moments, but overall it felt like a missed opportunity.' but with slight variations in wording or structure.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Variant Generation)": "1. 'While the movie had some good parts, it ultimately didn't live up to expectations.'\n2. 'There were glimpses of potential, but the film as a whole was disappointing.'\n3. 'Despite a few standout scenes, the movie largely failed to deliver.'\n4. 'The film showed promise at times, yet it fell short in its overall execution.'\n5. 'Although not without merit, the movie left me feeling it could have been much better.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Variant Classification)": "Classify the sentiment of each of the following movie reviews as positive or negative, and provide your confidence level (0-100%) for each:\n1. 'While the movie had some good parts, it ultimately didn't live up to expectations.'\n2. 'There were glimpses of potential, but the film as a whole was disappointing.'\n3. 'Despite a few standout scenes, the movie largely failed to deliver.'\n4. 'The film showed promise at times, yet it fell short in its overall execution.'\n5. 'Although not without merit, the movie left me feeling it could have been much better.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Variant Classification)": "1. Classification: Negative, Confidence: 80%\n2. Classification: Negative, Confidence: 85%\n3. Classification: Negative, Confidence: 90%\n4. Classification: Negative, Confidence: 80%\n5. Classification: Negative, Confidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Neighborhood Analysis)": "Analyze the pattern of predictions and confidences for the original input and its variants. Identify any stable regions or boundary cases.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Neighborhood Analysis)": "Analysis:\n1. Stable region: All variants are consistently classified as negative, indicating a stable region in the semantic space around the original input.\n2. Confidence range: Confidences range from 75% to 90%, suggesting some variability in the strength of the negative sentiment.\n3. Boundary cases: None of the variants appear to be boundary cases, as they all lean clearly towards negative sentiment.\n4. Nuance: The consistent mention of positive aspects (e.g., 'had its moments', 'glimpses of potential', 'standout scenes') alongside overall negative judgments suggests a nuanced sentiment that isn't strongly negative.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Confidence Revision)": "Based on your analysis of the semantic neighborhood, revise your confidence for the original input ('The film had its moments, but overall it felt like a missed opportunity.'). Explain how the neighborhood exploration influenced your assessment.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Confidence Revision)": "Revised Classification: Negative\nRevised Confidence: 82%\n\nExplanation: The exploration of the semantic neighborhood has increased my confidence in the negative classification, but also highlighted the nuanced nature of the sentiment. The consistent negative classifications across all variants support the original assessment. However, the range of confidences (75% to 90%) suggests that while the sentiment is clearly negative, it's not extremely so. The persistent mention of positive aspects in all variants reinforces that this is a nuanced negative review rather than an overwhelmingly negative one. Therefore, I've increased my confidence slightly from the original 75% to 82%, reflecting the consistent negative lean while acknowledging the complexity of the sentiment expressed."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed semantic neighborhood exploration method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the generated semantic variants to understand how the model perceives semantic similarity and how this relates to the task at hand. This could provide insights into the model's understanding of the problem space.\n2. Investigate the relationship between semantic distance and confidence scores. We could plot confidence scores against some measure of semantic similarity to the original input, potentially revealing patterns in how the model's confidence changes as we move through the semantic space.\n3. Explore alternative ways of leveraging the semantic neighborhood information. For instance, we could try weighting the variants based on their semantic similarity to the original input when aggregating confidence scores.\n4. Combine our method with existing calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if there are complementary benefits.\n5. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify specific types of inputs or tasks where our method performs particularly well or poorly. This could lead to insights about when semantic neighborhood exploration is most beneficial for confidence calibration.\n6. Expand the analysis to include not just confidence calibration, but also the accuracy of the model's predictions. We could investigate whether exploring the semantic neighborhood improves the model's ability to correct initial misclassifications.\nBy pursuing these alternative directions, we can ensure that even if the original hypothesis doesn't hold, the project still yields valuable insights into how large language models reason about confidence and semantic relationships."
