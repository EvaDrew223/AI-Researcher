    "idea_name": "Meta-Prompt Uncertainty Decomposition",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in large language models often treat uncertainty as a monolithic concept, failing to distinguish between different sources or types of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically output a single uncertainty score or confidence value for a given prediction.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing uncertainty into its constituent components, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence and potentially improve calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Meta-Prompt Uncertainty Decomposition (MPUD), a novel prompting technique that uses the language model itself to break down its uncertainty into different categories. The process involves a series of meta-prompts that ask the model to analyze its own response and uncertainty. For example, after generating an initial response, we might prompt: 'Analyze your previous response and break down your uncertainty into the following categories: 1) Lack of knowledge, 2) Ambiguity in the question, 3) Conflicting information, 4) Reasoning uncertainty. Provide a percentage for each category and explain your reasoning.' We then use additional prompts to probe each uncertainty category further. This method leverages the model's language understanding capabilities to provide a more detailed and potentially more accurate picture of its uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MPUD against standard uncertainty quantification methods on a diverse set of tasks. We'll use traditional metrics like calibration error and AUROC, but also develop new metrics to assess the quality and consistency of the uncertainty decomposition. We'll also conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different meta-prompt designs and compare the decomposed uncertainty estimates with human expert assessments."

        "Title": "Meta-Prompt Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often treat uncertainty as a monolithic concept, failing to distinguish between different sources or types of uncertainty. This limits our understanding of model confidence and hinders effective calibration.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically output a single uncertainty score or confidence value for a given prediction, which oversimplifies the complex nature of model uncertainty. By decomposing uncertainty into its constituent components, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence and potentially improve calibration. Our method leverages the language model's own capabilities to analyze and break down its uncertainty, providing a more detailed and potentially more accurate picture of its confidence levels.",

                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 0.95",

                "Step 2 - Uncertainty Decomposition": "Uncertainty breakdown:\n1) Lack of knowledge: 5%\n2) Ambiguity in the question: 0%\n3) Conflicting information: 0%\n4) Reasoning uncertainty: 2%\nTotal uncertainty: 7%",
                "Step 3 - Category Probing": "Lack of knowledge (5%): While I'm very confident about this answer, there's always a small chance that my information could be outdated.\nAmbiguity in the question (0%): The question is clear and unambiguous.\nConflicting information (0%): I don't have any conflicting information about this fact.\nReasoning uncertainty (2%): The reasoning required for this question is straightforward, but there's always a small chance of error in recall or processing.",
                "Explanation": "MPUD provides a detailed breakdown of uncertainty sources, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MPUD doesn't significantly improve calibration or provide meaningful uncertainty decompositions, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated uncertainty decompositions to understand why they might not be effective. This could involve comparing the decompositions across different types of questions, models, and difficulty levels to identify patterns or inconsistencies. Second, we could explore variations of the meta-prompting technique, such as using different uncertainty categories or prompting strategies, to see if certain approaches are more effective. Third, we could investigate how the uncertainty decompositions correlate with actual model errors, potentially leading to insights about model behavior and limitations. Finally, we could shift focus to using the uncertainty decompositions as a tool for model interpretability rather than calibration, analyzing how they reflect the model's reasoning process and knowledge gaps."
