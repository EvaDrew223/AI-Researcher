    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when presented with similar questions over time, indicating poor calibration.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on adjusting confidence scores based on historical accuracy, without explicitly considering temporal consistency.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts tend to maintain consistent confidence levels for similar questions over time, adjusting gradually as they gain or lose certainty. Probing for temporal consistency can reveal underlying calibration issues in language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing for Confidence Calibration (TCPCC), a dynamic prompting method that assesses and improves calibration over simulated time periods. The process begins by asking the model a series of related questions, with prompts indicating different time points (e.g., 'Answer this question as if it were asked yesterday, last week, and one month ago'). For each time point, the model provides an answer and confidence estimate. The model is then prompted to explain any discrepancies in its confidence across time points. Next, the model is asked to generate potential new information or experiences that would justify changes in confidence over time. Finally, the model reconciles these temporal perspectives to produce a calibrated confidence estimate, explaining how temporal consistency (or justified inconsistency) informs its final uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare TCPCC against standard calibration techniques on longitudinal question-answering datasets, where questions are repeated or variations are presented over time. Evaluate improvements in calibration consistency, the quality of temporal reasoning in uncertainty estimation, and the model's ability to explain confidence adjustments over time."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Probing for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often produce inconsistent confidence estimates when presented with similar questions over time, indicating poor calibration. This inconsistency undermines the reliability of these models in real-world applications where consistent and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods typically focus on adjusting confidence scores based on historical accuracy, without explicitly considering temporal consistency. Human experts, in contrast, tend to maintain consistent confidence levels for similar questions over time, adjusting gradually as they gain or lose certainty. By probing for temporal consistency, we can reveal underlying calibration issues in language models and potentially improve their uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing for Confidence Calibration (TCPCC), a dynamic prompting method that assesses and improves calibration over simulated time periods. The process involves four main steps: 1) Asking the model a series of related questions with prompts indicating different time points. 2) Prompting the model to explain discrepancies in its confidence across time points. 3) Asking the model to generate potential new information or experiences that would justify changes in confidence over time. 4) Prompting the model to reconcile these temporal perspectives to produce a calibrated confidence estimate, explaining how temporal consistency (or justified inconsistency) informs its final uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of question sets, where each set contains related questions that could be asked at different time points. Use existing longitudinal question-answering datasets or create synthetic ones based on real-world knowledge domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard calibration techniques such as temperature scaling and Platt scaling as baselines.",
            "Step 3: TCPCC Implementation": "Implement the TCPCC method with the following sub-steps: a) Time-based question prompting, b) Discrepancy explanation prompting, c) New information generation prompting, d) Reconciliation and final calibration prompting.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question set in the dataset: a) Apply baseline methods, b) Apply TCPCC method, c) Record confidence estimates, explanations, and final answers for each method.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess performance using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. Also, evaluate the quality of temporal reasoning and explanations using human raters.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare TCPCC against baselines, analyzing improvements in calibration consistency, quality of temporal reasoning, and ability to explain confidence adjustments over time."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the population of New York City as of 2021?",
                "Output": "As of 2021, the population of New York City is approximately 8.8 million people. (Confidence: 90%)"
            },
            "TCPCC Method Example": {
                "Step 1 Input": "Answer the following question as if it were asked in 2021, 2022, and 2023: What is the population of New York City?",
                "Step 1 Output": "2021: As of 2021, the population of New York City is approximately 8.8 million people. (Confidence: 90%)\n2022: As of 2022, the population of New York City is approximately 8.9 million people. (Confidence: 85%)\n2023: As of 2023, the population of New York City is approximately 8.85 million people. (Confidence: 80%)",
                "Step 2 Input": "Explain the discrepancies in your confidence across these time points.",
                "Step 2 Output": "The discrepancies in confidence across time points reflect the increasing uncertainty as we move further from the last official census in 2020. In 2021, the estimate is closer to the census data, hence higher confidence. For 2022 and 2023, factors like population fluctuations due to the pandemic, migration patterns, and lack of recent official data contribute to decreased confidence.",
                "Step 3 Input": "Generate potential new information or experiences that would justify changes in confidence over time for this question.",
                "Step 3 Output": "1. A new official population estimate released by the U.S. Census Bureau in late 2022.\n2. Reports of significant migration patterns in or out of New York City due to economic factors or policy changes.\n3. A major event (e.g., a natural disaster) affecting New York City's population.\n4. Improved data collection methods providing more accurate real-time population estimates.",
                "Step 4 Input": "Based on your previous answers and explanations, provide a final calibrated confidence estimate for the population of New York City as of 2023, explaining how temporal consistency informs your uncertainty quantification.",
                "Step 4 Output": "As of 2023, I estimate the population of New York City to be approximately 8.85 million people, with a calibrated confidence of 82%. This confidence level takes into account the temporal consistency of available data and potential new information. While the confidence decreases over time due to increasing uncertainty, the rate of decrease is moderated by the city's relatively stable population trends and the potential for new data releases. The slight increase from the 2023 estimate (80% to 82%) reflects the reconciliation of temporal perspectives and the acknowledgment that some new information, such as interim population estimates or migration reports, may have become available, slightly improving our confidence without returning it to earlier levels."
            },
            "Explanation": "The TCPCC method provides a more nuanced and temporally consistent confidence estimate compared to the baseline method. It explicitly considers how confidence changes over time and provides reasoning for these changes, leading to a more reliable and interpretable uncertainty quantification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCPCC does not significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of how language models reason about temporal consistency in confidence estimation. This could involve: 1) Analyzing the types of explanations and justifications the model provides for confidence changes over time. 2) Investigating how different prompting strategies affect the model's temporal reasoning abilities. 3) Exploring how the model's performance varies across different types of questions or knowledge domains. 4) Conducting ablation studies to determine which components of TCPCC contribute most to any observed improvements. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of language models in reasoning about uncertainty over time, potentially informing future approaches to improving calibration and temporal consistency in these models."
