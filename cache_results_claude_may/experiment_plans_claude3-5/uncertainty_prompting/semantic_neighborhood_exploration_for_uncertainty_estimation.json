    "idea_name": "Semantic Neighborhood Exploration for Uncertainty Estimation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty, especially for queries that lie at the boundaries of their knowledge or involve subtle distinctions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or analysis of model outputs without explicitly probing the semantic neighborhood of a query.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring the semantic neighborhood of a query, we can gain insights into the model's uncertainty landscape and potentially improve calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a prompting technique that guides the model to generate and analyze semantically related queries. The prompt structure includes: '1. Generate the initial answer and confidence estimate. 2. Create five semantically related queries by slightly modifying the original question. 3. Provide answers and confidence estimates for each related query. 4. Analyze the variation in answers and confidence across the semantic neighborhood. 5. Refine the original confidence estimate based on this analysis.' This approach encourages the model to consider subtle variations and boundary cases, potentially leading to more nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SNE against standard confidence elicitation methods on tasks involving fine-grained distinctions, such as legal or medical question answering. Evaluate using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier Score, and measures of discrimination between high and low confidence predictions."

        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Exploration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty, especially for queries that lie at the boundaries of their knowledge or involve subtle distinctions. This issue can lead to overconfident predictions on unfamiliar topics or underconfident responses to questions within their knowledge domain, potentially misleading users and limiting the models' practical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or analysis of model outputs without explicitly probing the semantic neighborhood of a query. By exploring the semantic neighborhood of a query, we can gain insights into the model's uncertainty landscape and potentially improve calibration. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often consider related scenarios or slight variations of a problem to gauge our confidence in an answer.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a prompting technique that guides the model to generate and analyze semantically related queries. The prompt structure includes: '1. Generate the initial answer and confidence estimate. 2. Create five semantically related queries by slightly modifying the original question. 3. Provide answers and confidence estimates for each related query. 4. Analyze the variation in answers and confidence across the semantic neighborhood. 5. Refine the original confidence estimate based on this analysis.' This approach encourages the model to consider subtle variations and boundary cases, potentially leading to more nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MedQA for medical domain questions, and 3) LegalQA for legal domain questions. These datasets cover a range of domains and question types, allowing us to test the method's generalizability.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: simply ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: use different temperature settings to generate multiple outputs and estimate uncertainty. 3) Ensemble method: use multiple model instances or different models to generate answers and estimate uncertainty based on agreement.",
            "Step 3: Implement SNE": "Develop a prompt template for the Semantic Neighborhood Exploration method. The template should include instructions for each step of the SNE process, including generating related queries, providing answers and confidence estimates for each, analyzing variations, and refining the original estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and SNE), generate answers and uncertainty estimates for all questions. Store the outputs, including intermediate steps for SNE, for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure overall calibration. 2) Brier Score to assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) to measure discrimination between correct and incorrect answers. 4) F1 score to evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall in binary decision scenarios.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of SNE against baselines across different datasets and metrics. 2) Analysis of how SNE performance varies with the number and type of related queries generated. 3) Examination of cases where SNE significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines. 4) Investigation of the relationship between semantic neighborhood consistency and uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please follow these steps:\n1. Provide your initial answer and confidence estimate.\n2. Generate five semantically related queries by slightly modifying the original question.\n3. Provide answers and confidence estimates for each related query.\n4. Analyze the variation in answers and confidence across the semantic neighborhood.\n5. Refine your original confidence estimate based on this analysis.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Initial answer: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence: 95\n\n2. Related queries:\na) What is the largest city in France?\nb) What is the seat of the French government?\nc) What was the capital of France in the 18th century?\nd) Which city hosts the French Parliament?\ne) What is the most populous city in France?\n\n3. Answers and confidence for related queries:\na) Paris. Confidence: 95\nb) Paris. Confidence: 90\nc) Paris. Confidence: 85\nd) Paris. Confidence: 90\ne) Paris. Confidence: 95\n\n4. Analysis: All related queries point to Paris as the answer, with high confidence levels ranging from 85 to 95. The slight variations in confidence reflect the historical aspect (18th century capital) and the specific governmental functions (seat of government, host of Parliament).\n\n5. Refined confidence estimate: 98. The consistency across semantically related queries, including historical and governmental aspects, increases my confidence in the original answer.",
            "Explanation": "The SNE method provides a more comprehensive analysis of the model's knowledge and uncertainty. By exploring related questions, it can identify potential areas of confusion or uncertainty, leading to a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence estimate. In this case, the consistency across related queries led to an increase in confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SNE method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated semantic neighborhoods to understand why they didn't lead to improved calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of related queries generated and their relationship to the original question. 2) Investigate whether SNE performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when semantic exploration is most useful. 3) Experiment with different ways of aggregating information from the semantic neighborhood, such as weighted averaging based on semantic similarity or using the variance in confidence estimates as an additional signal. 4) Explore combining SNE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it as a fine-tuning step after temperature scaling. 5) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where SNE performs particularly well or poorly, which could provide insights into the strengths and limitations of the approach and suggest future research directions."
