        "Problem": "LLMs often have poorly defined boundaries between areas of high and low confidence, leading to overconfidence in edge cases.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on estimating confidence for given queries rather than explicitly mapping the boundaries of a model's confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically probing and mapping the boundaries of a model's confidence, we can create a more nuanced understanding of when and how a model transitions from certainty to uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Boundary Mapping, an iterative prompting technique designed to precisely locate and characterize a model's confidence boundaries. The process begins with a high-confidence query and a related low-confidence query. We then use a binary search-like algorithm in the semantic space between these queries, generating intermediate queries and prompting the model for confidence estimates. This process iteratively narrows in on the confidence boundary. Once a boundary is identified, we use adversarial perturbations around this boundary, prompting the model to explain why small changes cause shifts in confidence. These explanations are used to characterize the nature of the confidence boundary (e.g., sharp vs. gradual, stable vs. volatile). Finally, we aggregate these boundary maps across many query pairs to create a global confidence boundary landscape for the model.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on a range of tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and specialized domain knowledge. We'll compare the accuracy and granularity of our confidence boundary maps against traditional confidence estimation methods. Evaluation metrics will include a new measure of boundary sharpness and stability, as well as the model's ability to correctly classify new queries as within or outside its confidence boundaries."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Boundary Mapping: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit poorly defined boundaries between areas of high and low confidence, leading to overconfidence in edge cases. This makes it challenging to reliably assess when a model's output should be trusted or when it might be generating unreliable information.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically focus on estimating confidence for given queries rather than explicitly mapping the boundaries of a model's confidence. By systematically probing and mapping the boundaries of a model's confidence, we can create a more nuanced understanding of when and how a model transitions from certainty to uncertainty. This approach could provide valuable insights into model behavior and help improve the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Boundary Mapping (ACBM), an iterative prompting technique designed to precisely locate and characterize a model's confidence boundaries. The process begins with a high-confidence query and a related low-confidence query. We then use a binary search-like algorithm in the semantic space between these queries, generating intermediate queries and prompting the model for confidence estimates. This process iteratively narrows in on the confidence boundary. Once a boundary is identified, we use adversarial perturbations around this boundary, prompting the model to explain why small changes cause shifts in confidence. These explanations are used to characterize the nature of the confidence boundary (e.g., sharp vs. gradual, stable vs. volatile). Finally, we aggregate these boundary maps across many query pairs to create a global confidence boundary landscape for the model.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: (1) TriviaQA for factual QA, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) MedQA for specialized domain knowledge. From each dataset, select 100 question-answer pairs with high model confidence (>90%) and 100 with low confidence (<50%) based on preliminary model queries.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Confidence Estimation": "Implement traditional confidence estimation methods: (1) Softmax probabilities, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (3) Ensemble disagreement. Apply these methods to all questions in our datasets.",
            "Step 4: Implement ACBM": "For each high-confidence and low-confidence query pair: (a) Generate intermediate queries using word substitutions and sentence transformations. (b) Query the model with these intermediate queries and record confidence scores. (c) Use binary search to identify the confidence boundary. (d) Apply small perturbations around the boundary and collect model explanations for confidence shifts.",
            "Step 5: Boundary Characterization": "Analyze the collected data to characterize each boundary: (a) Sharpness: Calculate the gradient of confidence change around the boundary. (b) Stability: Measure how much the boundary shifts under small perturbations. (c) Semantic coherence: Use embedding similarity to assess how semantically close the boundary queries are to the original high/low confidence queries.",
            "Step 6: Global Confidence Landscape": "Aggregate individual boundary maps to create a global confidence landscape. Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE) to visualize this landscape in 2D or 3D space.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Compare ACBM against baseline methods: (a) Accuracy: Ability to correctly classify new queries as within or outside confidence boundaries. (b) Granularity: Measure the level of detail in confidence estimates. (c) Interpretability: Assess the quality and usefulness of model explanations at boundary points.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: (a) Compare confidence landscapes across different tasks and models. (b) Identify patterns in the types of queries that tend to fall on confidence boundaries. (c) Analyze the semantic nature of confidence transitions in different areas of the task space."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 99",
                "Explanation": "Traditional methods typically provide a single confidence score without exploring the boundaries of the model's knowledge."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Input": "Initial high-confidence query: What is the capital of France?\nInitial low-confidence query: What was the population of Paris in 1820?\nGenerate an intermediate query that might lie on the confidence boundary between these two.",
                "Output": "Intermediate query: What was the population of France in 1820?\nConfidence: 70\nExplanation: This query lies between the two initial queries in terms of specificity and historical knowledge required. It's related to France like the high-confidence query, but requires specific historical data like the low-confidence query.",
                "Explanation": "ACBM generates intermediate queries to probe the confidence boundary, providing more nuanced insights into the model's knowledge boundaries."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ACBM method doesn't satisfy our success criteria, we can pivot our research in several ways. First, we could focus on analyzing why the method failed, which might reveal interesting insights about LLM behavior at the edges of their knowledge. We could examine patterns in the types of queries where ACBM struggled to identify clear boundaries, potentially uncovering blind spots in model training or evaluation. Additionally, we could explore combining ACBM with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using ACBM to guide more targeted applications of techniques like Monte Carlo Dropout or ensemble methods. Another direction could be to use the data generated by ACBM attempts to train a secondary model for predicting LLM confidence, turning this into a meta-learning project. Finally, we could shift focus to use ACBM as a tool for analyzing and comparing different LLMs, providing a new lens for model evaluation and comparison even if it doesn't outperform existing confidence estimation methods."
