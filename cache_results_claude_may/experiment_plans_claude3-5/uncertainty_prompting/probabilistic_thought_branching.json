        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately represent their uncertainty across multiple potential reasoning paths, often committing to a single line of thought even when unsure.",
        "Existing Methods": "Chain-of-thought prompting and its variants typically produce a single reasoning chain.",
        "Motivation": "Human reasoning often involves considering multiple possibilities with varying degrees of confidence. By mimicking this process, LLMs could better represent their uncertainty across different potential answers.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Thought Branching (PTB), a prompting technique that encourages LLMs to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Generate an initial set of possible answers. 2) For each answer, produce a reasoning chain, assigning subjective probabilities to each step. 3) Calculate the final probability for each answer based on the product of step probabilities. 4) Iteratively refine the most promising branches by prompting for alternative sub-steps or additional evidence. This process creates a tree of thought with probabilistic weights, allowing for a more nuanced representation of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare PTB against standard prompting, chain-of-thought, and tree-of-thought methods on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and BigBench. Evaluate using both accuracy and calibration metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE) and Brier score."

        "Title": "Probabilistic Thought Branching: Enhancing Uncertainty Representation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately represent their uncertainty across multiple potential reasoning paths, often committing to a single line of thought even when unsure. This limitation hinders their ability to provide nuanced responses and accurately convey confidence levels in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like chain-of-thought prompting typically produce a single reasoning chain, which fails to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty inherent in many complex problems. Human reasoning often involves considering multiple possibilities with varying degrees of confidence. By mimicking this process through Probabilistic Thought Branching (PTB), LLMs could better represent their uncertainty across different potential answers, leading to more accurate and calibrated responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Thought Branching (PTB), a prompting technique that encourages LLMs to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. The process involves four main steps: 1) Generate an initial set of possible answers. 2) For each answer, produce a reasoning chain, assigning subjective probabilities to each step. 3) Calculate the final probability for each answer based on the product of step probabilities. 4) Iteratively refine the most promising branches by prompting for alternative sub-steps or additional evidence. This process creates a tree of thought with probabilistic weights, allowing for a more nuanced representation of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and BigBench. Focus on problems that have multiple possible solution paths or require nuanced reasoning. Prepare a diverse set of 100-200 questions from each dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Chain-of-thought prompting, and c) Tree-of-thought prompting. Use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as the base models for all experiments.",
            "Step 3: PTB Implementation": "Implement the Probabilistic Thought Branching method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial answer generation, b) Reasoning chain production with step probabilities, c) Final probability calculation, and d) Iterative refinement of promising branches.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the PTB process. For example: 'Generate 3-5 possible answers to this question:', 'For each answer, provide a step-by-step reasoning chain, assigning a probability to each step:', 'Calculate the final probability for each answer based on the step probabilities:', 'For the top two most probable answers, generate alternative reasoning steps or additional evidence to refine the probability.'",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments using both baseline methods and PTB on the prepared datasets. Use GPT-4 and Claude 2 for all experiments. For each question, record the model's final answer, confidence score, and full reasoning process.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the results using both accuracy and calibration metrics. For accuracy, use the standard metrics for each dataset (e.g., exact match for MATH). For calibration, calculate the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score. Compare the performance of PTB against the baseline methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze the results to understand: a) How PTB affects the model's accuracy compared to baselines, b) Whether PTB improves calibration and uncertainty representation, c) The impact of the number of initial branches and refinement iterations on performance, d) Any patterns in the types of problems where PTB shows the most improvement."

Let's solve by factoring:\n   2(w^2(w + 3) - 180) = 0\n   2(w^2(w + 3) - 60 * 3) = 0\n   2((w^2 * w + 3w^2) - (60w + 180)) = 0\n   2(w^3 + 3w^2 - 60w - 180) = 0\n   w^3 + 3w^2 - 60w - 180 = 0\n   (w + 10)(w^2 - 7w - 18) = 0\n   (w + 10)(w - 9)(w + 2) = 0\n\n7) The solutions are w = -10, w = 9, or w = -2.

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Probabilistic Thought Branching method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated thought branches to understand why they didn't lead to better performance. This could involve examining the diversity of the initial answer sets, the accuracy of the assigned probabilities, and the effectiveness of the refinement process. We might discover that the method is more effective for certain types of problems or that it requires modifications to the prompting strategy. Second, we could explore hybrid approaches that combine PTB with other techniques like retrieval-augmented generation or self-consistency checking. This could lead to insights about how different uncertainty quantification methods interact and complement each other. Finally, we could shift focus to analyzing how PTB affects the model's explanation generation and interpretability, even if it doesn't directly improve accuracy or calibration. This could provide valuable insights into how explicit uncertainty representation influences the quality and usefulness of model-generated explanations."
