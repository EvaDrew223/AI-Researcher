        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to accurately represent uncertainty, especially for inputs that are slightly different from their training distribution.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods often rely on sampling-based approaches or direct confidence elicitation, which may not capture subtle variations in input that could affect model confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically perturbing input prompts and analyzing the variance in model outputs, we can gain insight into the model's sensitivity to input variations and use this to quantify uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Prompt Perturbation Uncertainty Quantification (PPUQ): 1) Generate a set of perturbed prompts by applying controlled semantic and syntactic modifications to the original input. 2) Query the model with each perturbed prompt. 3) Analyze the distribution of outputs using techniques from information theory (e.g., entropy, mutual information) to quantify uncertainty. 4) Use this uncertainty measure to calibrate the model's confidence in its original output. The method includes a novel prompt perturbation strategy that preserves core meaning while introducing controlled variations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate PPUQ against standard confidence estimation methods on tasks including question-answering and text classification. Measure performance using calibration metrics and the ability to identify out-of-distribution inputs."

        "Title": "Prompt Perturbation Uncertainty Quantification: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to accurately represent uncertainty, especially for inputs that are slightly different from their training distribution. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications and hinder the safe deployment of these models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on sampling-based approaches or direct confidence elicitation, which may not capture subtle variations in input that could affect model confidence. By systematically perturbing input prompts and analyzing the variance in model outputs, we can gain insight into the model's sensitivity to input variations and use this to quantify uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's own behavior to estimate uncertainty, potentially providing a more accurate and nuanced measure of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Prompt Perturbation Uncertainty Quantification (PPUQ), a method that consists of four main steps: 1) Generate a set of perturbed prompts by applying controlled semantic and syntactic modifications to the original input. 2) Query the model with each perturbed prompt. 3) Analyze the distribution of outputs using techniques from information theory (e.g., entropy, mutual information) to quantify uncertainty. 4) Use this uncertainty measure to calibrate the model's confidence in its original output. The method includes a novel prompt perturbation strategy that preserves core meaning while introducing controlled variations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: 1) SQuAD 2.0 for question-answering tasks, and 2) GLUE SST-2 for sentiment classification. These datasets provide a mix of tasks and allow for evaluation of both open-ended and classification scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and collect multiple predictions to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: PPUQ Implementation": "Implement the PPUQ method as follows: a) Develop a prompt perturbation function that generates semantically similar variations of the input prompt. Use techniques such as synonym replacement, sentence structure alteration, and adding/removing context. b) For each input, generate N perturbed prompts (e.g., N=10). c) Query the model with each perturbed prompt and collect the outputs. d) Compute uncertainty metrics such as entropy and mutual information from the distribution of outputs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of PPUQ against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between confidence and accuracy. 2) Brier Score: Assesses the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) AUC-ROC for detecting out-of-distribution inputs: Use a separate OOD dataset (e.g., adversarial examples or questions from a different domain) to test if the uncertainty estimates can distinguish in-distribution from out-of-distribution inputs.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct additional analyses: 1) Ablation study on the number of perturbations (N) to determine the optimal trade-off between performance and computational cost. 2) Qualitative analysis of cases where PPUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. 3) Investigate the relationship between input complexity and uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 7: Reporting Results": "Compile the results into tables and graphs, showing the performance of PPUQ compared to baselines across different tasks and evaluation metrics. Include examples of perturbed prompts and corresponding uncertainty estimates to illustrate the method's behavior."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for a confidence score, which may be overconfident and not reflect true uncertainty."
            },
            "PPUQ Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Perturbed Prompts": [
                    "Q: Could you tell me the capital city of France?",
                    "Q: Which city serves as the capital of the country France?",
                    "Q: In France, what is considered the capital?",
                    "Q: What's the name of France's capital city?",
                    "Q: France has a capital city. What is it called?"
                ],
                "Outputs": [
                    "The capital of France is Paris.",
                    "Paris is the capital city of France.",
                    "The capital of France is Paris.",
                    "Paris is the capital of France.",
                    "The capital city of France is Paris."
                ],
                "Uncertainty Calculation": "Entropy of the output distribution: 0.1 (low uncertainty)",
                "Final Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Uncertainty: Low (0.1)",
                "Explanation": "PPUQ generates multiple perturbations of the input, analyzes the consistency of outputs, and provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate based on the model's sensitivity to input variations."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PPUQ does not significantly outperform baselines, we can explore several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the types of perturbations that lead to the most informative uncertainty estimates and refine our perturbation strategy. This might involve developing a more sophisticated perturbation method that considers task-specific knowledge. Second, we could investigate combining PPUQ with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or temperature scaling, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. Additionally, we could shift our focus to analyzing why certain inputs lead to high uncertainty estimates, potentially uncovering insights about the model's decision boundaries and limitations. This could lead to a valuable analysis paper on the nature of uncertainty in large language models and how it relates to input characteristics and model architecture."
