        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often rely on simplistic approaches like token probabilities or linguistic expressions of confidence, which may not capture the full complexity of model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Token probability-based methods and linguistic confidence elicitation are common baselines.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by latent space exploration in generative models, we hypothesize that a model's uncertainty is encoded in a high-dimensional latent space that can be probed and analyzed.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Latent Space Exploration (CLSE), a novel prompting technique that guides the model to project its uncertainty into a high-dimensional latent space. The process involves: 1) Prompting the model to generate a set of abstract 'confidence dimensions' (e.g., 'factual certainty', 'logical coherence', 'contextual relevance'). 2) For a given query, prompting the model to rate its confidence along each dimension. 3) Using these ratings to construct a latent confidence vector. 4) Prompting the model to analyze this vector, identifying clusters, outliers, and patterns. 5) Finally, prompting the model to synthesize this analysis into a nuanced uncertainty estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CLSE against baselines on standard uncertainty quantification benchmarks. Evaluate the method's ability to capture different aspects of uncertainty and its correlation with actual model performance. Analyze the emergent structure of the confidence latent space across different types of queries and tasks."

        "Title": "Confidence Latent Space Exploration (CLSE): A Novel Prompting Method for Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often rely on simplistic approaches like token probabilities or linguistic expressions of confidence, which may not capture the full complexity of model uncertainty. This research aims to develop a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to uncertainty quantification in LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like token probability-based approaches and linguistic confidence elicitation fail to capture the multidimensional nature of model uncertainty. Inspired by latent space exploration in generative models, we hypothesize that a model's uncertainty is encoded in a high-dimensional latent space that can be probed and analyzed. Our proposed method, Confidence Latent Space Exploration (CLSE), aims to guide the model to project its uncertainty into this latent space, allowing for a more nuanced and comprehensive uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "CLSE is a novel prompting technique that guides the model to project its uncertainty into a high-dimensional latent space. The process involves five steps: 1) Prompting the model to generate a set of abstract 'confidence dimensions' (e.g., 'factual certainty', 'logical coherence', 'contextual relevance'). 2) For a given query, prompting the model to rate its confidence along each dimension. 3) Using these ratings to construct a latent confidence vector. 4) Prompting the model to analyze this vector, identifying clusters, outliers, and patterns. 5) Finally, prompting the model to synthesize this analysis into a nuanced uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) LAMBADA for language modeling. These datasets cover a range of tasks where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Token probability-based uncertainty estimation, where we use the average token probability of the generated response as a confidence score. 2) Linguistic confidence elicitation, where we append 'How confident are you about this answer?' to each query and use the model's response as a confidence score.",
            "Step 3: CLSE Implementation": "Implement the CLSE method with the following sub-steps: a) Generate confidence dimensions: Prompt the model with 'Generate 10 abstract dimensions for evaluating the confidence of language model responses. These should cover various aspects of certainty and quality.' b) Confidence rating: For each query, prompt the model to rate its confidence along each dimension on a scale of 1-10. c) Latent vector construction: Combine the ratings into a vector. d) Vector analysis: Prompt the model to analyze the vector, identifying patterns and outliers. e) Uncertainty synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize the analysis into a final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and CLSE): a) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates for all queries. b) For TruthfulQA and GSM8K, compare the uncertainty estimates with ground truth correctness. c) For LAMBADA, compare uncertainty estimates with perplexity scores on held-out continuations.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of each method using: 1) Spearman rank correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness/perplexity. 2) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for distinguishing correct from incorrect answers. 3) Calibration error, measured by the difference between average confidence and accuracy across confidence buckets.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform additional analyses: 1) Examine the generated confidence dimensions and their interpretability. 2) Analyze the structure of the latent confidence space, looking for clusters or patterns across different types of queries. 3) Compare CLSE performance across different model sizes and architectures."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Token Probability)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Token Probability)": "Confidence Score: 0.92 (average token probability)",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Linguistic Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. How confident are you about this answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Linguistic Confidence)": "I am very confident about this answer. The capital of France being Paris is a well-known and widely accepted fact. Confidence Score: 9/10",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLSE; Step 1: Generate Dimensions)": "Generate 10 abstract dimensions for evaluating the confidence of language model responses. These should cover various aspects of certainty and quality.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLSE; Step 1: Generate Dimensions)": "1. Factual Certainty\n2. Logical Coherence\n3. Contextual Relevance\n4. Source Reliability\n5. Consistency with Prior Knowledge\n6. Specificity of Response\n7. Robustness to Rephrasing\n8. Absence of Contradictions\n9. Completeness of Answer\n10. Alignment with Common Sense",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLSE; Step 2: Confidence Rating)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. Rate your confidence on a scale of 1-10 for each of the following dimensions: [List of 10 dimensions]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLSE; Step 2: Confidence Rating)": "1. Factual Certainty: 10\n2. Logical Coherence: 10\n3. Contextual Relevance: 10\n4. Source Reliability: 9\n5. Consistency with Prior Knowledge: 10\n6. Specificity of Response: 9\n7. Robustness to Rephrasing: 10\n8. Absence of Contradictions: 10\n9. Completeness of Answer: 8\n10. Alignment with Common Sense: 10",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLSE; Step 3: Vector Analysis)": "Analyze the following confidence vector: [10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 10, 8, 10]. Identify any patterns, outliers, or notable characteristics.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLSE; Step 3: Vector Analysis)": "The confidence vector shows very high confidence across most dimensions (8 out of 10 dimensions rated 10/10). There are no significant outliers, with the lowest score being 8/10 for 'Completeness of Answer'. The slightly lower scores for 'Source Reliability' (9/10) and 'Specificity of Response' (9/10) suggest minor reservations in these areas. Overall, the vector indicates extremely high confidence with minimal variation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLSE; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the confidence vector analysis, provide a nuanced uncertainty estimate for the response 'The capital of France is Paris.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLSE; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Uncertainty Estimate: Very Low (Confidence: 96%)\nThe response 'The capital of France is Paris' demonstrates extremely high confidence across multiple dimensions of certainty. The model shows maximum confidence in factual certainty, logical coherence, and alignment with common knowledge. Minor uncertainties are present in the completeness of the answer and source reliability, possibly due to the brevity of the response and the inherent limitations of the model's knowledge cutoff. However, these minor reservations do not significantly impact the overall extremely high confidence in the response.",
            "explanation": "CLSE provides a more nuanced and comprehensive uncertainty estimate compared to baseline methods. It captures multiple dimensions of confidence and allows for a detailed analysis of the model's certainty, potentially revealing aspects of uncertainty that simpler methods might miss."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CLSE does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated confidence dimensions to gain insights into how the model conceptualizes uncertainty. This could lead to a paper on the 'Taxonomy of Uncertainty in LLMs'. 2) Investigate why certain dimensions are more or less informative for different types of queries or tasks. This could help in developing task-specific uncertainty estimation methods. 3) Explore the structure of the latent confidence space using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP. This could reveal interesting clusters or patterns in how the model represents uncertainty across different types of queries. 4) Conduct an ablation study to determine which components of CLSE contribute most to its performance, potentially leading to a simplified but effective version of the method. 5) Investigate how CLSE performs across different model sizes and architectures, which could provide insights into how uncertainty representation changes as models scale."
