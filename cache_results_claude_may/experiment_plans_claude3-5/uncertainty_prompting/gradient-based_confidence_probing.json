        "Problem": "Current methods for confidence estimation in language models often rely on output probabilities or ensemble disagreement, which may not capture the model's internal uncertainty accurately.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use token probabilities or model ensembles to estimate confidence, which can be computationally expensive or fail to capture deeper uncertainties.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging the model's internal gradients, we can potentially obtain a more nuanced view of its confidence across different parts of the input and output.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Gradient-Based Confidence Probing (GCP), a novel prompting technique that uses gradient information to estimate model confidence. The method involves: 1) Generating an initial response to a given query. 2) Computing gradients of the output with respect to the input embeddings. 3) Identifying high-gradient regions in both input and output as potential sources of uncertainty. 4) Constructing a follow-up prompt that targets these high-uncertainty regions, asking the model to elaborate on or refine its response in these areas. For example: 'You seem uncertain about [high-gradient phrase]. Can you explain your reasoning and provide a confidence level for this part of your response?'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate GCP against baseline methods on tasks such as open-ended question answering, summarization, and translation. Measure performance using calibration metrics, correlation with human judgments of uncertainty, and the quality of refined responses."

        "Title": "Gradient-Based Confidence Probing: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for confidence estimation in language models often rely on output probabilities or ensemble disagreement, which may not capture the model's internal uncertainty accurately. This project aims to develop a novel prompting technique that leverages gradient information to better quantify uncertainty and calibrate confidence in large language models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use token probabilities or model ensembles to estimate confidence, which can be computationally expensive or fail to capture deeper uncertainties. By leveraging the model's internal gradients, we can potentially obtain a more nuanced view of its confidence across different parts of the input and output. This approach is inspired by the idea that areas of high gradient magnitude may indicate regions where the model is more sensitive or uncertain.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Gradient-Based Confidence Probing (GCP), a novel prompting technique that uses gradient information to estimate model confidence. The method involves: 1) Generating an initial response to a given query. 2) Computing gradients of the output with respect to the input embeddings. 3) Identifying high-gradient regions in both input and output as potential sources of uncertainty. 4) Constructing a follow-up prompt that targets these high-uncertainty regions, asking the model to elaborate on or refine its response in these areas.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that cover a range of tasks: 1) Open-ended question answering (e.g., TruthfulQA), 2) Summarization (e.g., CNN/DailyMail), and 3) Translation (e.g., WMT14 English-French).",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. For gradient computation, use an open-source model like GPT-2 or BERT.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting, 2) Temperature scaling, 3) Ensemble disagreement (using different seeds or model versions).",
            "Step 4: GCP Implementation": "Implement the GCP method: a) Generate initial response, b) Compute gradients, c) Identify high-gradient regions, d) Construct and apply follow-up prompts.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration error, 2) Brier score, 3) Correlation with human judgments of uncertainty (collect a small set of human annotations), 4) Quality of refined responses (use GPT-4 as a judge).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and GCP. For each query: 1) Get baseline responses and confidence estimates, 2) Apply GCP to get refined responses and confidence estimates, 3) Compute all evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze results: 1) Compare GCP performance against baselines across all metrics, 2) Examine patterns in high-gradient regions, 3) Analyze how often and in what ways GCP leads to meaningful refinements in responses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
                "Output (Temperature Scaling, T=0.7)": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "Explanation": "Baseline methods provide a single confidence score or no explicit confidence, potentially missing nuanced uncertainties."
            },
            "GCP Example": {
                "Input": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
                "Initial Output": "The main causes of climate change are greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and industrial processes.",
                "Gradient Analysis": "High gradient detected for 'industrial processes'",
                "Follow-up Prompt": "You seem uncertain about 'industrial processes' as a cause of climate change. Can you explain your reasoning and provide a confidence level for this part of your response?",
                "Refined Output": "I apologize for any confusion. Let me clarify and provide more accurate information with confidence levels:\n\n1. Greenhouse gas emissions (Confidence: 95%): This is the primary driver of climate change, mainly from burning fossil fuels.\n\n2. Deforestation (Confidence: 90%): This reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb CO2 and releases stored carbon.\n\n3. Industrial processes (Confidence: 75%): While some industrial processes contribute to climate change, it's more accurate to say that industrial emissions, which are a subset of greenhouse gas emissions, are a major cause. The industrial processes themselves are not always direct causes.\n\nI'm less certain about industrial processes as a separate category because it overlaps with greenhouse gas emissions and its direct impact varies by industry and process.",
                "Explanation": "GCP identifies the uncertain part of the response and prompts for clarification, resulting in a more nuanced and calibrated answer with specific confidence levels for each point."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If GCP doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of where and why GCP fails, which could provide insights into model behavior under uncertainty. 2) Explore combining GCP with other methods like ensemble techniques or calibration methods to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 3) Investigate whether GCP is more effective for certain types of tasks or queries, which could lead to a targeted application of the method. 4) Analyze the relationship between gradient magnitudes and human-perceived uncertainty, which could provide valuable insights into model interpretability. 5) If the gradient-based approach proves challenging with black-box models, we could explore alternative methods of identifying uncertain regions in the text, such as using the model's own assessment of uncertainty through carefully designed prompts."
