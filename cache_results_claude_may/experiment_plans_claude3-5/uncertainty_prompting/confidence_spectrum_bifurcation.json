    "idea_name": "Confidence Spectrum Bifurcation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to provide fine-grained uncertainty estimates, often defaulting to binary confidence levels or broad categories.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use direct prompting for confidence scores or calibration through supervised fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of bifurcation in dynamical systems, we propose that iteratively splitting confidence intervals can lead to more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Bifurcation (CSB), a multi-step prompting method. First, we prompt the LLM to categorize its confidence as either above or below 50%. Then, we recursively prompt it to further bifurcate this interval (e.g., 25-50% or 50-75%), repeating until a desired granularity is reached. At each step, we ask the model to justify its choice, encouraging metacognitive reasoning. Finally, we aggregate these nested intervals and justifications to produce a detailed confidence spectrum and rationale.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CSB against standard confidence prompting and calibrated fine-tuning on diverse tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Evaluate using metrics like Brier score, calibration error, and correlation between confidence and correctness."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Bifurcation: A Novel Prompting Method for Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to provide fine-grained uncertainty estimates, often defaulting to binary confidence levels or broad categories. This limitation hinders their reliability and interpretability in critical applications where nuanced uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use direct prompting for confidence scores or calibration through supervised fine-tuning, which may not capture the full spectrum of uncertainty. Inspired by the concept of bifurcation in dynamical systems, we propose that iteratively splitting confidence intervals can lead to more nuanced uncertainty quantification. This method leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to produce a detailed confidence spectrum without requiring additional training or external calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Bifurcation (CSB), a multi-step prompting method. The process involves: 1) Prompting the LLM to categorize its confidence as either above or below 50%. 2) Recursively prompting it to further bifurcate this interval (e.g., 25-50% or 50-75%), repeating until a desired granularity is reached. 3) At each step, asking the model to justify its choice, encouraging metacognitive reasoning. 4) Aggregating these nested intervals and justifications to produce a detailed confidence spectrum and rationale.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering factual QA (e.g., TriviaQA), commonsense reasoning (e.g., COPA), and mathematical problem-solving (e.g., GSM8K). Ensure a mix of questions with varying difficulty levels to test the full range of confidence spectrum.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard confidence prompting: directly ask the model to provide a confidence score. 2) Calibrated fine-tuning: if an open-source model is available, fine-tune it on a small calibration dataset.",
            "Step 3: CSB Implementation": "Implement the CSB method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial bifurcation prompt: 'Is your confidence in this answer above or below 50%? Explain your reasoning.' b) Recursive bifurcation prompt: 'Within the [X-Y%] range, is your confidence in the upper or lower half? Explain your reasoning.' c) Set a maximum depth (e.g., 4 levels) or minimum interval size (e.g., 6.25%) as the stopping criterion.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API as the primary models. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic and Gemini from Google.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run the CSB method. c) For each question, record the model's answer, the final confidence spectrum, and the reasoning at each bifurcation step.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate using the following metrics: a) Brier score to measure calibration. b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE). c) Correlation between confidence and correctness. d) Qualitative analysis of reasoning chains.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare CSB against baselines across different task types and difficulty levels. Analyze how the granularity of confidence estimates affects performance metrics. Examine the quality and consistency of reasoning provided at each bifurcation step."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris. How confident are you in this answer on a scale from 0 to 100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence Prompting)": "I am 95% confident that Paris is the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSB; Step 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris. Is your confidence in this answer above or below 50%? Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSB; Step 1)": "My confidence is above 50%. This is a well-known fact that Paris is the capital of France. It's one of the most famous cities in the world and has been the capital of France for centuries.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSB; Step 2)": "Within the 50-100% range, is your confidence in the upper or lower half? Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSB; Step 2)": "My confidence is in the upper half (75-100%). Paris being the capital of France is a fundamental geographical fact taught in schools worldwide. It's consistently represented as the capital in all official documents, maps, and international relations.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSB; Step 3)": "Within the 75-100% range, is your confidence in the upper or lower half? Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSB; Step 3)": "My confidence is in the upper half (87.5-100%). The fact that Paris is the capital of France is so well-established that it would be extremely surprising if it were not true. It's a cornerstone of French identity and global knowledge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSB; Step 4)": "Within the 87.5-100% range, is your confidence in the upper or lower half? Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSB; Step 4)": "My confidence is in the upper half (93.75-100%). While it's theoretically possible for capitals to change, Paris has been the capital of France for so long and is so integral to French history and culture that my confidence in this fact is extremely high, bordering on certainty.",
            "explanation": "The CSB method provides a more nuanced confidence estimate (93.75-100%) compared to the baseline (95%), along with detailed reasoning at each step. This allows for finer-grained uncertainty quantification and provides insight into the model's thought process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSB doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why fine-grained confidence estimation is challenging for LLMs. We could investigate patterns in bifurcation decisions, analyze how different types of questions affect confidence estimation, or explore how the model's explanations change at different confidence levels. Additionally, we could experiment with variations of the CSB method, such as using different initial intervals or incorporating external knowledge to guide the bifurcation process. Another direction could be to use the collected data to train a meta-model that predicts LLM confidence based on response patterns, potentially offering insights into LLM behavior and decision-making processes."
