    "idea_name": "Confidence Calibration via Divergent Reasoning",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their outputs, especially when dealing with ambiguous or out-of-distribution queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mostly rely on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often assess their confidence by considering multiple perspectives and potential counterarguments. By simulating this process, we can potentially achieve better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Reasoning Prompting (DRP), a multi-step prompting technique that generates multiple reasoning paths for a given query. The process involves: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Generating alternative perspectives or potential flaws in the initial reasoning, 3) Synthesizing these divergent viewpoints, and 4) Producing a final confidence-calibrated response. Each step uses carefully crafted prompts to guide the model's reasoning process. The confidence estimate is derived from the degree of agreement between different reasoning paths and the strength of counterarguments.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare DRP against standard confidence elicitation techniques on diverse tasks including open-ended QA, commonsense reasoning, and specialized domain questions. Evaluate using calibration metrics like ECE (Expected Calibration Error) and MCE (Maximum Calibration Error)."

        "Title": "Divergent Reasoning Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their outputs, especially when dealing with ambiguous or out-of-distribution queries. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making and misinformation propagation when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence calibration in LLMs mostly rely on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration techniques. However, these methods often fail to capture the nuanced reasoning process that humans use when assessing their own confidence. Humans typically consider multiple perspectives and potential counterarguments before arriving at a confidence estimate. By simulating this process in LLMs, we can potentially achieve better-calibrated confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Reasoning Prompting (DRP), a multi-step prompting technique that generates multiple reasoning paths for a given query. The process involves four key steps: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Generating alternative perspectives or potential flaws in the initial reasoning, 3) Synthesizing these divergent viewpoints, and 4) Producing a final confidence-calibrated response. Each step uses carefully crafted prompts to guide the model's reasoning process. The confidence estimate is derived from the degree of agreement between different reasoning paths and the strength of counterarguments.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, 2) SWAG for commonsense reasoning, and 3) MedQA for specialized domain questions. These datasets cover a range of task types and difficulty levels, allowing us to assess the generalizability of our approach.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each query. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings (0.5, 0.7, 1.0) during generation and calibrate the output probabilities post-hoc.",
            "Step 3: DRP Implementation": "Implement the four-step DRP process: a) Initial response: 'Please provide an initial answer to the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Alternative perspectives: 'Now, generate two alternative perspectives or potential flaws in your initial reasoning:' c) Synthesis: 'Considering your initial answer and the alternative perspectives, provide a synthesis of these viewpoints:' d) Final response: 'Based on your synthesis, provide a final answer to the question along with a confidence estimate (0-100%):' ",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. This allows us to compare the effectiveness of DRP across different model sizes and capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and model combination, we will evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), 3) Brier Score, and 4) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy for SWAG, F1 score for TruthfulQA). We will also compute the average confidence and compare it to the actual performance to assess overconfidence or underconfidence.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of DRP against baselines across different datasets and models, 2) Examination of cases where DRP significantly improves or degrades performance, 3) Analysis of the generated alternative perspectives and their impact on final confidence estimates, 4) Investigation of the relationship between task difficulty and the effectiveness of DRP."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in my answer.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly elicits confidence, but the model expresses overconfidence even for a simple factual question."
            },
            "DRP Example": {
                "Input 1": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output 1": "The capital of France is Paris.",
                "Input 2": "Now, generate two alternative perspectives or potential flaws in your initial reasoning:",
                "Output 2": "1. While Paris is widely recognized as the capital of France, some might argue that the actual seat of government is split between Paris and Versailles, as the French Parliament meets in Versailles for certain sessions.\n2. Historically, there have been periods when other cities served as the capital of France, such as Vichy during World War II. This could potentially cause confusion about the current capital.",
                "Input 3": "Considering your initial answer and the alternative perspectives, provide a synthesis of these viewpoints:",
                "Output 3": "While Paris is indeed the official and widely recognized capital of France, it's worth noting that the concept of a capital city can have some nuances. The French government does operate primarily from Paris, but Versailles plays a role in certain governmental functions. Additionally, historical changes in the capital during specific periods add a layer of complexity to the question. However, in modern times and for all practical purposes, Paris is unequivocally considered the capital of France.",
                "Input 4": "Based on your synthesis, provide a final answer to the question along with a confidence estimate (0-100%):",
                "Output 4": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98%. While there are some historical and functional nuances to consider, Paris is the official and internationally recognized capital of France in the present day.",
                "Explanation": "DRP encourages the model to consider alternative perspectives and potential sources of uncertainty, leading to a more nuanced and slightly less confident response compared to the baseline."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DRP method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated alternative perspectives to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could involve categorizing the types of alternatives generated and their relevance to the task at hand. Second, we could experiment with variations of the DRP process, such as increasing the number of alternative perspectives or adding a step where the model explicitly argues against its own initial reasoning. Third, we could investigate how DRP affects different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. opinion-based) and use these insights to develop a hybrid approach that applies different prompting strategies based on question type. Lastly, we could explore combining DRP with post-hoc calibration techniques to see if this combination yields better results than either method alone. These analyses and variations could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of using LLMs for self-calibration, potentially leading to a more nuanced understanding of model uncertainty in different contexts."
