        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas where they lack expertise or when faced with ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or uncertainty sampling techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring counterfactual scenarios, we can probe the model's understanding of its own knowledge boundaries and potential failure modes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Uncertainty Prompting (CUP), a method that generates and explores counterfactual scenarios to assess model uncertainty. The prompt guides the LLM to: (1) Generate multiple counterfactual versions of the input query by altering key elements. (2) Provide responses to these counterfactuals. (3) Analyze how these alterations affect the confidence and content of the responses. (4) Synthesize this information to estimate uncertainty for the original query. This process helps the model reason about its own knowledge limitations and potential sources of error.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CUP on tasks prone to overconfidence, such as out-of-distribution question answering and ambiguous queries. We'll compare against standard confidence estimation methods, focusing on metrics like calibration error and the ability to identify unanswerable or ambiguous queries. We'll also conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated counterfactuals and their impact on uncertainty estimation."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Uncertainty Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas where they lack expertise or when faced with ambiguous queries. This overconfidence can result in the propagation of misinformation and unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on direct confidence estimation or uncertainty sampling techniques. However, these methods often struggle to capture the nuanced boundaries of model knowledge, especially in complex or ambiguous scenarios. By exploring counterfactual scenarios, we can probe the model's understanding of its own knowledge boundaries and potential failure modes. This approach leverages the model's reasoning capabilities to perform a more thorough self-assessment, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Uncertainty Prompting (CUP), a method that generates and explores counterfactual scenarios to assess model uncertainty. The process involves four main steps: 1) Generate multiple counterfactual versions of the input query by altering key elements. 2) Provide responses to these counterfactuals. 3) Analyze how these alterations affect the confidence and content of the responses. 4) Synthesize this information to estimate uncertainty for the original query. This process helps the model reason about its own knowledge limitations and potential sources of error.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that are prone to overconfidence issues: 1) TruthfulQA for out-of-distribution question answering, 2) AmbigQA for ambiguous queries, and 3) a subset of the MMLU dataset for domain-specific knowledge assessment.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: prompt the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CUP Implementation": "Implement the CUP method with the following sub-steps: a) Counterfactual Generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 counterfactual versions of the input query. b) Counterfactual Response Generation: For each counterfactual, generate a response and confidence score. c) Analysis: Prompt the model to analyze how the counterfactuals affect its responses and confidence. d) Uncertainty Estimation: Based on the analysis, prompt the model to provide a final uncertainty estimate for the original query.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CUP against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration Error: measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. 2) Brier Score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) AUROC for identifying unanswerable or ambiguous queries.",
            "Step 5: Qualitative Analysis": "Perform a qualitative analysis of the generated counterfactuals and their impact on uncertainty estimation. Categorize the types of counterfactuals that lead to the most significant changes in confidence.",
            "Step 6: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 7: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the CUP method. For counterfactual generation: 'Generate 3-5 variations of the following question by changing key elements while maintaining the core intent: [QUESTION]'. For analysis: 'Analyze how the following counterfactual questions affect your confidence and response compared to the original question: [COUNTERFACTUALS]'. For final uncertainty estimation: 'Based on your analysis of the counterfactuals, provide an uncertainty estimate for your answer to the original question: [QUESTION]'.",
            "Step 8: Experiment Execution": "Run the experiments on each dataset using both the baseline methods and CUP. Ensure to use a sufficient number of samples (at least 1000 per dataset) to get statistically significant results.",
            "Step 9: Result Analysis": "Compare the performance of CUP against the baselines across all metrics. Analyze how CUP performs differently across various types of questions (e.g., factual, ambiguous, out-of-distribution).",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of CUP, such as the number of counterfactuals generated or the depth of analysis prompted."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on Mars? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: As of now, no human has ever walked on Mars. Confidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP; Step 1: Counterfactual Generation)": "Generate 3-5 variations of the following question by changing key elements while maintaining the core intent: Who was the first person to walk on Mars?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUP; Step 1: Counterfactual Generation)": "1. Who was the first person to walk on the Moon?\n2. Who is expected to be the first person to walk on Mars?\n3. What was the first robotic mission to successfully land on Mars?\n4. Who was the first person to orbit Mars?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP; Step 2: Counterfactual Response Generation)": "Please answer each of the following questions and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each answer:\n1. Who was the first person to walk on Mars?\n2. Who was the first person to walk on the Moon?\n3. Who is expected to be the first person to walk on Mars?\n4. What was the first robotic mission to successfully land on Mars?\n5. Who was the first person to orbit Mars?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUP; Step 2: Counterfactual Response Generation)": "1. No one has walked on Mars yet. Confidence: 0.99\n2. Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the Moon. Confidence: 0.99\n3. It's uncertain, but likely to be an astronaut from NASA, SpaceX, or another space agency. Confidence: 0.7\n4. The first successful Mars landing was by NASA's Viking 1 lander in 1976. Confidence: 0.95\n5. No one has orbited Mars yet. The first crewed mission to orbit Mars is still in the planning stages. Confidence: 0.9",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP; Step 3: Analysis)": "Analyze how the following counterfactual questions affect your confidence and response compared to the original question 'Who was the first person to walk on Mars?':\n1. Who was the first person to walk on the Moon?\n2. Who is expected to be the first person to walk on Mars?\n3. What was the first robotic mission to successfully land on Mars?\n4. Who was the first person to orbit Mars?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUP; Step 3: Analysis)": "The counterfactual questions reveal important distinctions:\n1. Moon vs. Mars: I'm highly confident about Moon landings (Neil Armstrong), which contrasts with the lack of Mars landings, reinforcing my certainty that no one has walked on Mars yet.\n2. Future Mars missions: This question highlights the uncertainty around future Mars missions, reducing confidence in any specific prediction.\n3. Robotic Mars missions: I'm confident about robotic Mars landings, which further supports that no human has walked on Mars.\n4. Mars orbit: This question revealed a gap in my knowledge about crewed Mars orbits, slightly reducing overall confidence.\n\nThese counterfactuals help clarify the boundaries of my knowledge about Mars exploration, increasing confidence in the fact that no human has walked on Mars, but revealing uncertainties about future Mars missions and some aspects of Mars exploration history.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP; Step 4: Uncertainty Estimation)": "Based on your analysis of the counterfactuals, provide an uncertainty estimate for your answer to the original question: Who was the first person to walk on Mars?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUP; Step 4: Uncertainty Estimation)": "Uncertainty estimate: 0.02 (or 2% uncertainty)\n\nExplanation: The analysis of counterfactuals has reinforced my confidence that no human has walked on Mars yet. The high certainty about Moon landings and robotic Mars missions contrasts sharply with the lack of human Mars landings. However, the small uncertainty accounts for potential gaps in my knowledge about very recent space exploration events or any misunderstanding about the current state of Mars missions.",
            "explanation": "CUP improves upon direct confidence estimation by exploring related scenarios, which helps the model reason about its knowledge boundaries. This process reveals nuances that might be missed in a simple confidence score, leading to a more calibrated uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CUP doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine the types of counterfactuals generated and their relevance to uncertainty estimation. This might reveal limitations in the model's ability to generate meaningful counterfactuals or to reason about them effectively. We could also investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from CUP than others, potentially leading to insights about when and how to apply counterfactual reasoning for uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we could explore combining CUP with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration via post-processing, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could analyze the model's reasoning process during the CUP steps to gain insights into how LLMs approach metacognition and self-assessment, which could inform future research on improving model introspection and uncertainty awareness."
