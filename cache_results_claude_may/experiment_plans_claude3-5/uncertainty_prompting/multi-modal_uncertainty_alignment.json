        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with information from multiple modalities, leading to potential misalignments in confidence across different types of inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods focus on single-modality inputs or treat multi-modal inputs as simple concatenations without explicitly addressing cross-modal uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to explicitly consider and align uncertainties across different modalities, we can achieve more holistic and accurate confidence estimates in multi-modal tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Modal Uncertainty Alignment (MMUA), a prompting technique designed to harmonize confidence estimates across different input modalities. The process involves: (1) Separate confidence estimations for each modality, (2) Cross-modal corroboration, where the model is prompted to identify how each modality supports or contradicts the others, (3) Uncertainty reconciliation, where the model explains and resolves any discrepancies in confidence across modalities, (4) Holistic re-evaluation, where the model provides a final confidence estimate that accounts for all modalities and their interactions. This method encourages the model to consider how different types of information contribute to overall certainty or uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MMUA on multi-modal tasks such as visual question answering, audio-visual scene understanding, and text-image alignment problems. Compare against unimodal confidence estimation and naive multi-modal concatenation approaches. Use metrics such as multi-modal calibration error and expert evaluations of cross-modal uncertainty awareness."

        "Title": "Multi-Modal Uncertainty Alignment: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with information from multiple modalities, leading to potential misalignments in confidence across different types of inputs. This can result in overconfident or underconfident predictions in multi-modal tasks, potentially leading to unreliable decision-making in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on single-modality inputs or treat multi-modal inputs as simple concatenations without explicitly addressing cross-modal uncertainty. By prompting LLMs to explicitly consider and align uncertainties across different modalities, we can achieve more holistic and accurate confidence estimates in multi-modal tasks. This approach leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to perform a more nuanced analysis of uncertainty across modalities, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates without the need for extensive model modifications or additional training data.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Modal Uncertainty Alignment (MMUA), a prompting technique designed to harmonize confidence estimates across different input modalities. The process involves four main steps: (1) Separate confidence estimations for each modality, where the model is prompted to provide confidence scores for each input modality independently. (2) Cross-modal corroboration, where the model is prompted to identify how each modality supports or contradicts the others. (3) Uncertainty reconciliation, where the model explains and resolves any discrepancies in confidence across modalities. (4) Holistic re-evaluation, where the model provides a final confidence estimate that accounts for all modalities and their interactions. This method encourages the model to consider how different types of information contribute to overall certainty or uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three multi-modal datasets: (1) VQA-v2 for visual question answering, (2) AudioCaps for audio-visual scene understanding, and (3) MSCOCO for text-image alignment. For each dataset, we will create a test set of 1000 examples.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Unimodal confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide a confidence score for each modality separately and use the average as the final score. (2) Naive multi-modal concatenation: Concatenate all modalities and prompt the model to provide a single confidence score.",
            "Step 3: MMUA Implementation": "Implement the MMUA method with the following steps: (1) Separate confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide confidence scores for each modality. (2) Cross-modal corroboration: Prompt the model to identify support or contradictions between modalities. (3) Uncertainty reconciliation: Prompt the model to explain and resolve discrepancies. (4) Holistic re-evaluation: Prompt the model to provide a final confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from OpenAI API for our experiments, as it has demonstrated strong multi-modal capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and MMUA), run the model on the test set and collect predictions and confidence estimates.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Multi-modal calibration error (MCE): Extend the traditional calibration error to account for multiple modalities. (2) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. (3) AUC-ROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect predictions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of MMUA against the baselines. Analyze cases where MMUA significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines. Examine the model's reasoning process in the cross-modal corroboration and uncertainty reconciliation steps."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Image: [A man riding a bicycle on a city street]\nText: What is the man doing?\nAudio: [Sound of traffic and bicycle bell]",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Based on the image, text, and audio provided, answer the question and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer.",
                "Baseline Output": "Answer: The man is riding a bicycle.\nConfidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score without explicitly considering the contribution of each modality or potential conflicts between them."
            },
            "MMUA Example": {
                "Input": "Image: [A man riding a bicycle on a city street]\nText: What is the man doing?\nAudio: [Sound of traffic and bicycle bell]",
                "MMUA Step 1 Prompt": "Provide separate confidence scores (0-1) for each modality in answering the question 'What is the man doing?'",
                "MMUA Step 1 Output": "Image confidence: 0.9 (Clear image of a man on a bicycle)\nText confidence: 0.5 (Question alone doesn't provide information)\nAudio confidence: 0.7 (Traffic sounds and bicycle bell support the bicycle scenario)",
                "MMUA Step 2 Prompt": "Identify how each modality supports or contradicts the others in answering the question.",
                "MMUA Step 2 Output": "The image strongly supports the answer 'riding a bicycle'. The audio (traffic sounds and bicycle bell) corroborates this. The text (question) doesn't provide additional information but doesn't contradict the other modalities.",
                "MMUA Step 3 Prompt": "Explain and resolve any discrepancies in confidence across modalities.",
                "MMUA Step 3 Output": "The main discrepancy is the lower confidence in the text modality. This is because the question itself doesn't provide information about the action. However, this lower confidence doesn't contradict the high confidence from the image and audio. The image provides the strongest evidence, supported by the audio cues.",
                "MMUA Step 4 Prompt": "Provide a final confidence estimate that accounts for all modalities and their interactions.",
                "MMUA Step 4 Output": "Final answer: The man is riding a bicycle.\nFinal confidence: 0.85\nExplanation: The high confidence from the image (0.9) is slightly moderated by the supporting but less certain audio evidence (0.7). The neutral text doesn't affect the confidence significantly. The overall confidence is high due to the strong visual evidence and corroborating audio cues.",
                "Explanation": "MMUA provides a more nuanced confidence estimate by explicitly considering each modality, their interactions, and resolving discrepancies. This leads to a slightly lower but potentially more accurate confidence score compared to the baseline."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MMUA method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the model's reasoning process during the cross-modal corroboration and uncertainty reconciliation steps. This could provide insights into how LLMs handle multi-modal information and where they struggle in aligning uncertainties. Second, we could experiment with different prompting strategies for each step of MMUA, such as using more structured prompts or providing examples of good uncertainty alignment. Third, we could investigate how the performance of MMUA varies across different types of multi-modal tasks and modality combinations, which could lead to a taxonomy of multi-modal uncertainty challenges. Finally, we could compare MMUA's performance across different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, Claude, PaLM) to understand how model architecture and training affect multi-modal uncertainty alignment capabilities. These alternative directions could turn the project into an insightful analysis of LLMs' multi-modal reasoning abilities, even if the original method doesn't yield the expected improvements."
