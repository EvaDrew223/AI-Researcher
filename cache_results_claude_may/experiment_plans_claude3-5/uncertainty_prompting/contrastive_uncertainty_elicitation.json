    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, particularly in cases where they lack relevant knowledge or encounter ambiguous inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct querying of model confidence or analysis of output probabilities, which can be unreliable or unavailable in some models.",
        "Motivation": "By presenting contrasting scenarios or alternative formulations of a query, we can probe the model's consistency and use discrepancies as indicators of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation (CUE), a prompting technique that generates multiple contrastive versions of an input query to gauge model uncertainty. CUE operates in three phases: 1) Query Transformation, where we automatically generate semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse versions of the original query. 2) Contrastive Response Generation, where the model provides answers to all query versions. 3) Consistency Analysis, where we compare the responses across query versions to quantify uncertainty. Inconsistencies in responses or reasoning paths are used to compute an uncertainty score. Additionally, we prompt the model to explain discrepancies between its own responses, further refining the uncertainty estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CUE on a range of tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and open-ended generation. Compare against baseline methods in terms of uncertainty calibration (using metrics like ECE) and correlation with human judgments of model uncertainty. Analyze how CUE performs across different model sizes and architectures."

        "Title": "Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, particularly in cases where they lack relevant knowledge or encounter ambiguous inputs. This can lead to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution or challenging queries, potentially resulting in misinformation or unreliable decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in language models typically rely on direct querying of model confidence or analysis of output probabilities, which can be unreliable or unavailable in some models. By presenting contrasting scenarios or alternative formulations of a query, we can probe the model's consistency and use discrepancies as indicators of uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to gauge its uncertainty, potentially providing a more robust and generalizable method for uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Uncertainty Elicitation (CUE), a prompting technique that generates multiple contrastive versions of an input query to gauge model uncertainty. CUE operates in three phases: 1) Query Transformation: We automatically generate semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse versions of the original query. 2) Contrastive Response Generation: The model provides answers to all query versions. 3) Consistency Analysis: We compare the responses across query versions to quantify uncertainty. Inconsistencies in responses or reasoning paths are used to compute an uncertainty score. Additionally, we prompt the model to explain discrepancies between its own responses, further refining the uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate CUE: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and 3) WinoGrande for challenging language understanding tasks. These datasets cover a range of task types and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Query Transformation": "For each question in the datasets, generate 3-5 semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse versions using GPT-4. Prompt: 'Rephrase the following question in 3-5 different ways, maintaining the same meaning but varying the syntax and vocabulary: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION]'",
            "Step 3: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence querying: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Output probability analysis: Use the model's output logits to compute the entropy of the answer distribution as a measure of uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: CUE Implementation": "For each original question and its transformed versions: a) Generate answers using GPT-4. b) Compute consistency scores between answers (e.g., using semantic similarity measures like cosine similarity of sentence embeddings). c) Prompt the model to explain discrepancies: 'You gave different answers to these similar questions: [SHOW_ANSWERS]. Explain why there are differences and assess your confidence in the correct answer.'",
            "Step 5: Uncertainty Score Computation": "Develop an uncertainty score based on: a) Consistency between answers to transformed queries. b) Model's self-assessment of discrepancies. c) Semantic distance between the original and transformed queries (to account for potential meaning shifts during transformation).",
            "Step 6: Model Evaluation": "Evaluate GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Claude 2 using both baseline methods and CUE on all three datasets. For each dataset, use appropriate task-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy for TruthfulQA and CommonsenseQA, F1 score for WinoGrande) as well as uncertainty calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE).",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (50-100 samples per dataset) to assess the correlation between CUE uncertainty scores and human judgments of model uncertainty. Use crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk for this step.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare CUE against baselines in terms of: a) Correlation with human judgments of uncertainty. b) Calibration of uncertainty estimates (using ECE). c) Ability to identify out-of-distribution or challenging inputs. d) Consistency across different model sizes and architectures."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for confidence, but the model may be overconfident, especially for well-known facts."
            },
            "CUE Method Example": {
                "Input": "Original Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nTransformed Q1: Which individual first set foot on the lunar surface?\nTransformed Q2: In the history of lunar exploration, who made the inaugural step onto the moon's terrain?\nTransformed Q3: Name the astronaut who initially stepped onto the moon during humanity's first lunar landing.",
                "Output": "Original A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nA1: Neil Armstrong was the first individual to set foot on the lunar surface.\nA2: Neil Armstrong made the inaugural step onto the moon's terrain during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.\nA3: The astronaut who initially stepped onto the moon during humanity's first lunar landing was Neil Armstrong.\n\nExplanation of discrepancies: There are no significant discrepancies between these answers. All responses consistently identify Neil Armstrong as the first person to walk on the moon. The slight variations in wording are due to the different phrasings of the questions, but the core information remains the same. Given the consistency across all answers and the well-documented historical fact, I have high confidence in the correctness of this answer.",
                "Explanation": "CUE generates multiple versions of the question, allowing for consistency checking. In this case, the answers are highly consistent, indicating low uncertainty. The model's self-assessment confirms this low uncertainty."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CUE does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why CUE fails, potentially revealing insights about model behavior under different types of uncertainty. This could lead to a paper focused on analyzing patterns of model inconsistency across different query formulations. Second, we could explore combining CUE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or dropout-based approaches, to create a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches. Finally, if the transformation step introduces too much noise, we could refocus the project on developing better methods for generating semantically equivalent queries, potentially leading to a separate contribution in the field of paraphrase generation for robust model evaluation."
