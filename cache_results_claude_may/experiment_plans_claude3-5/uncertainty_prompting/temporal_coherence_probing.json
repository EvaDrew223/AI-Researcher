    "idea_name": "Temporal Coherence Probing",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often produce inconsistent levels of confidence when queried multiple times or when the context changes slightly, indicating poor calibration.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing calibration methods focus on single-query scenarios and don't account for temporal consistency in confidence estimates.",
        "Motivation": "By probing the model's confidence across temporally varying contexts, we can uncover inconsistencies and improve the robustness of uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Probing (TCP), a prompting strategy that assesses the model's confidence across a series of temporally linked queries. TCP starts with an initial query and progressively constructs a sequence of follow-up prompts that alter the temporal context (e.g., changing tense, adding time-based qualifiers, or introducing hypothetical future scenarios). The model's confidence is tracked across this temporal sequence, and inconsistencies are identified. TCP then employs a meta-prompt that forces the model to reconcile these temporal inconsistencies, leading to a more coherent and well-calibrated final confidence estimate. This method not only improves calibration but also provides insights into the model's handling of temporal reasoning.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare TCP against standard single-query calibration methods on tasks involving temporal reasoning, such as event prediction or historical analysis. Evaluate using metrics for calibration quality and temporal consistency, as well as targeted probes for specific temporal reasoning capabilities."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Probing: Improving Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent levels of confidence when queried multiple times or when the context changes slightly, indicating poor calibration. This inconsistency is particularly problematic in temporal reasoning tasks, where the model's confidence should ideally remain stable across related temporal contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods primarily focus on single-query scenarios and fail to account for temporal consistency in confidence estimates. By probing the model's confidence across temporally varying contexts, we can uncover inconsistencies and improve the robustness of uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where confidence in knowledge typically remains stable across related temporal contexts unless new information is introduced.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Probing (TCP), a prompting strategy that assesses the model's confidence across a series of temporally linked queries. TCP consists of the following steps: 1) Initial query: Present the model with an initial question. 2) Temporal sequence generation: Construct a series of follow-up prompts that alter the temporal context (e.g., changing tense, adding time-based qualifiers, or introducing hypothetical future scenarios). 3) Confidence tracking: Record the model's confidence for each query in the temporal sequence. 4) Inconsistency identification: Analyze the confidence patterns to identify temporal inconsistencies. 5) Meta-prompt reconciliation: Use a meta-prompt to force the model to reconcile these temporal inconsistencies, leading to a more coherent and well-calibrated final confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for our experiments: 1) TimeQA: A dataset of time-sensitive questions. 2) Temporal-COPA: A dataset for temporal commonsense reasoning. 3) ForecastQA: A dataset for evaluating models on forecasting tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: 1) Standard single-query confidence estimation. 2) Temperature scaling. 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: TCP Implementation": "Implement the TCP method as follows: a) For each question in the dataset, generate a sequence of 5 temporally-related queries. b) Prompt the model with each query and record its confidence. c) Identify inconsistencies in the confidence estimates. d) Apply the meta-prompt for reconciliation. e) Record the final calibrated confidence.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE). 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). 3) Brier Score. 4) Temporal Consistency Score (TCS): A new metric we introduce to measure the stability of confidence estimates across temporal variations.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and record results. b) Run TCP method and record results. c) Compare performance using the defined metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare TCP against baselines on each metric. b) Analyze the impact of the number of temporal queries on performance. c) Investigate the effectiveness of the meta-prompt reconciliation step. d) Examine performance differences across different types of temporal variations (e.g., tense changes vs. hypothetical scenarios)."

            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who will be the President of the United States in 2024?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future with certainty. The President of the United States in 2024 will be determined by the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, which has not yet taken place. The election is scheduled for November 5, 2024, and the winner will take office on January 20, 2025. Currently, it's too early to know who the candidates will be or who will win the election.

(Confidence: 90%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP Step 2: Temporal Sequence)": "Q1: Who is the current President of the United States in 2023?\nQ2: Who was the President of the United States in 2020?\nQ3: Who will be the President of the United States in 2025?\nQ4: If the current trends continue, who is likely to be the President of the United States in 2024?\nQ5: In a hypothetical scenario where the 2024 election is canceled, who would be the President of the United States in 2024?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP Step 2: Temporal Sequence)": "A1: The current President of the United States in 2023 is Joe Biden. (Confidence: 100%)\nA2: The President of the United States in 2020 was Donald Trump. (Confidence: 100%)\nA3: The President of the United States in 2025 will be determined by the outcome of the 2024 election, which has not yet taken place. (Confidence: 95%)\nA4: It's not possible to predict with certainty who will be the President in 2024 based on current trends, as many factors can influence the election outcome. (Confidence: 70%)\nA5: In a hypothetical scenario where the 2024 election is canceled, the sitting president would likely remain in office, which would be Joe Biden. However, this scenario is highly unlikely and would be unprecedented in U.S. history. (Confidence: 80%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP Step 3: Meta-prompt Reconciliation)": "Given your responses to the temporal sequence of questions about the U.S. presidency, please provide a final, reconciled answer to the original question: Who will be the President of the United States in 2024? Ensure your confidence level is consistent with the information provided across all temporal contexts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP Step 3: Meta-prompt Reconciliation)": "Based on the temporal sequence of questions and answers, I can provide a more nuanced response to the original question about who will be the President of the United States in 2024:\n\nAs of now, it is not possible to definitively state who will be the President of the United States in 2024. The outcome will be determined by the presidential election scheduled for November 5, 2024. The current president, Joe Biden, may run for re-election, but this is not guaranteed. Other candidates from various political parties will likely participate in the election as well.\n\nWhile current trends and polls might suggest certain outcomes, it's important to note that political landscapes can change rapidly, and many factors can influence the election result. Historical precedent shows that incumbent presidents often run for re-election, but this is not always the case, and winning re-election is not guaranteed.\n\nGiven the information available across different temporal contexts, I can say with high confidence that a democratically elected individual will serve as President in 2024, barring any unprecedented events. However, I cannot predict with high confidence who that individual will be.\n\n(Confidence: 85%)\n\nThis confidence level reflects our certainty about the process of presidential succession and the scheduled election, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting future political outcomes.",
            "explanation": "The TCP method improves upon the baseline by considering multiple temporal contexts, which allows for a more nuanced and consistent confidence estimation. The final reconciled answer provides a more comprehensive view of the situation, accounting for various temporal aspects and potential scenarios, resulting in a more robust and well-calibrated confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCP method does not significantly improve calibration over baseline methods, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The nature of temporal inconsistencies in LLM outputs - are they systematic or random? 2) The effectiveness of different types of temporal queries in exposing model uncertainty. 3) The impact of prompt engineering on confidence estimation - how sensitive are confidence estimates to slight changes in prompt wording? 4) The relationship between model size and temporal consistency in confidence estimation. These analyses could provide valuable insights into the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs and inform future approaches to improving uncertainty calibration. Additionally, we could explore combining TCP with other calibration methods, such as ensemble techniques or post-hoc calibration, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results."
