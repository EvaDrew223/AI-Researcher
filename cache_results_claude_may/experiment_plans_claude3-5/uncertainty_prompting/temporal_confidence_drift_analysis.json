    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit inconsistent confidence levels across time when repeatedly prompted with the same or similar questions, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches primarily focus on single-shot confidence estimation or use simple averaging of multiple queries.",
        "Motivation": "By analyzing the temporal patterns in confidence drift, we can potentially uncover underlying uncertainties that are not apparent in single-shot estimations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel prompting method called Temporal Confidence Drift Analysis (TCDA). TCDA involves repeatedly prompting the model with the same question at varying time intervals, ranging from seconds to hours. The prompts are designed to elicit both the answer and a confidence score. We then apply time series analysis techniques to the sequence of confidence scores, including trend analysis, seasonality detection, and anomaly identification. The prompt structure includes a 'timestamp' to simulate temporal progression: 'At [timestamp], answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): [question]'. The analysis of the resulting time series provides insights into the model's underlying uncertainty, with stable confidence over time indicating higher certainty, while fluctuating or drifting confidence suggests underlying uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare TCDA with single-shot confidence estimation and simple averaging on various question-answering datasets. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error over time, consistency of confidence estimates, and correlation with answer correctness. Analyze how different temporal patterns in confidence relate to actual model performance and uncertainty."

        "Title": "Temporal Confidence Drift Analysis: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Time-Series Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit inconsistent confidence levels across time when repeatedly prompted with the same or similar questions, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. This inconsistency hinders the practical application of these models in scenarios requiring robust confidence calibration.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches primarily focus on single-shot confidence estimation or use simple averaging of multiple queries, which fail to capture the temporal dynamics of model uncertainty. By analyzing the temporal patterns in confidence drift, we can potentially uncover underlying uncertainties that are not apparent in single-shot estimations. This method could provide a more nuanced and reliable measure of model uncertainty, crucial for applications in critical decision-making processes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Confidence Drift Analysis (TCDA), a novel prompting method that involves repeatedly querying the model with the same question at varying time intervals. The process includes: 1) Designing prompts that elicit both the answer and a confidence score. 2) Implementing a time-stamped prompting strategy to simulate temporal progression. 3) Applying time series analysis techniques to the sequence of confidence scores, including trend analysis, seasonality detection, and anomaly identification. 4) Interpreting the resulting time series to gain insights into the model's underlying uncertainty, with stable confidence over time indicating higher certainty, while fluctuating or drifting confidence suggests underlying uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering different domains: 1) TriviaQA for general knowledge questions. 2) SQuAD for reading comprehension. 3) MMLU for specialized knowledge across various academic fields.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Design": "Create a prompt template: 'At [timestamp], answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): [question]'. Implement a function to generate timestamps at varying intervals (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day).",
            "Step 4: Data Collection": "For each question in the datasets: 1) Generate 50 timestamps spanning a simulated period of 7 days. 2) Query the model with the timestamped prompt for each timestamp. 3) Store the answer, confidence score, and timestamp for each query.",
            "Step 5: Time Series Analysis": "For each question: 1) Create a time series of confidence scores. 2) Perform trend analysis using moving averages and linear regression. 3) Detect seasonality using autocorrelation and spectral analysis. 4) Identify anomalies using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).",
            "Step 6: Uncertainty Quantification": "Develop metrics to quantify uncertainty based on the time series analysis: 1) Confidence Stability Score: measure of how stable the confidence is over time. 2) Drift Magnitude: the overall change in confidence from start to end. 3) Seasonality Strength: measure of how strongly seasonal patterns are present. 4) Anomaly Frequency: count of significant anomalies in confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Baseline Comparison": "Implement baseline methods: 1) Single-shot confidence estimation. 2) Simple averaging of multiple queries (5 queries per question). Compare TCDA results with these baselines.",
            "Step 8: Performance Evaluation": "Evaluate using metrics such as: 1) Calibration error over time. 2) Consistency of confidence estimates. 3) Correlation with answer correctness. 4) Ability to predict model failures based on uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 9: Analysis and Interpretation": "1) Analyze how different temporal patterns in confidence relate to actual model performance. 2) Investigate the relationship between uncertainty estimates and specific question types or domains. 3) Examine cases where TCDA significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-shot)": "Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-shot)": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCDA)": "At 2023-07-01 09:00:00, answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCDA)": "At 2023-07-01 09:00:00, the capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98%",
            "Explanation": "While both methods might provide high confidence for this simple question, TCDA allows for the analysis of confidence changes over time. For instance, we might observe that the model's confidence slightly fluctuates even for well-known facts, providing insights into its inherent uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCDA does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of temporal patterns in LLM responses. This could involve: 1) Investigating factors that contribute to confidence drift, such as prompt phrasing or context window limitations. 2) Analyzing how different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. opinion-based) exhibit different temporal confidence patterns. 3) Exploring the relationship between confidence drift and other aspects of model output, such as answer consistency or verbosity. 4) Developing a taxonomy of temporal confidence patterns and their potential implications for model reliability and decision-making in various applications. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of LLM behavior, even if the original uncertainty quantification goal is not fully achieved."
