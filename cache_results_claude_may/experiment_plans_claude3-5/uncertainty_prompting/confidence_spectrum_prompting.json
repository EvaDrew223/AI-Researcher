    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for eliciting confidence from LLMs often result in overconfident or poorly calibrated estimates, especially on out-of-distribution or challenging tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches include direct confidence prompting, ensemble methods, and calibration using held-out data.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often express uncertainty using a spectrum of qualitative phrases. By prompting LLMs to generate responses across a range of confidence levels, we can potentially obtain more nuanced and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Prompting (CSP), where we ask the LLM to generate multiple responses at different confidence levels, e.g., 'Give me an answer you're 99% sure about', '90% sure', '50% sure', etc. We then analyze the consistency and content of these responses to derive a final confidence estimate. The prompt includes instructions to consider different aspects of uncertainty (e.g., factual recall, reasoning steps) when generating each response. We also incorporate a meta-prompt asking the model to reflect on its confidence spectrum and provide a final calibrated estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CSP against direct confidence prompting and ensemble methods on diverse tasks including factual QA, reasoning problems, and out-of-distribution scenarios. Evaluate using calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error) and performance on selective prediction tasks."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for eliciting confidence from Large Language Models (LLMs) often result in overconfident or poorly calibrated estimates, especially on out-of-distribution or challenging tasks. This issue limits the reliability and practical applicability of LLMs in decision-critical scenarios where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches, such as direct confidence prompting, ensemble methods, and calibration using held-out data, have shown limited success in accurately capturing model uncertainty. Humans often express uncertainty using a spectrum of qualitative phrases, which inspired our approach. By prompting LLMs to generate responses across a range of confidence levels, we aim to obtain more nuanced and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This method leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to provide a more comprehensive view of its confidence, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Prompting (CSP), a novel method for eliciting uncertainty estimates from LLMs. The key steps of CSP are: 1) Prompt the LLM to generate multiple responses at different confidence levels (e.g., '99% sure', '90% sure', '50% sure', etc.). 2) Include instructions in the prompt to consider different aspects of uncertainty (e.g., factual recall, reasoning steps) when generating each response. 3) Incorporate a meta-prompt asking the model to reflect on its confidence spectrum and provide a final calibrated estimate. 4) Analyze the consistency and content of these responses to derive a final confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering different types of tasks: a) TriviaQA for factual question answering, b) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, c) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, and d) a custom out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset created by combining questions from different domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct confidence prompting: Ask the LLM to provide an answer and a confidence score. b) Ensemble method: Use multiple runs of the LLM and calculate the agreement. c) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to generate multiple outputs and estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CSP Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Spectrum Prompting method: a) Design a prompt template that asks for responses at 99%, 90%, 70%, 50%, and 30% confidence levels. b) Include instructions to consider different aspects of uncertainty. c) Add a meta-prompt for final reflection. Example prompt: 'Please answer the following question at different confidence levels. Consider aspects such as factual recall, reasoning steps, and potential ambiguities. For each confidence level, provide your answer and explain your thought process. Question: [INSERT QUESTION HERE] 99% confidence: 90% confidence: 70% confidence: 50% confidence: 30% confidence: Now, reflect on your answers across different confidence levels and provide a final calibrated estimate of your confidence in answering this question.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI API for the main experiments. Additionally, use open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method: a) Generate responses for all questions. b) For CSP, analyze the spectrum of responses to derive a final confidence estimate. c) For ensemble method, use 5 runs per question. d) For temperature scaling, use temperatures of 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "a) Calculate calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). b) Evaluate performance on selective prediction tasks by allowing the model to abstain on low-confidence predictions. c) Analyze the consistency and coherence of responses across the confidence spectrum. d) Compare the performance of CSP against baselines across different task types and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Examine how confidence estimates vary across different task types and difficulty levels. b) Analyze the relationship between the spread of confidence spectrum and actual performance. c) Investigate cases where CSP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. d) Study the impact of different confidence thresholds on selective prediction performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Confidence Spectrum Prompting)": "Please answer the following question at different confidence levels. Consider aspects such as factual recall, reasoning steps, and potential ambiguities. For each confidence level, provide your answer and explain your thought process. Question: What is the capital of France? 99% confidence: 90% confidence: 70% confidence: 50% confidence: 30% confidence: Now, reflect on your answers across different confidence levels and provide a final calibrated estimate of your confidence in answering this question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Spectrum Prompting)": "99% confidence: The capital of France is Paris. I'm extremely confident in this answer as it's a well-known fact that I've encountered numerous times. 90% confidence: The capital of France is Paris. I'm very confident, but there's a small chance I might be confusing it with another major European city. 70% confidence: I believe the capital of France is Paris, but I'm not entirely sure. There's a possibility it could be another large French city like Lyon or Marseille. 50% confidence: I'm uncertain, but I think the capital of France might be Paris. However, I'm equally likely to be wrong, and it could be another city. 30% confidence: I'm very unsure about the capital of France. It might be Paris, but it could also be any other major French city. I wouldn't rely on this answer without verification. Reflection: After considering my responses across different confidence levels, I realize that my initial high confidence was warranted. The consistency in naming Paris across all levels, even when expressing doubt, suggests that this information is deeply ingrained. However, the exercise made me aware that there's always a small possibility of error or confusion. Therefore, my final calibrated estimate of confidence in answering this question is 98%. While I'm very confident that Paris is the capital of France, I acknowledge a tiny margin for potential mistakes or unusual circumstances I might not be aware of.",
            "Explanation": "The Confidence Spectrum Prompting method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence. It reveals the model's thought process at different confidence levels, allowing for a more accurate final calibrated estimate. This approach also demonstrates the model's ability to consider potential sources of error and ambiguity, leading to a slightly more conservative (and likely more accurate) final confidence estimate compared to the direct confidence prompting method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Confidence Spectrum Prompting method doesn't significantly improve calibration or uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated confidence spectrums to understand patterns in how LLMs express uncertainty across different tasks and difficulty levels. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in self-assessment. 2) Explore variations of the CSP method, such as adjusting the number and distribution of confidence levels, or experimenting with different phrasings for eliciting confidence. 3) Investigate the relationship between the consistency of answers across the confidence spectrum and the actual correctness of answers. This could lead to a new metric for assessing answer reliability. 4) Combine CSP with other methods like ensemble techniques or external knowledge retrieval to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple uncertainty quantification strategies. 5) Focus on specific task types where CSP shows the most promise and conduct a more detailed study on how to optimize the method for those particular tasks."
