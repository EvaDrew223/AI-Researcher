        "Problem": "Large language models often fail to account for contextual factors that should increase uncertainty, leading to overconfidence in ambiguous situations.",

        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contextual Uncertainty Amplification (CUA), which operates as follows: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate for a given query. 2) Systematically introduce contextual factors that should increase uncertainty (e.g., time pressure, conflicting information, high stakes). 3) Prompt the model to reassess its confidence in light of each new context. 4) Aggregate these contextual reassessments to produce a final, context-aware uncertainty estimate. 5) Optionally, prompt the model to explain how each context affects its confidence, providing interpretable uncertainty quantification.",

        "Title": "Contextual Uncertainty Amplification: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often fail to account for contextual factors that should increase uncertainty, leading to overconfidence in ambiguous situations. This problem is particularly acute in real-world scenarios where contextual information can significantly impact the reliability of model predictions.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in language models typically focus on model-intrinsic uncertainty without explicitly considering contextual amplifiers. By systematically introducing uncertainty-amplifying contexts, we can reveal hidden uncertainties and improve calibration in real-world scenarios. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to produce more nuanced and context-aware uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contextual Uncertainty Amplification (CUA), which operates as follows: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate for a given query. 2) Systematically introduce contextual factors that should increase uncertainty (e.g., time pressure, conflicting information, high stakes). 3) Prompt the model to reassess its confidence in light of each new context. 4) Aggregate these contextual reassessments to produce a final, context-aware uncertainty estimate. 5) Optionally, prompt the model to explain how each context affects its confidence, providing interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a benchmark dataset of context-sensitive queries across various domains (e.g., science, current events, general knowledge). Each query should have a ground truth answer and be paired with 3-5 uncertainty-amplifying contexts.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Selection": "Choose GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 as the primary models for evaluation. Also include an open-source model like LLaMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods: a) Direct confidence estimation (ask the model to provide a confidence score), b) Monte Carlo Dropout (if applicable to the chosen models), c) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using different model versions or temperatures.",
            "Step 4: Implement CUA": "Develop prompts for each step of the CUA process: a) Initial response generation, b) Contextual factor introduction, c) Confidence reassessment, d) Aggregation of reassessments, e) Optional explanation generation.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each query in the benchmark dataset: a) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates using baseline methods and CUA. b) Compare the calibration of uncertainty estimates using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score. c) Assess the quality and relevance of uncertainty explanations through automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) and limited human evaluation.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, including: a) Performance comparison across different types of queries and domains. b) Impact of different contextual factors on uncertainty estimates. c) Correlation between uncertainty estimates and actual model performance. d) Qualitative assessment of uncertainty explanations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who will win the 2024 US Presidential election?\nA: Provide your best prediction and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on current polling and political trends, it's likely that the incumbent President Joe Biden will face a Republican challenger, possibly former President Donald Trump or another prominent Republican figure. However, it's far too early to make a definitive prediction about the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential election. Many factors can change between now and the election date, including economic conditions, international events, and unforeseen circumstances that could impact public opinion.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the long time frame before the election, I would refrain from making a specific prediction about who will win. Instead, I can say that the race is likely to be competitive, with both major parties having a reasonable chance of victory.\n\nConfidence score: 30 out of 100\n\nThis low confidence score reflects the high level of uncertainty this far in advance of the election and the many variables that could influence the outcome.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who will win the 2024 US Presidential election?\nA: Provide your best prediction and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "[Same as Baseline Output]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Introduce Context)": "Now, consider the following additional context: Recent polls show a significant shift in public opinion on key issues. How does this affect your prediction and confidence?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Introduce Context)": "The recent shift in public opinion on key issues adds another layer of uncertainty to the prediction. This could potentially change the dynamics of the race, affecting both the candidates' strategies and voter preferences. It's important to note that polls can be volatile and may not always accurately predict election outcomes, especially this far in advance.\n\nGiven this new information, I would maintain my stance of not making a specific prediction about who will win the 2024 US Presidential election. The race remains likely to be competitive, but the shifting public opinion introduces more variables to consider.\n\nRevised confidence score: 20 out of 100\n\nThis further reduced confidence score reflects the increased uncertainty due to the changing public opinion landscape, which makes the election outcome even more difficult to predict at this stage.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Final Aggregation)": "Based on your initial assessment and the consideration of additional context, provide a final prediction and confidence score, explaining how the contextual factors influenced your uncertainty estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Final Aggregation)": "Final prediction: It is not possible to confidently predict the winner of the 2024 US Presidential election at this time.\n\nFinal confidence score: 15 out of 100\n\nExplanation of uncertainty estimate:\nThe initial low confidence (30/100) was based on the long time frame before the election and the many variables that could influence the outcome. The introduction of additional context regarding shifting public opinion further reduced the confidence to 20/100, as it added another layer of uncertainty to an already complex prediction task.\n\nThe final confidence score of 15/100 reflects an aggregation of these factors and emphasizes the high level of uncertainty in this prediction. This very low confidence is justified by:\n\n1. The long time frame before the election (over a year), during which many events could significantly impact the race.\n2. The potential for changes in the candidate field, especially for the challenging party.\n3. The volatility of public opinion on key issues, as indicated by recent polls.\n4. The historical unreliability of early predictions in presidential elections.\n5. The potential for unforeseen national or global events that could dramatically shift the political landscape.\n\nThis low confidence score underscores the importance of treating any current predictions about the 2024 election outcome with extreme caution and emphasizes the need for continual reassessment as new information becomes available closer to the election date.",
            "explanation": "The CUA method demonstrates a more nuanced approach to uncertainty estimation. By explicitly considering additional context (shifting public opinion), the model reduces its confidence and provides a more detailed explanation of its uncertainty. This process reveals hidden uncertainties that were not captured in the initial response, leading to a more calibrated and interpretable uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CUA method does not significantly improve calibration over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of which types of contextual factors are most effective at revealing model uncertainty, potentially uncovering insights about the model's reasoning process. 2) Investigate whether the explanations generated by CUA, even if not improving calibration, provide valuable transparency that could be useful for downstream applications or human-AI collaboration. 3) Explore whether CUA is more effective for certain types of queries or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Analyze cases where CUA performs poorly to identify potential improvements to the prompting strategy or aggregation method. 5) Compare the effectiveness of CUA across different model sizes and architectures to understand if its impact varies based on model capacity or training approach."
