    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately reflect their changing confidence levels as they process information sequentially, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in different parts of their responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods focus on static confidence estimation at the end of generation or use simple averaging techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence often oscillates as we process information, and capturing this dynamic could provide more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Oscillation Tracking (COT), a novel prompting method that elicits fine-grained confidence estimates throughout the generation process. The LLM is prompted to output a confidence score (0-100) after each sentence or logical unit, along with a brief explanation for any significant changes. These scores are then used to construct a confidence trajectory. The prompt also encourages the model to revise earlier statements if later information significantly changes its confidence. Finally, the overall confidence is computed using a weighted average that emphasizes more recent estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare COT with standard end-of-generation confidence estimation and rolling average methods on question-answering tasks with deliberately inserted ambiguities or contradictions. Evaluate using calibration metrics, correlation with human judgments of model confidence, and ability to detect and correct errors."

        "Title": "Dynamic Confidence Oscillation Tracking: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately reflect their changing confidence levels as they process information sequentially, often leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in different parts of their responses. This issue hampers the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically focus on static confidence scores at the end of generation or use simple averaging techniques. These approaches fail to capture the nuanced dynamics of confidence that humans exhibit when processing information sequentially. Human confidence often oscillates as we encounter new information, and capturing this dynamic could provide more accurate and interpretable uncertainty quantification in LLMs. By developing a method that tracks these confidence oscillations, we can potentially improve the model's ability to recognize its own limitations and provide more reliable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Oscillation Tracking (COT), a novel prompting method that elicits fine-grained confidence estimates throughout the generation process. The method works as follows: 1) The LLM is prompted to output a confidence score (0-100) after each sentence or logical unit of its response. 2) The model is also asked to provide a brief explanation for any significant changes in confidence. 3) These scores are used to construct a confidence trajectory for the entire response. 4) The prompt encourages the model to revise earlier statements if later information significantly changes its confidence. 5) The overall confidence is computed using a weighted average that emphasizes more recent estimates, reflecting the model's final state of knowledge.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) AmbigQA for questions with multiple possible answers. We will augment these datasets by inserting deliberate ambiguities or contradictions to test the model's ability to express uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard end-of-generation confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Rolling average method: Ask for confidence after every sentence and take the average.",
            "Step 3: COT Implementation": "Implement the COT method with the following prompt structure: 'Answer the following question. After each sentence, provide your confidence level (0-100) and a brief explanation if it changed significantly. If new information changes your confidence in previous statements, revise them. Question: [INSERT QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Generate responses using the baseline methods and COT. 2) Record the confidence scores, explanations, and any revisions made by the model. 3) For COT, construct the confidence trajectory for each response.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "1) Calibration: Compare the model's confidence scores with human-annotated correctness scores. 2) Correlation: Measure the correlation between the model's confidence trajectory and human judgments of model confidence at different points in the response. 3) Error Detection: Evaluate the model's ability to detect and correct errors in its own responses. 4) Ambiguity Handling: Assess how well the model expresses uncertainty for ambiguous questions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of COT against the baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze the patterns in confidence trajectories for different types of questions. 3) Examine the model's explanations for confidence changes to gain insights into its reasoning process. 4) Investigate cases where COT significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (End-of-generation confidence)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (End-of-generation confidence)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. He took his historic first steps on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nConfidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (COT)": "Answer the following question. After each sentence, provide your confidence level (0-100) and a brief explanation if it changed significantly. If new information changes your confidence in previous statements, revise them.\n\nQ: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (COT)": "The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. [Confidence: 95] (I'm highly confident in this fact as it's widely known and documented.)\n\nHe took his historic first steps on July 20, 1969. [Confidence: 98] (The specific date reinforces my confidence.)\n\nThis occurred during the Apollo 11 mission. [Confidence: 100] (Adding the mission name completes the key information, making me fully confident in the entire answer.)\n\nExplanation for confidence changes: My confidence increased slightly with each additional piece of corroborating information, reaching full confidence when all key details were included.",
            "Explanation": "The COT method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence throughout its response. It shows how confidence can increase as more supporting details are added, and allows for potential revisions if contradictory information were to be recalled. This dynamic confidence tracking offers more insight into the model's reasoning process compared to the static end-of-generation confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed COT method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of the confidence trajectories to understand why they might not be more informative than static confidence scores. This could lead to insights about how LLMs process information sequentially. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from COT than others, which could inform more targeted applications of the method. 3) Explore variations of the COT method, such as asking for confidence at key decision points rather than after every sentence, or experimenting with different ways of aggregating the confidence scores. 4) Analyze the explanations provided for confidence changes to gain insights into the model's reasoning process, which could inform future improvements in prompt engineering or model design. 5) If the revisions aspect of COT proves valuable, we could focus on developing this into a separate method for improving the factual accuracy of LLM outputs."
