        "Problem": "LLMs often have difficulty identifying the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in areas where their knowledge transitions from certain to uncertain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on global calibration or simple thresholding, without explicitly probing knowledge boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "Expert human reasoners can often precisely identify where their knowledge becomes uncertain, allowing for more trustworthy and actionable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Boundary Mapping, a prompting technique designed to precisely locate and characterize the boundaries of model certainty. The method involves: 1) Anchor Generation: Prompt the model to generate high-confidence exemplars related to the query. 2) Boundary Exploration: Iteratively modify these exemplars, prompting the model to assess its confidence at each step, until a significant confidence drop is detected. 3) Boundary Characterization: Once boundaries are identified, prompt the model to explicitly describe what distinguishes the certain from the uncertain regions. 4) Confidence Refinement: Use the boundary information to refine the original confidence estimate for the query. This approach allows for more precise and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on diverse tasks including fact-checking, scientific reasoning, and open-domain QA. Compare against standard confidence estimation techniques using calibration metrics and measures of boundary precision. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the boundary characterizations."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Boundary Mapping: Precise Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in areas where their knowledge transitions from certain to uncertain. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potentially harmful decisions when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on global calibration or simple thresholding, without explicitly probing knowledge boundaries. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced transitions between areas of certainty and uncertainty. In contrast, expert human reasoners can often precisely identify where their knowledge becomes uncertain, allowing for more trustworthy and actionable confidence estimates. By developing a method that mimics this human-like ability to map knowledge boundaries, we can significantly improve the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Boundary Mapping (CCBM), a prompting technique designed to precisely locate and characterize the boundaries of model certainty. The method involves four key steps: 1) Anchor Generation: Prompt the model to generate high-confidence exemplars related to the query. 2) Boundary Exploration: Iteratively modify these exemplars, prompting the model to assess its confidence at each step, until a significant confidence drop is detected. 3) Boundary Characterization: Once boundaries are identified, prompt the model to explicitly describe what distinguishes the certain from the uncertain regions. 4) Confidence Refinement: Use the boundary information to refine the original confidence estimate for the query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking, 2) ScienceQA for scientific reasoning, and 3) Natural Questions for open-domain QA. Preprocess these datasets to ensure compatibility with our prompting framework.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: 1) Softmax probabilities, 2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and 3) Ensemble methods using different model checkpoints or temperatures.",
            "Step 3: CCBM Implementation": "Implement the four steps of CCBM:\n1) Anchor Generation: Prompt: \"Generate 3 high-confidence statements related to [QUERY].\"\n2) Boundary Exploration: For each anchor, iteratively prompt: \"Modify the following statement to make it slightly less certain: [STATEMENT]. Also provide your confidence (0-100) in the modified statement.\"\n3) Boundary Characterization: Prompt: \"Describe the key factors that distinguish the certain from the uncertain aspects of [QUERY].\"\n4) Confidence Refinement: Prompt: \"Given the boundary analysis, refine your confidence (0-100) in the original answer to [QUERY].\"\n",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error), 2) Brier score, 3) AUC-ROC for confidence-based classification, and 4) Spearman correlation between confidence estimates and human judgments of correctness.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Design a small-scale human evaluation study to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the boundary characterizations. Recruit 5-10 domain experts to rate the quality of the boundary descriptions on a 1-5 Likert scale.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run the baseline methods and CCBM on all three datasets using the selected models. Collect confidence estimates, boundary characterizations, and refined confidence scores for each query.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CCBM against baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the effectiveness of each step in the CCBM process. Investigate how the method performs across different types of queries and knowledge domains.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing or modifying each step of CCBM to understand the contribution of each component. For example, test the performance without the boundary characterization step or with different numbers of anchor statements."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 99%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Anchor Generation)": "Generate 3 high-confidence statements related to the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Anchor Generation)": "1. Paris is the capital city of France. (Confidence: 100%)\n2. The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. (Confidence: 100%)\n3. Paris has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages. (Confidence: 98%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Boundary Exploration)": "Modify the following statement to make it slightly less certain: Paris has been the capital of France since the Middle Ages. Also provide your confidence (0-100) in the modified statement.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Boundary Exploration)": "Modified statement: Paris has been the capital of France since at least the late Middle Ages, though the exact date of its designation is debated. (Confidence: 90%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Boundary Characterization)": "Describe the key factors that distinguish the certain from the uncertain aspects of the question 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Boundary Characterization)": "Certain aspects:\n1. Paris is currently the capital of France.\n2. Paris has major landmarks associated with being the capital (e.g., government buildings).\n\nUncertain aspects:\n1. The exact date when Paris became the capital.\n2. Whether there were any brief periods in history when another city served as the capital.\n3. The full extent of Paris's metropolitan area that is considered part of the capital region.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Confidence Refinement)": "Given the boundary analysis, refine your confidence (0-100) in the original answer that Paris is the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Refinement)": "Refined confidence: 99.9%\n\nExplanation: While there is some uncertainty about historical details, the current status of Paris as the capital of France is extremely well-established and verified by multiple sources.",
            "Explanation": "The CCBM method provides a more nuanced and interpretable confidence estimate compared to the baseline. It identifies areas of certainty and uncertainty, and refines the confidence based on a detailed analysis of knowledge boundaries."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCBM method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why CCBM fails, which could lead to insights about LLM knowledge representation. 2) Investigate how different types of queries (e.g., factual vs. speculative) affect the performance of CCBM, potentially revealing patterns in LLM uncertainty across different knowledge domains. 3) Explore combining CCBM with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it as a feature in a meta-model for confidence estimation. 4) Analyze the generated boundary characterizations to gain insights into how LLMs conceptualize their own knowledge boundaries, which could be valuable for improving model interpretability and transparency."
