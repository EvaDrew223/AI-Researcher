    "topic_description": "novel prompting methods that can better quantify uncertainty or calibrate the confidence of large language models",
    "idea_name": "Contextual Uncertainty Injection",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in context-dependent scenarios, leading to overconfident responses in situations where ambiguity or multiple interpretations exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on global uncertainty estimation or post-processing techniques, which may not capture nuanced, context-specific uncertainties.",
        "Motivation": "By injecting contextual uncertainty directly into the prompt, we can guide the model to consider ambiguities and alternative interpretations more explicitly during generation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contextual Uncertainty Injection (CUI), a prompting technique that dynamically inserts uncertainty cues into the input context. The method involves: 1) Identifying potential sources of ambiguity in the input using a separate language model. 2) Generating multiple alternative phrasings or interpretations for ambiguous segments. 3) Constructing a prompt that incorporates these alternatives, encouraging the model to consider multiple perspectives. For example, given the query 'What is the capital of Georgia?', CUI might produce: 'Consider that 'Georgia' could refer to [the U.S. state | the country in Eurasia]. What is the capital of Georgia? Express your confidence level for each possible interpretation.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CUI against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on a range of tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity disambiguation. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and human judgments of expressed uncertainty."

        "Title": "Contextual Uncertainty Injection: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in context-dependent scenarios, leading to overconfident responses in situations where ambiguity or multiple interpretations exist. This issue can result in misleading or incorrect information being presented as factual, potentially leading to poor decision-making by users relying on these models.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in language models mainly focus on global uncertainty estimation or post-processing techniques, which may not capture nuanced, context-specific uncertainties. By injecting contextual uncertainty directly into the prompt, we can guide the model to consider ambiguities and alternative interpretations more explicitly during generation. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to reason about uncertainty, potentially leading to more accurate and calibrated responses without requiring extensive model modifications or additional training data.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contextual Uncertainty Injection (CUI), a prompting technique that dynamically inserts uncertainty cues into the input context. The method involves three main steps: 1) Identifying potential sources of ambiguity in the input using a separate language model. 2) Generating multiple alternative phrasings or interpretations for ambiguous segments. 3) Constructing a prompt that incorporates these alternatives, encouraging the model to consider multiple perspectives. For example, given the query 'What is the capital of Georgia?', CUI might produce: 'Consider that 'Georgia' could refer to [the U.S. state | the country in Eurasia]. What is the capital of Georgia? Express your confidence level for each possible interpretation.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that cover a range of tasks prone to contextual ambiguity: 1) Question Answering: Use the AmbigQA dataset, which contains ambiguous questions with multiple valid answers. 2) Sentiment Analysis: Compile a custom dataset of movie reviews with ambiguous sentiment, sourced from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. 3) Named Entity Disambiguation: Use the AIDA-CoNLL dataset, focusing on entries with ambiguous entity mentions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Selection": "Choose GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 as the primary models for evaluation. Also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: Direct querying without uncertainty cues. 2) Global uncertainty estimation: Use softmax temperature scaling on model logits. 3) Existing CoT prompting: Append 'Let's approach this step-by-step:' to each query.",
            "Step 4: Implement CUI Method": "Develop the CUI pipeline: a) Ambiguity Detection: Fine-tune a BERT model on a subset of the AmbigQA dataset to identify potentially ambiguous terms in input queries. b) Alternative Generation: Use GPT-3.5 to generate alternative interpretations for identified ambiguous terms. c) Prompt Construction: Create a template that incorporates the original query, identified ambiguities, and alternative interpretations.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between predicted probabilities and empirical frequencies. 2) Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) F1 Score: Evaluate the accuracy of answers, considering all valid interpretations. 4) Human Evaluation: Recruit 3 expert annotators to rate a subset of 100 responses on a 5-point Likert scale for expressed uncertainty and answer quality.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect responses. b) Apply the CUI method and collect responses. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for all methods. d) Conduct human evaluation on the subset of responses.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform statistical analysis to compare CUI against baselines: a) Conduct paired t-tests to assess significant differences in metric scores. b) Analyze performance across different types of ambiguities and task domains. c) Examine cases where CUI significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of each component of CUI: a) Compare performance with and without the ambiguity detection step. b) Vary the number of alternative interpretations generated. c) Experiment with different prompt construction templates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "What is the capital of Georgia?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The capital of Georgia is Atlanta.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUI)": "Consider that 'Georgia' could refer to [the U.S. state | the country in Eurasia]. What is the capital of Georgia? Express your confidence level for each possible interpretation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CUI)": "Given the ambiguity in the question, I'll provide answers for both interpretations:\n\n1. If 'Georgia' refers to the U.S. state:\n   Capital: Atlanta\n   Confidence: 100%\n\n2. If 'Georgia' refers to the country in Eurasia:\n   Capital: Tbilisi\n   Confidence: 100%\n\nWithout additional context, both interpretations are equally valid, so I'm 50% confident that the question refers to each interpretation.",
            "Explanation": "The CUI method prompts the model to consider multiple interpretations and express uncertainty, resulting in a more informative and calibrated response compared to the baseline method, which provides a single answer without acknowledging the ambiguity."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CUI method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify patterns in cases where CUI fails to improve uncertainty quantification. This could reveal insights into the limitations of prompt-based approaches and inform future research directions. 2) Explore combining CUI with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or Monte Carlo Dropout, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. 3) Investigate the impact of CUI on different model sizes and architectures to understand if its effectiveness varies across different types of language models. 4) Extend the project to focus on analyzing how different prompting strategies affect model calibration and uncertainty expression, potentially uncovering general principles for designing prompts that encourage more accurate uncertainty quantification."
