        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize the limits of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use static prompts or simple iterative refinement techniques to improve response quality.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically evolving prompts based on detected uncertainties, we can guide the LLM to explore its knowledge boundaries and provide more accurate confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Guided Prompt Evolution (UGPE), a method that iteratively refines prompts based on detected uncertainties. Initially, we use a base prompt to generate a response and confidence estimate. We then analyze this output to identify areas of high uncertainty. Based on these uncertainty hotspots, we automatically generate targeted sub-prompts to probe these areas further. The process repeats, with each iteration refining the prompt to focus on uncertain aspects. The final response is constructed by combining information from all iterations, weighted by confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare UGPE with static prompting and other dynamic prompting methods on diverse tasks including open-ended question answering and fact verification. Evaluate using standard calibration metrics and a new metric for measuring improvement in uncertainty resolution across iterations."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Guided Prompt Evolution: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize the limits of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas of uncertainty. This can result in the propagation of misinformation and reduced trust in AI systems. Current approaches to address this issue typically use static prompts or simple iterative refinement techniques, which may not effectively capture the nuanced uncertainties in LLM responses.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for improving LLM response quality and confidence calibration often rely on static prompts or simple refinement techniques. These approaches may not fully leverage the model's ability to recognize and explore its own uncertainties. By dynamically evolving prompts based on detected uncertainties, we can guide the LLM to explore its knowledge boundaries more effectively and provide more accurate confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often refine our understanding of a topic by focusing on areas of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Guided Prompt Evolution (UGPE), a method that iteratively refines prompts based on detected uncertainties. The process works as follows:\n1. Initial Response: Use a base prompt to generate an initial response and confidence estimate.\n2. Uncertainty Detection: Analyze the output to identify areas of high uncertainty.\n3. Sub-prompt Generation: Automatically generate targeted sub-prompts to probe these uncertain areas further.\n4. Iterative Refinement: Repeat steps 1-3, with each iteration refining the prompt to focus on uncertain aspects.\n5. Final Response Construction: Combine information from all iterations, weighted by confidence, to produce the final response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets for evaluation:\n- Open-ended QA: Use the TruthfulQA dataset\n- Fact Verification: Use the FEVER dataset\n- Multi-hop reasoning: Use the HotpotQA dataset",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the question\n2. Static uncertainty prompting: Append 'How confident are you about this answer?' to each question\n3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Append 'Let's approach this step by step' to each question",
            "Step 3: UGPE Implementation": "1. Initial prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'\n2. Uncertainty detection: Implement a function to analyze the response and identify uncertain aspects based on:\n   - Low confidence score\n   - Presence of uncertainty markers (e.g., 'maybe', 'possibly', 'I'm not sure')\n   - Inconsistencies or vague statements\n3. Sub-prompt generation: Create a template for generating sub-prompts, e.g., 'You seem uncertain about [UNCERTAIN_ASPECT]. Can you elaborate on this specific point?'\n4. Iterative refinement: Implement a loop to repeat steps 1-3 for a maximum of 3 iterations or until the confidence score exceeds 90\n5. Final response construction: Implement a function to combine information from all iterations, giving more weight to high-confidence responses",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1. Accuracy: Use dataset-specific accuracy metrics\n2. Calibration: Implement Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)\n3. Uncertainty Resolution: Implement a new metric to measure the improvement in uncertainty resolution across iterations, calculated as the average increase in confidence score from the first to the last iteration",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "1. Run all baselines and UGPE on the selected datasets using both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4\n2. For each method and dataset, generate responses for at least 1000 questions\n3. Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method and model",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare UGPE performance against baselines using the defined metrics\n2. Analyze the progression of uncertainty resolution across iterations\n3. Identify patterns in the types of questions where UGPE shows the most improvement\n4. Examine generated sub-prompts to understand how they contribute to uncertainty resolution"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first confirmed climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UGPE; Iteration 1)": "Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: Who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UGPE; Iteration 1)": "Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first confirmed climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953. Confidence score: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UGPE; Iteration 2)": "You seem uncertain about whether there were any unconfirmed climbers before Hillary and Norgay. Can you elaborate on this specific point?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UGPE; Iteration 2)": "There have been some claims and debates about possible earlier ascents of Mount Everest, most notably the 1924 expedition of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. They disappeared high on the mountain, and it remains unknown whether they reached the summit before their deaths. However, due to lack of conclusive evidence, Hillary and Norgay are still recognized as the first confirmed climbers to reach the summit. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UGPE; Final Response)": "Combine the information from the previous responses, focusing on the most confident aspects:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UGPE; Final Response)": "Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first confirmed climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953. While there have been debates about possible earlier ascents, particularly the 1924 expedition of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, no conclusive evidence exists to support these claims. Therefore, Hillary and Norgay remain recognized as the first to successfully climb Mount Everest. Confidence score: 98",
            "Explanation": "The UGPE method allows the model to explore and address areas of uncertainty, resulting in a more comprehensive and nuanced response with higher confidence. The final answer acknowledges the confirmed achievement while also mentioning the historical debate, providing a more accurate representation of the current state of knowledge on this topic."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UGPE does not significantly improve performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Uncertainty Analysis: Conduct an in-depth analysis of the types of uncertainties detected and how they evolve across iterations. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and limitations.\n2. Prompt Engineering Study: Investigate how different formulations of the initial prompt and sub-prompts affect the uncertainty detection and resolution process. This could lead to a paper on effective prompt design for uncertainty calibration.\n3. Multi-Model Approach: Extend UGPE to use multiple models or model versions for different stages of the process (e.g., one for initial response, another for uncertainty detection). Compare this to the single-model approach to understand if model specialization improves performance.\n4. Task-Specific Calibration: Analyze how UGPE performance varies across different types of tasks and knowledge domains. This could lead to insights on task-specific calibration strategies.\n5. Hybrid Approach: Combine UGPE with external knowledge retrieval methods to see if this improves factual accuracy while maintaining good calibration."
