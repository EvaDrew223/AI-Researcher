        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overconfident responses to complex queries, failing to recognize when their knowledge is incomplete or fragmented across different semantic domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess confidence holistically for an entire response, missing nuanced uncertainties in specific components of the answer.",
        "Motivation": "Complex queries often span multiple semantic domains, and an LLM's confidence may vary across these domains. By decomposing queries and responses into semantic fragments, we can obtain a more granular and accurate uncertainty assessment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Fragmentation for Uncertainty Quantification (SFUQ), a prompting technique that breaks down complex queries into semantic components and assesses uncertainty for each component separately. The process involves: 1) Prompt the LLM to identify key semantic components of the query. 2) For each component, generate a sub-query and obtain a response with a confidence estimate. 3) Prompt the LLM to analyze potential interactions and dependencies between components. 4) Finally, synthesize the component-wise uncertainties and their interactions into a comprehensive uncertainty profile for the original query. This approach allows for nuanced uncertainty estimation that can identify specific areas of low confidence within an otherwise confident response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SFUQ on a dataset of complex, multi-domain queries spanning areas like interdisciplinary scientific problems, multi-step reasoning tasks, and cross-cultural analyses. We'll compare SFUQ's granular uncertainty profiles against holistic confidence estimates from baseline methods, measuring their correlation with human expert judgments and their ability to identify specific knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty within responses."

        "Title": "Semantic Fragmentation for Uncertainty Quantification: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overconfident responses to complex queries, failing to recognize when their knowledge is incomplete or fragmented across different semantic domains. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically assess confidence holistically for an entire response, missing nuanced uncertainties in specific components of the answer. Complex queries often span multiple semantic domains, and an LLM's confidence may vary across these domains. By decomposing queries and responses into semantic fragments, we can obtain a more granular and accurate uncertainty assessment. This approach allows for nuanced uncertainty estimation that can identify specific areas of low confidence within an otherwise confident response, potentially improving the overall reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Fragmentation for Uncertainty Quantification (SFUQ), a prompting technique that breaks down complex queries into semantic components and assesses uncertainty for each component separately. The process involves four main steps: 1) Prompt the LLM to identify key semantic components of the query. 2) For each component, generate a sub-query and obtain a response with a confidence estimate. 3) Prompt the LLM to analyze potential interactions and dependencies between components. 4) Finally, synthesize the component-wise uncertainties and their interactions into a comprehensive uncertainty profile for the original query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of 500 complex, multi-domain queries spanning areas like interdisciplinary scientific problems, multi-step reasoning tasks, and cross-cultural analyses. Ensure that each query requires knowledge from at least two distinct domains. For each query, have human experts provide ground truth answers and identify the key semantic components.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with holistic confidence estimation, and 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with holistic confidence estimation.",
            "Step 3: SFUQ Implementation": "Implement the SFUQ method with the following sub-steps: a) Semantic component identification, b) Sub-query generation and confidence estimation, c) Component interaction analysis, d) Uncertainty profile synthesis.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess the method's generalizability.",
            "Step 5: Prompts Design": "Design prompts for each step of the SFUQ method and the baseline methods. For SFUQ, create prompts for semantic component identification, sub-query generation, confidence estimation, component interaction analysis, and uncertainty profile synthesis.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments using both baseline methods and SFUQ on the prepared dataset. For each query, record the final answer, confidence estimates, and intermediate outputs (for SFUQ).",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Answer accuracy, 2) Calibration error (comparing estimated confidence with actual correctness), 3) Uncertainty profile quality (assessed by human experts), and 4) Correlation between granular uncertainty estimates and human expert judgments.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of SFUQ with baselines, 2) Analysis of cases where SFUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines, 3) Assessment of the quality and relevance of identified semantic components, and 4) Evaluation of the synthesized uncertainty profiles."

            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "What are the potential environmental and economic impacts of implementing a carbon tax in a developing country with a large agricultural sector? Provide your answer along with a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Implementing a carbon tax in a developing country with a large agricultural sector could have several environmental and economic impacts:\n\n1. Environmental impacts:\n   - Reduced greenhouse gas emissions as industries and individuals are incentivized to lower their carbon footprint\n   - Potential shift towards cleaner energy sources and more sustainable agricultural practices\n   - Improved air and water quality as a result of reduced pollution\n\n2. Economic impacts:\n   - Increased costs for energy-intensive industries, potentially leading to reduced competitiveness in the short term\n   - Potential job losses in carbon-intensive sectors, but possible job creation in green industries\n   - Revenue generation for the government, which could be used for environmental programs or to offset other taxes\n   - Possible inflation as increased costs are passed on to consumers\n   - Challenges for the agricultural sector, which may face higher input costs (e.g., for fertilizers and machinery)\n\n3. Socioeconomic considerations:\n   - Potential disproportionate impact on low-income households, who may struggle with higher energy and food prices\n   - Need for policies to mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable populations\n\nHowever, the specific impacts would depend on the design of the carbon tax, the country's economic structure, and complementary policies.\n\nConfidence score: 80\n\nWhile I'm confident in the general principles and potential impacts of a carbon tax, the specific outcomes in a developing country with a large agricultural sector may vary based on numerous factors that are not fully specified in the question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFUQ; Step 1: Semantic Component Identification)": "Identify the key semantic components of the following query: 'What are the potential environmental and economic impacts of implementing a carbon tax in a developing country with a large agricultural sector?'",

Characteristics of developing countries\n4. Large agricultural sector considerations\n5. Carbon tax implementation process",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFUQ; Step 2: Sub-query Generation and Confidence Estimation)": "Generate a sub-query for the semantic component 'Environmental impacts of carbon tax' and provide an answer with a confidence score from 0 to 100.",

Reduced greenhouse gas emissions as industries and individuals are incentivized to lower their carbon footprint\n2. Shift towards cleaner energy sources and more sustainable practices\n3. Improved air and water quality as a result of reduced pollution\n4. Potential increase in forest cover and biodiversity as carbon sequestration becomes more valuable\n5. Accelerated development and adoption of green technologies\n\nConfidence score: 90\n\nI'm highly confident in these general environmental impacts of a carbon tax, as they are well-documented in environmental economics literature and have been observed in countries that have implemented such taxes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFUQ; Step 3: Component Interaction Analysis)": "Analyze the potential interactions and dependencies between the environmental impacts and the large agricultural sector considerations in the context of implementing a carbon tax in a developing country.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFUQ; Step 3: Component Interaction Analysis)": "Interactions and dependencies between environmental impacts and large agricultural sector considerations:\n\n1. Emission reduction vs. agricultural productivity: The agricultural sector, being a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., methane from livestock, CO2 from deforestation), may face pressure to reduce emissions. This could lead to changes in farming practices, potentially affecting crop yields and livestock production in the short term.\n\n2. Sustainable practices adoption: The carbon tax may encourage the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices (e.g., no-till farming, improved irrigation systems), which could have positive environmental impacts but may require initial investments and adaptation periods for farmers.\n\n3. Land use changes: The increased value of carbon sequestration could lead to reforestation or afforestation efforts, potentially competing with agricultural land use. This could have positive environmental impacts but may pose challenges for agricultural expansion.\n\n4. Water resource management: Improved environmental practices could lead to better water quality and more efficient water use, benefiting both the environment and the agricultural sector in the long run.\n\n5. Climate resilience: While the primary goal of a carbon tax is mitigation, the environmental benefits may also contribute to climate change adaptation, which is crucial for the agricultural sector in developing countries.\n\nConfidence in interaction analysis: 75\n\nWhile I'm confident in identifying these potential interactions, the specific outcomes and their magnitudes would depend on various factors such as the country's specific agricultural practices, climate, and the design of the carbon tax policy.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFUQ; Step 4: Uncertainty Profile Synthesis)": "Synthesize a comprehensive uncertainty profile for the original query about the environmental and economic impacts of implementing a carbon tax in a developing country with a large agricultural sector, based on the component-wise confidence estimates and interaction analysis.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFUQ; Step 4: Uncertainty Profile Synthesis)": "Comprehensive Uncertainty Profile:\n\n1. Overall confidence: 80/100\n\n2. Component-wise confidence:\n   a. Environmental impacts: 90/100\n   b. Economic impacts: 85/100\n   c. Developing country context: 75/100\n   d. Large agricultural sector considerations: 80/100\n   e. Carbon tax implementation: 70/100\n\n3. Areas of high certainty:\n   - General environmental benefits of carbon tax (e.g., emission reduction, shift to cleaner energy)\n   - Broad economic principles (e.g., increased costs for carbon-intensive industries, revenue generation for government)\n\n4. Areas of lower certainty:\n   - Specific outcomes in the agricultural sector\n   - Magnitude of economic impacts in a developing country context\n   - Effectiveness of carbon tax implementation in a developing country\n\n5. Key uncertainties:\n   - The capacity of the developing country's institutions to effectively implement and enforce a carbon tax\n   - The resilience of the agricultural sector to potential short-term economic shocks\n   - The availability of alternative technologies and practices in the specific country context\n   - The interaction between global market forces and local policy implementation\n\n6. Potential for unexpected outcomes:\n   - Moderate to high, particularly in the intersection of environmental policy and agricultural practices in a developing country context\n\nThis uncertainty profile reflects high confidence in the general principles and potential impacts of a carbon tax, but acknowledges the complexities and potential variabilities when applied to a developing country with a large agricultural sector. The lower confidence in specific outcomes and implementation effectiveness highlights the need for careful policy design and consideration of local contexts.",
            "explanation": "The SFUQ method provides a more nuanced and detailed uncertainty assessment compared to the baseline method. By breaking down the query into semantic components and analyzing their interactions, SFUQ captures uncertainties that might be overlooked in a holistic approach. The final uncertainty profile offers a comprehensive view of the confidence levels across different aspects of the query, highlighting areas of high certainty and identifying specific knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty within the response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SFUQ method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the semantic fragmentation process to understand why it didn't lead to improved uncertainty quantification. This could involve examining the quality and relevance of the identified semantic components, the accuracy of sub-query responses, and the effectiveness of the interaction analysis. 2) Investigate whether SFUQ performs better on specific types of queries or domains, which could lead to insights about when semantic fragmentation is most useful for uncertainty quantification. 3) Explore alternative methods of combining the component-wise uncertainties, such as using weighted averages based on the relevance of each component or employing more sophisticated probabilistic models. 4) Analyze the cases where SFUQ performed poorly compared to baselines to identify potential improvements or limitations of the method. 5) Consider integrating SFUQ with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble approaches or calibration techniques, to create a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches. These analyses and modifications could turn the project into a comprehensive study of semantic-based uncertainty quantification in LLMs, providing valuable insights even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
