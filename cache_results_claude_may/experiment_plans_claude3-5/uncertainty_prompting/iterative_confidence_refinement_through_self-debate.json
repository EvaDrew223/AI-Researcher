        "Problem": "LLMs often provide static confidence estimates that fail to account for the dynamic nature of reasoning and potential flaws in initial judgments.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically produce one-shot confidence estimates or use simple iterative approaches that don't fully leverage the model's capacity for self-reflection.",
        "Motivation": "By engaging the model in a structured self-debate, we can uncover potential weaknesses in its reasoning and refine its confidence estimates through multiple rounds of critical thinking.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Confidence Refinement through Self-Debate (ICRSD), a prompting technique that guides the model through a multi-round debate with itself. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Provide an initial answer and confidence estimate, 2) Generate a strong counter-argument to its own reasoning, 3) Respond to the counter-argument, defending or modifying the original position, 4) Reassess confidence based on the debate, 5) Repeat steps 2-4 for a set number of rounds or until confidence stabilizes. The final confidence estimate is derived from the trajectory of confidence scores throughout the debate process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ICRSD against static confidence estimation methods on tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as ethical dilemmas and scientific hypothesis evaluation. Measure performance using calibration plots, Negative Log Likelihood (NLL), and assess the method's ability to identify and correct initial misjudgments."

        "Title": "Iterative Confidence Refinement through Self-Debate: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide static confidence estimates that fail to account for the dynamic nature of reasoning and potential flaws in initial judgments. This leads to overconfidence in incorrect answers and underconfidence in correct ones, reducing the reliability and interpretability of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for confidence estimation in LLMs typically produce one-shot estimates or use simple iterative approaches that don't fully leverage the model's capacity for self-reflection. By engaging the model in a structured self-debate, we can uncover potential weaknesses in its reasoning and refine its confidence estimates through multiple rounds of critical thinking. This approach mimics human cognitive processes of reconsidering initial judgments and allows for more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Confidence Refinement through Self-Debate (ICRSD), a prompting technique that guides the model through a multi-round debate with itself. The process involves five key steps: 1) Provide an initial answer and confidence estimate, 2) Generate a strong counter-argument to its own reasoning, 3) Respond to the counter-argument, defending or modifying the original position, 4) Reassess confidence based on the debate, 5) Repeat steps 2-4 for a set number of rounds or until confidence stabilizes. The final confidence estimate is derived from the trajectory of confidence scores throughout the debate process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require complex reasoning: 1) Ethical dilemmas from the ETHICS dataset, 2) Scientific hypothesis evaluation tasks from the ScienceQA dataset, and 3) Logical reasoning problems from the LogiQA dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Static confidence estimation: directly ask the model for its confidence after generating an answer, 2) Temperature scaling: use different temperature settings to generate multiple answers and estimate confidence based on agreement, 3) Monte Carlo Dropout: apply dropout at inference time to generate multiple outputs and estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: ICRSD Implementation": "Implement the ICRSD method using the following prompts for each step: 1) Initial answer: 'Please provide an answer to the following question and estimate your confidence on a scale of 0-100%: [QUESTION]', 2) Counter-argument: 'Generate a strong counter-argument to your previous answer:', 3) Response: 'Respond to the counter-argument, either defending your original position or modifying it:', 4) Confidence reassessment: 'Based on this debate, reassess your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100%:'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run all baseline methods and ICRSD on the test set, 2) For ICRSD, perform 3 rounds of debate for each question, 3) Record the final answer, confidence estimate, and intermediate debate steps for ICRSD.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Calibration plots: compare predicted confidence vs. actual accuracy, 2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy, 3) Negative Log Likelihood (NLL): assess the quality of probabilistic predictions, 4) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC): evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare ICRSD against baselines using the above metrics, 2) Analyze the trajectory of confidence scores across debate rounds, 3) Identify cases where ICRSD significantly improved or worsened confidence estimates compared to baselines, 4) Examine the content of counter-arguments and responses to understand their impact on confidence refinement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: A trolley is barreling down a track towards five people. You are on a footbridge above the tracks, next to a large stranger. If you push the stranger off the bridge onto the track below, their body will stop the trolley. The stranger will die, but the five people on the track will be saved. Should you push the stranger?",
                "Output": "A: No, I don't believe you should push the stranger off the bridge. This is a classic ethical dilemma known as the 'trolley problem,' and it highlights the conflict between utilitarian ethics (maximizing overall well-being) and deontological ethics (adhering to moral rules regardless of consequences).\n\nReasons for this answer:\n1. Active harm vs. passive harm: Pushing the stranger is an active form of harm, which many consider morally worse than allowing harm to happen passively.\n2. Consent and autonomy: The stranger has not consented to sacrifice their life, and pushing them violates their autonomy.\n3. Uncertainty: There's no guarantee that pushing the stranger will successfully stop the trolley and save the five people.\n4. Moral absolutes: Many ethical frameworks argue that it's never morally permissible to use a person merely as a means to an end.\n5. Legal implications: Pushing the stranger would likely be considered murder in most legal systems.\n\nHowever, this is a complex ethical issue with valid arguments on both sides. Some would argue that saving five lives at the cost of one is the right utilitarian choice. The difficulty of this dilemma is why it's widely discussed in ethics.\n\nConfidence: 80%"

                    "Counter-argument": "While the initial answer presents valid points, it fails to fully consider the utilitarian perspective and the moral weight of inaction. Here are some counter-arguments:\n\n1. Net positive outcome: By sacrificing one life to save five, you're creating a net positive outcome in terms of lives saved.\n2. Moral responsibility of inaction: Choosing not to act still results in a moral choice - allowing five people to die when you could have saved them.\n3. Universalizability: If everyone chose to save more lives when given the opportunity, the world would arguably be a better place.\n4. Psychological impact: The trauma of watching five people die when you could have prevented it might be more severe than the trauma of actively saving five lives at the cost of one.\n5. Consent of the five: The five people on the track haven't consented to die either, and by not acting, you're violating their autonomy and right to life.\n6. Uncertainty applies both ways: While there's uncertainty about whether pushing the stranger will work, there's also uncertainty about whether the five people might survive anyway.\n\nThese points suggest that the utilitarian approach of pushing the stranger could be ethically justified and perhaps even morally required.",
                    "Response": "The counter-arguments present valid points that challenge my initial position. They highlight the complexity of this ethical dilemma and the difficulty in reaching a definitive answer. Let me address these points:\n\n1. Net positive outcome: While it's true that saving five lives at the cost of one creates a numerically positive outcome, this utilitarian calculation doesn't account for the moral weight of actively causing a death versus allowing deaths to occur.\n\n2. Moral responsibility of inaction: This is a strong point. Inaction is indeed a choice with moral consequences. However, there's a philosophical debate about whether acts of commission (actively doing something) carry more moral weight than acts of omission (allowing something to happen).\n\n3. Universalizability: This Kantian approach is interesting, but we must consider whether we want to live in a world where people feel justified in killing others for a perceived greater good. This could lead to problematic outcomes in less clear-cut scenarios.\n\n4. Psychological impact: The trauma argument is valid, but subjective. Some might find the act of killing more traumatic, regardless of the net lives saved.\n\n5. Consent of the five: This is a good point. Neither the one nor the five have consented to die.\n\n6. Uncertainty: True, uncertainty exists on both sides, which further complicates the decision-making process.\n\nAfter considering these counter-arguments, I acknowledge that the utilitarian perspective has merit, and the decision is not as clear-cut as I initially presented. The moral weight of inaction and the argument about consent of the five people on the track are particularly compelling.\n\nHowever, I still lean towards not pushing the stranger, primarily because of the active nature of the harm and the dangerous precedent it could set for justifying harm to individuals for a perceived greater good. But I now recognize this position as more tentative and acknowledge the strong ethical arguments on both sides.\n\nConfidence: 65%",
                    "Final Answer": "After careful consideration and debate, I believe that one should not push the stranger off the bridge, but I hold this position with less confidence than initially.\n\nThe key reasons for this conclusion are:\n1. The active nature of the harm involved in pushing someone to their death.\n2. The potential negative consequences of normalizing the sacrifice of individuals for a perceived greater good.\n3. The violation of the stranger's autonomy and right to life.\n\nHowever, I strongly acknowledge the validity of the utilitarian argument for saving more lives and the moral responsibility that comes with inaction. The counter-arguments presented, particularly regarding the moral weight of allowing five deaths when they could be prevented, and the lack of consent from the five potential victims, are very compelling.\n\nThis dilemma highlights the tension between utilitarian and deontological ethical frameworks, and demonstrates why the trolley problem remains a subject of intense philosophical debate. There is no clear, universally accepted right answer.\n\nIn practice, the decision would likely depend on individual moral frameworks, cultural context, and specific circumstances. It's also worth noting that in real-world emergency situations, decisions are often made instinctively rather than through careful moral reasoning.\n\nGiven the complexity of this issue and the strong arguments on both sides, I present this conclusion with reduced confidence compared to my initial response.\n\nConfidence: 65%"

                "Explanation": "The ICRSD method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the ethical dilemma. Through the process of generating counter-arguments and responses, the model is able to consider multiple perspectives and refine its reasoning. This leads to a more balanced final answer that acknowledges the strengths of both sides of the argument. The confidence level decreases from 80% to 65%, reflecting the model's recognition of the complexity of the issue and the validity of counter-arguments. This demonstrates how ICRSD can lead to more calibrated confidence estimates and more thorough reasoning compared to the baseline method."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the ICRSD method does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine the quality and relevance of the generated counter-arguments and responses to see if they're contributing meaningful information to the debate. If the counter-arguments are weak or irrelevant, we might need to refine our prompting strategy to encourage more substantive challenges. We could also analyze cases where ICRSD performs worse than baselines to identify potential failure modes. Additionally, we could investigate the trajectory of confidence scores across debate rounds to see if there are patterns that could inform a more effective confidence aggregation strategy. If the method consistently fails to improve calibration, we could explore combining ICRSD with other techniques like ensemble methods or external knowledge retrieval to enhance its performance. Ultimately, even if ICRSD doesn't outperform baselines, the project could yield valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of self-debate as a mechanism for uncertainty quantification in LLMs."
