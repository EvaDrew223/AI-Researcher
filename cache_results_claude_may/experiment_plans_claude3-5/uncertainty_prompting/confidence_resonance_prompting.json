    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple knowledge domains intersect.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in cross-domain reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, we hypothesize that probing a model's confidence across multiple related sub-problems can reveal more accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Resonance Prompting (CRP), which decomposes a complex query into a network of simpler, interconnected sub-queries. The model is prompted to solve each sub-query and provide confidence estimates. These estimates are then propagated through the network, allowing confidence 'waves' to interfere constructively or destructively. The final uncertainty is derived from the resonance patterns in this confidence network. Prompts are carefully crafted to encourage the model to consider interdependencies between sub-queries and adjust local confidences based on global context.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CRP against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on cross-domain reasoning tasks from datasets like MultiArith and MATH. Evaluate using calibration metrics and a novel 'resonance coherence score' that measures the stability of confidence estimates across related sub-problems."

        "Title": "Confidence Resonance Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple knowledge domains intersect. This issue is particularly pronounced when models are required to make decisions or provide answers in scenarios with incomplete or ambiguous information.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in cross-domain reasoning. Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, we hypothesize that probing a model's confidence across multiple related sub-problems can reveal more accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about interconnected pieces of information, potentially leading to more reliable and calibrated confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Resonance Prompting (CRP), which decomposes a complex query into a network of simpler, interconnected sub-queries. The process involves: 1) Decomposition: Breaking down the main query into a set of related sub-queries. 2) Confidence Elicitation: Prompting the model to solve each sub-query and provide confidence estimates. 3) Confidence Propagation: Allowing these estimates to propagate through the network, creating interference patterns. 4) Resonance Analysis: Deriving the final uncertainty from the resonance patterns in this confidence network. Prompts are carefully crafted to encourage the model to consider interdependencies between sub-queries and adjust local confidences based on global context.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the MultiArith dataset for arithmetic reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets provide a good mix of problems that require multi-step reasoning and cross-domain knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the model to solve the problem and provide a confidence score. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple model instances or different prompts to generate an ensemble of answers and derive confidence from agreement. 3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with confidence: Implement CoT prompting with an additional request for confidence at each step.",
            "Step 3: CRP Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Resonance Prompting method: a) Develop a system to automatically decompose problems into sub-queries. b) Create prompts for each sub-query that elicit both answers and confidence scores. c) Implement a confidence propagation algorithm that simulates resonance between interconnected sub-queries. d) Design a final prompt that synthesizes the sub-query results and confidence patterns into a final answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model, with GPT-3.5-turbo as a secondary model for comparison. Both will be accessed through the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the datasets: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their answers and confidence scores. b) Apply the CRP method, recording intermediate sub-query results, confidence scores, and the final synthesized answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: 1) Accuracy of final answers. 2) Calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error). 3) A novel 'resonance coherence score' that measures the stability of confidence estimates across related sub-problems. 4) Qualitative analysis of the confidence propagation patterns.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CRP against the baselines. Analyze how the decomposition into sub-queries and the confidence resonance affect the final uncertainty estimates. Investigate cases where CRP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Solve the following problem and provide your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and sells the rest at the farmers' market on Saturday. How many eggs will she have to sell at the market after 7 days?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Answer: After 7 days, Janet will have 91 eggs to sell at the market. Calculation: 16 eggs per day * 7 days = 112 total eggs. 3 eggs eaten per day * 7 days = 21 eggs eaten. 112 - 21 = 91 eggs to sell. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CRP; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Decompose the following problem into smaller, interconnected sub-questions: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and sells the rest at the farmers' market on Saturday. How many eggs will she have to sell at the market after 7 days?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CRP; Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. How many eggs do Janet's ducks lay in total over 7 days?\n2. How many eggs does Janet eat in total over 7 days?\n3. What is the difference between the total eggs laid and the eggs eaten?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CRP; Step 2: Confidence Elicitation for Sub-queries)": "Answer the following sub-question and provide your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%: How many eggs do Janet's ducks lay in total over 7 days?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CRP; Step 2: Confidence Elicitation for Sub-queries)": "Answer: Janet's ducks lay a total of 112 eggs over 7 days. Calculation: 16 eggs per day * 7 days = 112 eggs. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CRP; Step 3: Confidence Propagation)": "Given the following sub-query results and confidences, analyze how they affect each other's reliability: 1. Total eggs laid over 7 days: 112 (99% confidence) 2. Total eggs eaten over 7 days: 21 (98% confidence) 3. Difference between laid and eaten eggs: 91 (97% confidence)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CRP; Step 3: Confidence Propagation)": "Analysis: The high confidence in the first two sub-queries (99% and 98%) strongly supports the reliability of the third sub-query. The slight drop in confidence for the third sub-query (97%) likely accounts for potential calculation errors. The consistency between these results reinforces their overall reliability. Adjusted confidences: 1. 99% (unchanged) 2. 98% (unchanged) 3. 98% (slight increase due to corroboration from other sub-queries)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CRP; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on the sub-query results and confidence analysis, provide a final answer to the original question with an overall confidence estimate: How many eggs will Janet have to sell at the market after 7 days?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CRP; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Janet will have 91 eggs to sell at the market after 7 days. Overall Confidence: 98%. This high confidence is due to the consistent results across sub-queries and their interdependent verification. The slight uncertainty accounts for potential minor errors in calculation or unstated assumptions in the problem.",
            "Explanation": "The CRP method provides a more nuanced and potentially more reliable confidence estimate by breaking down the problem, analyzing sub-components, and considering their interdependencies. This approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment of uncertainty compared to the direct confidence elicitation, which might overlook subtle sources of uncertainty in complex problems."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CRP method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the decomposition process to understand why certain problem breakdowns are more effective than others. This could lead to insights on optimal problem decomposition strategies for language models. 2) Investigate the patterns of confidence propagation to identify common failure modes or unexpected behaviors in the model's uncertainty assessment. This could provide valuable insights into the model's reasoning process. 3) Explore hybrid approaches that combine elements of CRP with other methods like Chain-of-Thought or ensemble techniques. 4) Shift focus to analyzing how different types of problems benefit (or don't benefit) from the CRP approach, potentially leading to a taxonomy of problem types and their ideal uncertainty quantification methods. 5) Investigate the relationship between problem complexity and the effectiveness of CRP, which could inform when to apply more sophisticated uncertainty estimation techniques versus simpler methods."
