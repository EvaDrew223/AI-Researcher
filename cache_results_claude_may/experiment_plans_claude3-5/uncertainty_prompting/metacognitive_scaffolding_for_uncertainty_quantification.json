        "Problem": "LLMs often lack a structured approach to assessing their own uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates across different types of queries and knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing techniques typically treat uncertainty quantification as a single-step process without guiding the model through a systematic self-evaluation.",
        "Motivation": "By providing a metacognitive framework for self-evaluation, we can guide LLMs to more thoroughly and consistently assess their own uncertainty across diverse queries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Scaffolding for Uncertainty Quantification (MSUQ), a prompting technique that guides the LLM through a structured self-evaluation process: 1) Prompt the model to identify the type of knowledge or reasoning required for the query. 2) Guide the model to assess its familiarity and expertise in the relevant domain. 3) Ask the model to outline potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., ambiguity in the query, conflicting information, lack of specific knowledge). 4) Prompt the model to estimate its confidence for different aspects of the query separately. 5) Guide the model to synthesize these assessments into a final calibrated confidence score. Each step uses carefully designed prompts to encourage thorough metacognitive reasoning.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MSUQ against standard confidence estimation methods across a diverse set of tasks and knowledge domains (e.g., MMLU, TruthfulQA, scientific reasoning datasets). Evaluate improvements in calibration metrics, consistency of uncertainty quantification across domains, and the model's ability to provide justifications for its confidence estimates."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Scaffolding for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack a structured approach to assessing their own uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates across different types of queries and knowledge domains. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing techniques typically treat uncertainty quantification as a single-step process without guiding the model through a systematic self-evaluation. By providing a metacognitive framework for self-evaluation, we can guide LLMs to more thoroughly and consistently assess their own uncertainty across diverse queries. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where individuals engage in structured self-reflection to gauge their confidence and identify potential sources of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Scaffolding for Uncertainty Quantification (MSUQ), a prompting technique that guides the LLM through a structured self-evaluation process: 1) Prompt the model to identify the type of knowledge or reasoning required for the query. 2) Guide the model to assess its familiarity and expertise in the relevant domain. 3) Ask the model to outline potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., ambiguity in the query, conflicting information, lack of specific knowledge). 4) Prompt the model to estimate its confidence for different aspects of the query separately. 5) Guide the model to synthesize these assessments into a final calibrated confidence score. Each step uses carefully designed prompts to encourage thorough metacognitive reasoning.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks and knowledge domains to evaluate MSUQ: a) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for general knowledge, b) TruthfulQA for assessing model honesty, and c) SciQ for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, allowing us to test the robustness of our method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct confidence estimation: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings during generation and calibrate the output probabilities. c) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use multiple model runs or different model checkpoints to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: MSUQ Implementation": "Implement the MSUQ method with the following steps: a) Knowledge type identification: 'What type of knowledge or reasoning is required to answer this question?' b) Expertise assessment: 'On a scale of 1-10, how familiar are you with this topic? Explain your rating.' c) Uncertainty source identification: 'What are potential sources of uncertainty in answering this question?' d) Aspect-wise confidence estimation: 'For each key aspect of the question, provide a confidence score and explanation.' e) Final calibration: 'Based on your previous assessments, what is your overall confidence in your answer? Provide a score and justification.'",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and MSUQ): a) Generate answers and confidence estimates for all questions. b) For MSUQ, record intermediate outputs for each step of the process. c) Use GPT-4 as the primary model, with GPT-3.5 and Claude 2 as secondary models for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "a) Calculate calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). b) Compute Brier score to assess probabilistic forecast accuracy. c) Analyze the correlation between confidence estimates and answer correctness. d) Evaluate the consistency of uncertainty quantification across different domains and question types.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Compare MSUQ performance against baselines across different datasets and models. b) Analyze the intermediate outputs of MSUQ to understand how each step contributes to the final confidence estimate. c) Identify patterns in how the model assesses its own knowledge and uncertainty across different domains. d) Examine cases where MSUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please follow these steps to answer:\n1. Identify the type of knowledge required.\n2. Assess your familiarity with the topic (1-10).\n3. List potential sources of uncertainty.\n4. Estimate your confidence for key aspects.\n5. Provide a final calibrated confidence score (0-100) with justification.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Knowledge type: This question requires basic geographical knowledge about countries and their capitals.\n2. Familiarity: 9/10. I am very familiar with basic geography and European capitals.\n3. Potential uncertainties: \n   - Possible recent changes in capital cities (very unlikely)\n   - Confusion with other major French cities\n4. Aspect-wise confidence:\n   - Identifying France as a country: 100%\n   - Knowing Paris is a major city in France: 100%\n   - Paris being the current capital: 98%\n5. Final calibrated confidence: 98\nJustification: I am highly confident that Paris is the capital of France. This is a widely known fact that I have encountered numerous times. The slight reduction from 100% confidence accounts for the extremely small possibility of very recent, unaccounted changes or errors in my knowledge base.",
            "Explanation": "The MSUQ method provides a more detailed and nuanced assessment of the model's confidence. It breaks down the reasoning process, considers potential sources of uncertainty, and provides justification for the final confidence score. This structured approach is likely to result in better-calibrated confidence estimates compared to the simple baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MSUQ does not significantly improve calibration metrics compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the intermediate steps in MSUQ to understand which components are most effective and why the overall method might be underperforming. This could lead to insights about the model's metacognitive abilities and limitations. 2) Explore variations of MSUQ, such as changing the order of steps or adding/removing certain components, to see if a modified version performs better. 3) Investigate how MSUQ performs across different types of questions and knowledge domains. It may be more effective in certain areas, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Compare MSUQ outputs across different LLMs to analyze how model size or training approach affects metacognitive abilities. 5) Combine MSUQ with other uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., ensemble methods) to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple techniques."
