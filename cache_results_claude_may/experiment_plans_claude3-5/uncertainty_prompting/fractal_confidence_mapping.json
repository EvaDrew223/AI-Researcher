    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Existing confidence calibration methods often struggle with capturing hierarchical and self-similar patterns in model uncertainty across different scales of language understanding.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on flat, single-scale confidence estimates or simple hierarchical decompositions.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from fractal geometry in nature, we posit that model uncertainty exhibits self-similar patterns at different linguistic scales, from word-level to document-level understanding.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Fractal Confidence Mapping (FCM), a novel prompting technique that recursively probes model confidence at multiple linguistic scales. The method involves: 1) Starting with a high-level confidence estimate for the entire task. 2) Recursively decomposing the task into smaller linguistic units (e.g., paragraphs, sentences, phrases) and estimating confidence for each. 3) Aggregating these multi-scale confidence estimates using fractal dimension analysis to produce a rich, scale-invariant uncertainty representation. This approach captures both local and global uncertainty patterns, revealing intricate confidence structures.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare FCM with standard confidence estimation techniques on tasks requiring multi-scale understanding, such as long document summarization and hierarchical text classification. Evaluate the method's ability to capture fine-grained uncertainty patterns and its correlation with human judgments of confidence at different linguistic scales."

        "Title": "Fractal Confidence Mapping: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Scale Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing confidence calibration methods for large language models often struggle to capture hierarchical and self-similar patterns in model uncertainty across different scales of language understanding. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret model confidence, particularly in complex tasks requiring multi-scale comprehension.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in language models typically focus on flat, single-scale confidence estimates or simple hierarchical decompositions. These methods fail to capture the intricate, self-similar nature of language understanding that occurs at multiple scales. Drawing inspiration from fractal geometry in nature, we posit that model uncertainty exhibits self-similar patterns at different linguistic scales, from word-level to document-level understanding. By developing a method that can capture these multi-scale uncertainty patterns, we aim to provide a more nuanced and accurate representation of model confidence, which could significantly improve model interpretability and reliability in various NLP tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Fractal Confidence Mapping (FCM), a novel prompting technique that recursively probes model confidence at multiple linguistic scales. The method involves three main steps: 1) Starting with a high-level confidence estimate for the entire task. 2) Recursively decomposing the task into smaller linguistic units (e.g., paragraphs, sentences, phrases) and estimating confidence for each. 3) Aggregating these multi-scale confidence estimates using fractal dimension analysis to produce a rich, scale-invariant uncertainty representation. This approach captures both local and global uncertainty patterns, revealing intricate confidence structures.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets that require multi-scale understanding: 1) CNN/Daily Mail dataset for long document summarization, and 2) GLUE's MNLI dataset for hierarchical text classification. For each dataset, we'll randomly sample 1000 examples for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline confidence estimation methods: 1) Direct prompting: Ask the model to provide a single confidence score for the entire task. 2) Hierarchical decomposition: Break down the task into major components and estimate confidence for each.",
            "Step 3: FCM Implementation": "Implement the Fractal Confidence Mapping method: a) High-level confidence: Prompt the model to provide an overall confidence score. b) Recursive decomposition: Break down the input into progressively smaller linguistic units (documents -> paragraphs -> sentences -> phrases -> words) and estimate confidence for each. c) Fractal aggregation: Use box-counting method to compute the fractal dimension of the confidence landscape.",
            "Step 4: Prompting Design": "Design prompts for each step of FCM. For example: 'Given the following text, provide your confidence (0-100) in summarizing it: [TEXT]' for high-level confidence, and 'For the following sentence, rate your confidence (0-100) in understanding its meaning: [SENTENCE]' for sentence-level confidence.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments, as it has demonstrated strong performance in multi-scale language understanding tasks.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each example in our datasets: a) Apply the baseline methods and record their confidence estimates. b) Apply FCM and record the multi-scale confidence estimates and the computed fractal dimension. c) Generate the model's output (summary or classification) for the task.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3 NLP experts to rate the quality of the model's outputs and provide their own confidence estimates at different scales. This will serve as a ground truth for evaluating our method.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "a) Compare FCM's performance against baselines using metrics such as Brier score and calibration plots. b) Analyze the correlation between FCM's fractal dimension and human judgments of task difficulty. c) Visualize the multi-scale confidence patterns using heatmaps or 3D plots to reveal self-similar structures."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Summarize the following news article and provide your confidence (0-100) in your summary: [FULL NEWS ARTICLE]",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "[SUMMARY]\nConfidence: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FCM; Step 1: High-level Confidence)": "You will be asked to summarize the following news article. Before doing so, provide your overall confidence (0-100) in your ability to accurately summarize this article: [FULL NEWS ARTICLE]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FCM; Step 1: High-level Confidence)": "Overall Confidence: 82",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FCM; Step 2: Paragraph-level Confidence)": "For each paragraph in the news article, rate your confidence (0-100) in understanding and summarizing its content: [PARAGRAPH 1] ... [PARAGRAPH N]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FCM; Step 2: Paragraph-level Confidence)": "Paragraph 1 Confidence: 90\nParagraph 2 Confidence: 85\nParagraph 3 Confidence: 75\n...\nParagraph N Confidence: 80",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (FCM; Step 3: Sentence-level Confidence)": "For each sentence in the following paragraph, rate your confidence (0-100) in understanding its meaning: [SENTENCE 1] ... [SENTENCE M]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (FCM; Step 3: Sentence-level Confidence)": "Sentence 1 Confidence: 95\nSentence 2 Confidence: 88\nSentence 3 Confidence: 92\n...\nSentence M Confidence: 85",
            "Explanation": "FCM provides a more detailed and nuanced confidence assessment compared to the baseline method. It captures confidence variations at different scales, revealing areas of high and low confidence within the document. This multi-scale approach allows for a more accurate representation of the model's uncertainty, potentially leading to better-calibrated and more reliable outputs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If FCM does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate whether certain types of tasks or linguistic structures benefit more from multi-scale confidence estimation. Additionally, we could explore alternative aggregation methods beyond fractal dimension analysis, such as wavelet transforms or multi-scale entropy measures. Another direction could be to use FCM's detailed confidence maps to identify specific areas where the model struggles, turning this into an analysis paper on model behavior across different linguistic scales. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of large language models in processing complex, multi-scale language tasks."
