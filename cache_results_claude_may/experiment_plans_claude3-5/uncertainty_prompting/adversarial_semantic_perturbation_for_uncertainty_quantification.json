        "Problem": "Language models often display false certainty when faced with inputs that are semantically similar to their training data but contain subtle differences that should increase uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current uncertainty estimation methods typically don't explicitly test model robustness to semantic perturbations.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically introducing semantic perturbations and observing how they affect model outputs and confidence, we can probe the boundaries of model certainty and identify potential vulnerabilities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Semantic Perturbation for Uncertainty Quantification (ASPUQ): 1) Given an input query, prompt the model to generate a set of semantically similar but subtly altered versions (e.g., changing key terms, altering context). 2) For each perturbed version, prompt the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 3) Prompt the model to analyze how its answers and confidence change across perturbations, identifying which alterations cause the most uncertainty. 4) Finally, prompt the model to synthesize these observations into an overall uncertainty assessment, explaining how sensitive its certainty is to small semantic changes.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test ASPUQ on a variety of NLP tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification. Compare against baseline uncertainty methods in terms of identifying inputs near the decision boundary and providing informative explanations of model uncertainty in borderline cases."

        "Title": "Adversarial Semantic Perturbation for Uncertainty Quantification (ASPUQ): Probing the Boundaries of Language Model Certainty",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often display false certainty when faced with inputs that are semantically similar to their training data but contain subtle differences that should increase uncertainty. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misuse of AI systems in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current uncertainty estimation methods typically don't explicitly test model robustness to semantic perturbations. By systematically introducing semantic perturbations and observing how they affect model outputs and confidence, we can probe the boundaries of model certainty and identify potential vulnerabilities. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to generate perturbations and analyze its responses, potentially offering a more nuanced and context-aware method of uncertainty quantification compared to existing techniques.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Semantic Perturbation for Uncertainty Quantification (ASPUQ), a multi-step prompting approach: 1) Given an input query, prompt the model to generate a set of semantically similar but subtly altered versions. 2) For each perturbed version, prompt the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 3) Prompt the model to analyze how its answers and confidence change across perturbations, identifying which alterations cause the most uncertainty. 4) Finally, prompt the model to synthesize these observations into an overall uncertainty assessment, explaining how sensitive its certainty is to small semantic changes.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse NLP tasks for evaluation: a) Question Answering: SQuAD 2.0, b) Sentiment Analysis: SST-2, c) Text Classification: AG News. For each dataset, randomly sample 100 examples for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: a) Softmax probability, b) Monte Carlo Dropout, c) Ensemble of models. Use GPT-3.5-turbo for all experiments.",
            "Step 3: ASPUQ Implementation": "Implement the ASPUQ method using the following prompts for each step: a) Perturbation Generation: \"Generate 5 semantically similar versions of the following input, introducing subtle changes that might affect the answer or confidence: [INPUT]\", b) Answer and Confidence: \"Provide an answer and confidence score (0-100) for the following question: [PERTURBED_INPUT]\", c) Perturbation Analysis: \"Analyze how the answers and confidence scores changed across the following perturbations. Identify which changes caused the most uncertainty: [LIST_OF_PERTURBATIONS_AND_RESPONSES]\", d) Uncertainty Synthesis: \"Based on the perturbation analysis, provide an overall assessment of the model's uncertainty for the original input. Explain how sensitive the model's certainty is to small semantic changes.\"",
            "Step 4: Evaluation": "For each example in the evaluation sets: a) Apply baseline methods and record uncertainty estimates. b) Apply ASPUQ method and record the final uncertainty assessment. c) Have human annotators rate the quality and informativeness of the uncertainty assessments on a scale of 1-5.",
            "Step 5: Analysis": "a) Compare the correlation between baseline uncertainty estimates and human-rated quality scores. b) Compare the correlation between ASPUQ uncertainty assessments and human-rated quality scores. c) Analyze cases where ASPUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. d) Examine the types of semantic perturbations that most effectively reveal model uncertainty."

            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Softmax Probability Output": "Paris (Confidence: 0.98)",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score but doesn't capture potential uncertainties or nuances."
            },
            "ASPUQ Method Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 1 - Perturbation Generation": [
                    "1. What's the administrative center of France?",
                    "2. Which city houses the French government?",
                    "3. What was the capital of France in 1789?",
                    "4. What is the most populous city in France?",
                    "5. What is the capital city of the French Republic?"
                ],
                "Step 2 - Answer and Confidence": [
                    "1. Paris (Confidence: 95)",
                    "2. Paris (Confidence: 98)",
                    "3. Paris (Confidence: 80)",
                    "4. Paris (Confidence: 90)",
                    "5. Paris (Confidence: 99)"
                ],
                "Step 3 - Perturbation Analysis": "The model's confidence remains high for most perturbations, but drops slightly for the historical question (1789) and the population-based question. This suggests some sensitivity to temporal context and potential confusion with other significant French cities.",
                "Step 4 - Uncertainty Synthesis": "The model displays high overall certainty that Paris is the capital of France, with confidence scores mostly above 90%. However, the introduction of historical context or alternative city attributes (like population) slightly reduces confidence. This suggests that while the model is very certain about the current capital, it shows appropriate uncertainty when faced with questions that could have different answers in other contexts. The model's certainty is most sensitive to changes in temporal framing and least sensitive to variations in phrasing of the current political status.",
                "Explanation": "ASPUQ provides a more nuanced assessment of the model's uncertainty, revealing potential areas of confusion and the types of contextual changes that affect the model's confidence."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ASPUQ doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods in terms of correlation with human-rated quality scores, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the patterns of semantic perturbations that most effectively reveal model uncertainties. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the types of contextual changes that challenge language models, even if they don't directly translate to better uncertainty quantification. We could categorize the perturbations (e.g., temporal shifts, rephrasing, introducing ambiguity) and analyze how different types of changes affect model confidence across various tasks. This could lead to a paper on 'Probing Language Model Robustness through Semantic Perturbations' which, while not achieving the original goal of improved uncertainty quantification, would still offer valuable insights into language model behavior and potential vulnerabilities."
