        "Problem": "Large language models often provide overly simplistic uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the multi-faceted nature of uncertainty across different levels of abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on generating a single uncertainty score, which may not adequately represent the complex interplay of uncertainties at different scales.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from multi-scale analysis in signal processing and hierarchical modeling in statistics, we propose a method that decomposes uncertainty across multiple scales of abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Scale Uncertainty Decomposition (MSUD), a prompting technique that guides the model to generate and combine uncertainty estimates at multiple levels of abstraction. The method involves: 1) Defining a hierarchy of abstraction levels relevant to the task (e.g., word-level, sentence-level, paragraph-level, conceptual-level). 2) Prompting the model to generate uncertainty estimates at each level of abstraction. 3) Guiding the model to explain the relationships and dependencies between uncertainties at different levels. 4) Aggregating the multi-level uncertainties into a comprehensive uncertainty profile. 5) Iteratively refining the estimates and explanations to ensure consistency across levels. 6) Generating a final uncertainty score that weights the contributions from different scales based on their relevance to the task.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MSUD against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on tasks that involve multiple levels of understanding, such as complex document analysis or multi-step reasoning problems. Evaluate using metrics like hierarchical calibration error, uncertainty profile diversity, and novel metrics designed to measure the coherence and informativeness of the multi-scale decomposition."

        "Title": "Multi-Scale Uncertainty Decomposition: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide overly simplistic uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the multi-faceted nature of uncertainty across different levels of abstraction. This limitation hinders the models' ability to accurately represent their confidence in complex tasks, potentially leading to unreliable outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on generating a single uncertainty score, which may not adequately represent the complex interplay of uncertainties at different scales. Drawing inspiration from multi-scale analysis in signal processing and hierarchical modeling in statistics, we propose a method that decomposes uncertainty across multiple scales of abstraction. This approach aims to provide a more nuanced and comprehensive representation of model uncertainty, potentially improving the reliability and interpretability of language model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Scale Uncertainty Decomposition (MSUD), a prompting technique that guides the model to generate and combine uncertainty estimates at multiple levels of abstraction. The method involves: 1) Defining a hierarchy of abstraction levels relevant to the task (e.g., word-level, sentence-level, paragraph-level, conceptual-level). 2) Prompting the model to generate uncertainty estimates at each level of abstraction. 3) Guiding the model to explain the relationships and dependencies between uncertainties at different levels. 4) Aggregating the multi-level uncertainties into a comprehensive uncertainty profile. 5) Iteratively refining the estimates and explanations to ensure consistency across levels. 6) Generating a final uncertainty score that weights the contributions from different scales based on their relevance to the task.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets for evaluation: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) LAMBADA for language modeling and contextual understanding, and 3) MultiNLI for natural language inference. These datasets cover a range of tasks that require different levels of abstraction and reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: 1) Softmax probabilities, 2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs for these baselines.",
            "Step 3: MSUD Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the MSUD method. For example:\n1) Abstraction levels prompt: 'Identify the following levels of abstraction in the given task: word-level, sentence-level, paragraph-level, and conceptual-level.'\n2) Uncertainty estimation prompt: 'For each level of abstraction, provide an uncertainty estimate between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely certain and 1 is completely uncertain.'\n3) Relationship explanation prompt: 'Explain how the uncertainties at different levels relate to and influence each other.'\n4) Aggregation prompt: 'Combine the multi-level uncertainties into a comprehensive uncertainty profile.'\n5) Refinement prompt: 'Review and refine the uncertainty estimates to ensure consistency across levels.'\n6) Final score prompt: 'Generate a final uncertainty score that weights the contributions from different scales based on their relevance to the task.'",
            "Step 4: MSUD Implementation": "Implement the MSUD method using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs. Create a pipeline that sequentially applies each prompt and processes the model's responses.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), 2) Uncertainty profile diversity (e.g., entropy of uncertainty distributions across levels), 3) Correlation between uncertainty and error rates, 4) Human evaluation of explanation quality and coherence.",
            "Step 6: Experiments": "Run experiments comparing MSUD against baselines on all datasets. For each dataset and model combination: 1) Generate predictions and uncertainty estimates using baselines and MSUD. 2) Calculate evaluation metrics. 3) Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare MSUD with baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: 1) Compare performance across different abstraction levels. 2) Analyze how uncertainties propagate and interact across levels. 3) Identify patterns in cases where MSUD outperforms or underperforms baselines. 4) Examine the quality and coherence of explanations generated by MSUD."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nA: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.\nHow certain are you about this answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "I am 95% certain about this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nA: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.\nProvide uncertainty estimates at multiple levels of abstraction (word-level, sentence-level, and conceptual-level) and explain the relationships between these uncertainties.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Word-level uncertainty: 0.05 (Very low uncertainty for specific names and dates)\nSentence-level uncertainty: 0.1 (Low uncertainty for the overall statement)\nConceptual-level uncertainty: 0.2 (Slightly higher uncertainty about the broader historical context)\n\nRelationships between uncertainties:\nThe word-level uncertainty is very low because the specific names (Neil Armstrong) and dates (July 20, 1969) are well-known facts that I'm highly confident about. This low word-level uncertainty contributes to the low sentence-level uncertainty, as the sentence is composed of these highly certain elements.\n\nThe sentence-level uncertainty is slightly higher than the word-level because it involves combining these individual facts into a coherent statement. There's a small chance that I might have misremembered or misconnected some of these facts, although this chance is quite low.\n\nThe conceptual-level uncertainty is the highest (although still relatively low) because it involves understanding the broader historical context of the moon landing. While I'm very confident about the specific event, there might be some uncertainty about its place in the larger context of space exploration history or its implications.\n\nOverall uncertainty profile:\nThe uncertainty increases slightly as we move from specific details to broader concepts, but remains low across all levels due to the well-documented nature of this historical event.\n\nFinal weighted uncertainty score: 0.12\n\nThis final score weighs the sentence-level uncertainty most heavily as it best represents the overall certainty of the answer, while also considering the very low word-level uncertainty and slightly higher conceptual-level uncertainty.",
            "explanation": "The MSUD method provides a more nuanced and detailed uncertainty estimate compared to the baseline. It breaks down the uncertainty across different levels of abstraction, explains the relationships between these uncertainties, and provides a final weighted score. This approach offers more insight into the model's confidence and the sources of any uncertainty, which could be more informative and reliable than a single uncertainty score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MSUD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why MSUD fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in representing multi-scale uncertainties. 2) Explore different ways of aggregating multi-scale uncertainties, such as using the model itself to learn an optimal aggregation strategy. 3) Investigate how MSUD performs on different types of tasks or domains, which could reveal task-specific patterns in uncertainty representation. 4) Analyze the generated explanations to understand how LLMs reason about their own uncertainties, potentially uncovering interesting cognitive patterns. 5) Combine MSUD with other uncertainty estimation techniques (e.g., ensemble methods) to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. These alternative directions could still result in valuable contributions to the field of uncertainty estimation in LLMs."
