        "Problem": "LLMs often give inconsistent answers and confidence levels when asked similar questions at different times or in different contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most confidence estimation approaches consider only a single interaction, ignoring potential temporal inconsistencies.",
        "Motivation": "By examining an LLM's responses and confidence levels across time and varying contexts, we can better quantify its true uncertainty and identify areas of inconsistency.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a prompting strategy that assesses temporal consistency to quantify uncertainty. First, we ask the model a series of related questions spaced out over the course of a long conversation, interspersed with unrelated topics. We then prompt the model to compare its answers and confidence levels across these temporally separated instances, asking it to identify and explain any inconsistencies. Finally, we guide the model to synthesize this analysis into a more robust uncertainty estimate that accounts for its own temporal inconsistency. This process can be repeated with varying contexts and phrasings to build a comprehensive picture of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on a test set of questions asked multiple times in different contexts. Compare the resulting uncertainty estimates to those from single-shot confidence elicitation in terms of calibration, consistency, and correlation with actual model performance variability."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Prompting for Robust Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inconsistent answers and confidence levels when asked similar questions at different times or in varying contexts. This inconsistency makes it challenging to accurately quantify the model's true uncertainty, which is crucial for reliable decision-making in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing confidence estimation methods typically focus on single interactions, neglecting the potential temporal inconsistencies in LLM responses. By examining an LLM's answers and confidence levels across time and varying contexts, we can better quantify its true uncertainty and identify areas of inconsistency. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to analyze its responses over time, potentially leading to more robust uncertainty estimates without requiring additional training or external models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a Temporal Consistency Prompting (TCP) strategy to quantify uncertainty in LLMs. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Temporal Sampling: Ask the model a series of related questions spaced out over the course of a long conversation, interspersed with unrelated topics. 2) Self-Analysis: Prompt the model to compare its answers and confidence levels across these temporally separated instances, asking it to identify and explain any inconsistencies. 3) Uncertainty Synthesis: Guide the model to synthesize this analysis into a more robust uncertainty estimate that accounts for its own temporal inconsistency. This process can be repeated with varying contexts and phrasings to build a comprehensive picture of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a test set of 100 questions from diverse domains (e.g., science, history, current events). For each question, prepare 5 paraphrased versions to test consistency across different phrasings.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Elicitation": "For each question, use standard prompting to get an answer and confidence score (e.g., \"Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]\"). Store these results as the baseline.",
            "Step 3: Temporal Consistency Prompting": "For each original question: a) Start a conversation with the LLM. b) Ask the original question and its paraphrases at random intervals, interspersed with 5-10 unrelated questions or statements. c) After asking all versions, prompt the LLM to analyze its answers: \"You've answered versions of the same question multiple times. Please compare your answers and confidence levels, identifying any inconsistencies.\" d) Then prompt: \"Based on your analysis, provide a final answer and a revised confidence score that accounts for any inconsistencies you found.\" e) Store the final answer, revised confidence score, and the LLM's analysis.",
            "Step 4: Context Variation": "Repeat Step 3, but vary the context by providing different background information before asking each version of the question. Store these results separately.",
            "Step 5: Uncertainty Synthesis": "For each question, prompt the LLM to synthesize its analyses from Steps 3 and 4: \"Given your analyses of answering this question across time and in different contexts, provide a final uncertainty estimate. Explain how temporal consistency and context sensitivity influenced your estimate.\"",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of TCP against the baseline method using the following metrics: a) Calibration: Calculate the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for both methods. b) Consistency: Measure the standard deviation of confidence scores across different phrasings and contexts. c) Correlation: Calculate the correlation between confidence scores and actual performance (e.g., accuracy) for both methods.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3 domain experts to rate the quality and informativeness of the uncertainty estimates produced by both methods for a subset of 20 questions.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the results to determine if TCP produces more reliable and informative uncertainty estimates compared to the baseline. Identify patterns in types of questions or domains where TCP shows the most improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Roald Amundsen was the first person to reach the South Pole on December 14, 1911. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Temporal Sampling)": "[After several unrelated exchanges] Who was the first explorer to reach the South Pole? [Later in the conversation] Which Norwegian led the first successful expedition to the South Pole? [Even later] In the race to the South Pole, who arrived first?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Temporal Sampling)": "1. Roald Amundsen was the first explorer to reach the South Pole on December 14, 1911. Confidence: 95\n2. Roald Amundsen led the first successful expedition to the South Pole. Confidence: 98\n3. In the race to the South Pole, Roald Amundsen arrived first, beating Robert Falcon Scott by about a month. Confidence: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Self-Analysis)": "You've answered versions of the same question about the first person to reach the South Pole multiple times. Please compare your answers and confidence levels, identifying any inconsistencies.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Self-Analysis)": "Analyzing my responses, I consistently identified Roald Amundsen as the first person to reach the South Pole. However, I notice some inconsistencies in my confidence levels, ranging from 90 to 98. The variation might be due to slight differences in the questions' phrasing or my recall at different points in the conversation. I also added more detail in some answers, mentioning the specific date (December 14, 1911) and the competition with Robert Falcon Scott, which might have affected my perceived confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on your analysis of answering this question across time and in different contexts, provide a final uncertainty estimate. Explain how temporal consistency and context sensitivity influenced your estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Roald Amundsen was the first person to reach the South Pole on December 14, 1911.\nUncertainty Estimate: 7% (93% confident)\nExplanation: The temporal consistency in identifying Roald Amundsen across multiple phrasings of the question increases my confidence. However, the variation in my initial confidence scores (90-98) and the inconsistency in providing additional details (like the exact date and the competition with Scott) slightly increases the uncertainty. The core fact remained consistent, but the fluctuation in peripheral details suggests some uncertainty. The 7% uncertainty accounts for potential minor inaccuracies in the exact date or details of the expedition, while maintaining high confidence in Amundsen being the first to reach the South Pole."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to the baseline, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why TCP failed to improve estimates. This could involve categorizing types of questions where TCP performed poorly and analyzing the model's self-analysis process. 2) Explore variations of the TCP method, such as increasing the time gap between questions or varying the number of paraphrases used. 3) Investigate how different prompting strategies for the self-analysis and synthesis steps affect the final uncertainty estimates. 4) Compare TCP with other uncertainty quantification methods like ensemble approaches or calibration techniques. 5) Analyze how TCP performs across different model sizes or architectures to gain insights into how model capacity affects temporal consistency in uncertainty estimation. These analyses could lead to valuable insights about LLM behavior and limitations in uncertainty estimation, potentially informing future research directions in this area."
