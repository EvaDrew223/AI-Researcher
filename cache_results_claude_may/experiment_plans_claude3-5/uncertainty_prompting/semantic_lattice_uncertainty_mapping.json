        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods often fail to capture the hierarchical and interconnected nature of knowledge, leading to inconsistent uncertainty estimates across related concepts.",

        "Title": "Semantic Lattice Uncertainty Mapping: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture the hierarchical and interconnected nature of knowledge, leading to inconsistent uncertainty estimates across related concepts. This inconsistency can result in unreliable confidence assessments, particularly in complex reasoning tasks or when dealing with interdependent information.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically treat each query independently, missing opportunities to leverage semantic relationships between concepts. Knowledge is often structured in hierarchical or lattice-like relationships. By mapping uncertainties across this semantic structure, we can achieve more consistent and interpretable uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where confidence in one piece of information often influences confidence in related concepts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Lattice Uncertainty Mapping (SLUM), a novel method for uncertainty quantification in large language models. The process involves five key steps: 1) Given a query, use the LLM to generate a local semantic lattice of related concepts. 2) For each node in the lattice, generate a confidence estimate using standard techniques. 3) Propagate uncertainties through the lattice using belief propagation algorithms, ensuring consistency across related concepts. 4) Use the resulting uncertainty-annotated lattice to generate a final response and confidence estimate for the original query. 5) Optionally, present the uncertainty-annotated lattice alongside the response for interpretability.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) A subset of the TruthfulQA dataset for open-ended question answering, and 2) A subset of the GLUE diagnostic dataset for natural language inference tasks. These datasets cover a range of topics and reasoning types, allowing us to test SLUM's performance across diverse scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty quantification methods: 1) Monte Carlo Dropout, and 2) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation. These will serve as our comparison points for SLUM.",
            "Step 3: SLUM Implementation": "Implement the SLUM method as follows: a) Semantic Lattice Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a semantic lattice of related concepts for each query. Use a prompt like 'Generate a hierarchical structure of concepts related to [QUERY]. Include broader categories, specific examples, and related ideas.' b) Node-level Uncertainty Estimation: For each node in the lattice, generate a confidence estimate using the baseline methods. c) Uncertainty Propagation: Implement a belief propagation algorithm to propagate uncertainties through the lattice. d) Final Response Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a final response and confidence estimate based on the uncertainty-annotated lattice.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration Error: Measure how well the predicted probabilities of correctness match the empirical probabilities. 2) Hierarchical Calibration Error: A novel metric that measures calibration consistency across related concepts in the semantic lattice. 3) Uncertainty-Weighted Accuracy: Evaluate the model's ability to abstain on uncertain predictions. 4) Interpretability Score: A human evaluation of the usefulness of the presented uncertainty-annotated lattice.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and SLUM): a) Generate predictions and uncertainty estimates for all test samples. b) Calculate all evaluation metrics. c) Perform statistical significance tests to compare SLUM against the baselines.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of SLUM vs baselines across all metrics. b) Investigation of cases where SLUM significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. c) Analysis of the generated semantic lattices and their impact on uncertainty estimates. d) Examination of the propagation of uncertainties through the lattice structure."

            "Proposed Prompt Input (SLUM Step 4: Final Response)": "Based on the uncertainty-annotated lattice, provide a final answer to the question 'What is the capital of France?' along with a confidence estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SLUM Step 4: Final Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.95)\n\nThis high confidence is supported by multiple nodes in our semantic lattice, including 'Paris as the capital' (0.95), 'Paris' under major cities (0.95), and 'Paris (France)' under Western European capitals (0.95). The consistency of high confidence across related concepts in the lattice reinforces our certainty in this answer.",
            "Explanation": "SLUM provides a more robust and interpretable uncertainty estimate by considering the semantic relationships between concepts. While the final confidence score may be similar to the baseline, SLUM offers additional context and justification for its uncertainty estimate, potentially leading to more reliable and consistent uncertainty quantification across related queries."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SLUM does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality and relevance of the generated semantic lattices. Are they capturing meaningful relationships? 2) The effectiveness of the uncertainty propagation algorithm. Is it accurately reflecting the interdependencies between concepts? 3) The impact of different types of queries on SLUM's performance. Are there specific categories of questions where SLUM excels or struggles? This analysis could lead to insights about the strengths and limitations of semantic structure-based approaches to uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we could explore variations of SLUM, such as using different methods for lattice generation or alternative propagation algorithms. Finally, we could investigate the potential of SLUM as a complementary method to existing techniques, possibly leading to a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of multiple uncertainty quantification methods."
