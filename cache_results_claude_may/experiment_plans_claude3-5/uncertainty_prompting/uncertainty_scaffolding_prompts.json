    "idea_name": "Uncertainty Scaffolding Prompts",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in their outputs, leading to overconfident assertions even when the model's knowledge is limited or ambiguous.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like direct prompting for confidence scores or using model logits have shown limited success in calibrating model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often build up their confidence assessments gradually by considering multiple aspects of a problem. By guiding LLMs through a similar scaffolded process, we may be able to elicit more nuanced and calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Scaffolding Prompts (USP), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model through increasingly specific uncertainty assessments. The process involves: 1) Asking the model to identify potential sources of uncertainty related to the query. 2) Prompting for a qualitative assessment of confidence levels for each identified source. 3) Requesting numerical confidence estimates for each source. 4) Guiding the model to synthesize these individual assessments into an overall uncertainty estimate. 5) Finally, prompting the model to express its answer and uncertainty in natural language, integrating all previous steps.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare USP against standard prompting, direct confidence elicitation, and ensemble methods on various question-answering datasets. Evaluate using calibration metrics like Brier score and ECE, as well as the quality and interpretability of uncertainty explanations as judged by human raters."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Scaffolding Prompts: Eliciting Calibrated Confidence Estimates from Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in their outputs, leading to overconfident assertions even when the model's knowledge is limited or ambiguous. This can result in unreliable or misleading information being presented as factual, potentially causing issues in critical applications that rely on LLM outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like direct prompting for confidence scores or using model logits have shown limited success in calibrating model uncertainty. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty across different aspects of a problem. Humans, on the other hand, build up their confidence assessments gradually by considering multiple facets of a question. By guiding LLMs through a similar scaffolded process, we may be able to elicit more nuanced and calibrated uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to break down the problem and assess confidence at a finer granularity, potentially leading to more accurate overall uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Scaffolding Prompts (USP), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the model through increasingly specific uncertainty assessments. The process involves five key steps: 1) Asking the model to identify potential sources of uncertainty related to the query. 2) Prompting for a qualitative assessment of confidence levels for each identified source. 3) Requesting numerical confidence estimates for each source. 4) Guiding the model to synthesize these individual assessments into an overall uncertainty estimate. 5) Finally, prompting the model to express its answer and uncertainty in natural language, integrating all previous steps.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, and 3) StrategyQA for multi-hop reasoning. These datasets cover a range of question types and difficulty levels, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of USP across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Direct confidence elicitation (asking the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer), and c) Ensemble method (using multiple model runs to estimate uncertainty).",
            "Step 3: USP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Scaffolding Prompts method with the following steps for each query: a) Source identification prompt: 'What are the potential sources of uncertainty in answering this question?' b) Qualitative assessment prompt: 'For each identified source of uncertainty, provide a qualitative assessment of your confidence level (low, medium, high).' c) Numerical estimation prompt: 'Now, assign a numerical confidence score (0-100%) for each source of uncertainty.' d) Synthesis prompt: 'Based on these individual assessments, what is your overall confidence in answering the original question?' e) Final answer prompt: 'Provide your final answer to the original question, incorporating your uncertainty assessment.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance: a) Calibration error: measured using Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). b) Brier score: to assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): to evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds. d) Human evaluation: to assess the quality and interpretability of uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect results. b) Run the USP method and collect results. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and USP methods. d) Conduct human evaluation on a subset of responses to assess explanation quality.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of USP against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze how USP performs across different question types and difficulty levels. c) Examine the correlation between identified sources of uncertainty and actual model performance. d) Investigate how the granularity of uncertainty assessment in USP affects overall calibration."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first people to reach the summit of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USP Step 1)": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest? What are the potential sources of uncertainty in answering this question?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USP Step 1)": "Potential sources of uncertainty:\n1. Historical records: The accuracy and completeness of early mountaineering records.\n2. Definition of 'first': Whether we consider only officially recognized expeditions or potential earlier, undocumented attempts.\n3. Joint achievement: The question asks for a single person, but it was a team effort.\n4. Conflicting claims: There have been some disputed claims about earlier summits.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USP Step 2)": "For each identified source of uncertainty, provide a qualitative assessment of your confidence level (low, medium, high).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USP Step 2)": "1. Historical records: High confidence\n2. Definition of 'first': Medium confidence\n3. Joint achievement: High confidence\n4. Conflicting claims: Medium confidence",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USP Step 3)": "Now, assign a numerical confidence score (0-100%) for each source of uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USP Step 3)": "1. Historical records: 90%\n2. Definition of 'first': 70%\n3. Joint achievement: 95%\n4. Conflicting claims: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USP Step 4)": "Based on these individual assessments, what is your overall confidence in answering the original question?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USP Step 4)": "Given the individual assessments, my overall confidence in answering the original question is approximately 85%. This takes into account the high confidence in historical records and the joint achievement aspect, balanced against the medium confidence in the definition of 'first' and the existence of some conflicting claims.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (USP Step 5)": "Provide your final answer to the original question, incorporating your uncertainty assessment.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USP Step 5)": "With about 85% confidence, I can say that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first people to reach the summit of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953. However, it's important to note that this answer comes with some caveats: while the historical record is generally clear, there is some uncertainty around the definition of 'first' (considering only official expeditions) and there have been some disputed claims of earlier summits. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that this was a joint achievement, even though the question asks for a single person.",
            "Explanation": "The USP method provides a more nuanced and calibrated response compared to the baseline. It identifies specific sources of uncertainty, quantifies them, and incorporates this assessment into the final answer. This approach allows for a more transparent and potentially more accurate expression of the model's confidence in its response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed USP method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine each step of the USP process to identify where it might be falling short. For instance, we could analyze whether the identified sources of uncertainty are relevant and comprehensive, whether the qualitative and quantitative assessments are consistent and meaningful, and how well the model synthesizes these assessments. We could also investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from USP than others. Additionally, we might explore variations of the USP method, such as changing the order of steps, using different prompting strategies for each step, or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide the uncertainty assessment. This analysis could provide valuable insights into how LLMs reason about uncertainty and inform the development of improved methods for uncertainty quantification."
