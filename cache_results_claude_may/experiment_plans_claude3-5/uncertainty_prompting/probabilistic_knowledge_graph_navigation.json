        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when reasoning over complex networks of facts and relationships, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates in knowledge-intensive tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically treat knowledge as a flat structure or use simple hierarchical representations for confidence estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the LLM to construct and navigate a probabilistic knowledge graph, we can better capture the interconnected nature of information and provide more accurate, structure-aware uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Navigation (PKGN), a method that guides the LLM to build and traverse a probabilistic knowledge graph relevant to the query. Initially, we prompt the LLM to identify key concepts and their relationships, assigning confidence scores to each node and edge. We then guide the LLM through a series of 'navigation' steps, prompting it to traverse the graph, update confidences, and potentially expand the graph with new nodes or edges. At each step, the LLM is asked to reassess its overall confidence based on the current state of the graph. The process continues until a confidence threshold is reached or the graph stabilizes. The final confidence estimate is derived from the graph structure, considering factors such as path strengths, conflicting information, and knowledge gaps.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate PKGN against flat confidence estimation techniques and simpler hierarchical methods on tasks requiring complex knowledge integration, such as multi-hop question answering and causal reasoning problems. Assess both the calibration of final confidence estimates and the interpretability of the reasoning process through graph analysis."

        "Title": "Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Navigation for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when reasoning over complex networks of facts and relationships, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates in knowledge-intensive tasks. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks requiring multi-hop reasoning or integration of information from multiple sources.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically treat knowledge as a flat structure or use simple hierarchical representations for confidence estimation. These methods fail to capture the interconnected nature of information and the complex dependencies between facts. By prompting the LLM to construct and navigate a probabilistic knowledge graph, we can better represent the structure of information and provide more accurate, structure-aware uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to reason over complex relationships while providing a more interpretable and calibrated confidence estimation process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Navigation (PKGN), a method that guides the LLM to build and traverse a probabilistic knowledge graph relevant to the query. The process involves the following steps:\n1. Initial Graph Construction: Prompt the LLM to identify key concepts and their relationships, assigning initial confidence scores to each node and edge.\n2. Graph Navigation: Guide the LLM through a series of 'navigation' steps, prompting it to traverse the graph, update confidences, and potentially expand the graph with new nodes or edges.\n3. Confidence Reassessment: At each step, prompt the LLM to reassess its overall confidence based on the current state of the graph.\n4. Termination: Continue the process until a confidence threshold is reached or the graph stabilizes.\n5. Final Confidence Estimation: Derive the final confidence estimate from the graph structure, considering factors such as path strengths, conflicting information, and knowledge gaps.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets:\n1. HotpotQA: A multi-hop question answering dataset that requires reasoning over multiple documents.\n2. TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to test the truthfulness and calibration of language models.\n3. FEVER: A fact verification dataset that requires models to validate or refute claims using evidence.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the LLM to answer the question and provide a confidence score.\n2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use CoT prompting and ask for a final confidence score.\n3. Self-consistency: Generate multiple CoT responses and use the consistency among them as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: PKGN Implementation": "Implement the PKGN method with the following steps:\n1. Initial Graph Construction Prompt: 'Given the question \"{question}\", identify the key concepts and their relationships. Construct a knowledge graph with nodes representing concepts and edges representing relationships. Assign initial confidence scores (0-100) to each node and edge.'\n2. Graph Navigation Prompt: 'Based on the current knowledge graph, what is the next most relevant node or relationship to explore? Update the graph and confidence scores accordingly.'\n3. Confidence Reassessment Prompt: 'Given the current state of the knowledge graph, what is your overall confidence (0-100) in answering the original question? Explain your reasoning.'\n4. Termination Condition: Stop when the overall confidence exceeds 90 or after 5 navigation steps.\n5. Final Answer and Confidence Prompt: 'Based on the final knowledge graph, provide your answer to the original question and your final confidence score. Explain how the graph structure influenced your confidence.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments, as it has demonstrated strong performance in complex reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics:\n1. Answer Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers.\n2. Calibration Error: Compare the model's confidence scores with its actual accuracy.\n3. Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between confidence and accuracy across different confidence buckets.\n4. Brier Score: Assess both the calibration and sharpness of the probabilistic predictions.\n5. AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method:\n1. Run the model on all test examples.\n2. Collect answers, confidence scores, and intermediate reasoning steps (for PKGN, include the constructed knowledge graphs).\n3. Calculate all evaluation metrics.\n4. For PKGN, analyze the evolution of the knowledge graphs and confidence scores across navigation steps.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare PKGN performance against baselines across all metrics.\n2. Analyze how the structure of the knowledge graphs correlates with answer correctness and confidence calibration.\n3. Investigate cases where PKGN significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\n4. Examine the interpretability of PKGN's confidence estimation process through the lens of graph structure and navigation steps."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the director of the movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year that Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100) in your response.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The director of the movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2009, the same year Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States, was Danny Boyle for the film 'Slumdog Millionaire'.\n\nConfidence: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PKGN; Step 1: Initial Graph Construction)": "Given the question \"Who was the director of the movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year that Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States?\", identify the key concepts and their relationships. Construct a knowledge graph with nodes representing concepts and edges representing relationships. Assign initial confidence scores (0-100) to each node and edge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PKGN; Step 1: Initial Graph Construction)": "Knowledge Graph:\n1. Node: Barack Obama (Confidence: 95)\n   Edge: Inaugurated as President (Confidence: 90) -> Node: 2009 (Confidence: 85)\n2. Node: Academy Award for Best Picture (Confidence: 90)\n   Edge: Awarded in (Confidence: 85) -> Node: 2009 (Confidence: 85)\n3. Node: Best Picture Winner 2009 (Confidence: 70)\n   Edge: Directed by (Confidence: 65) -> Node: Unknown Director (Confidence: 50)\n\nInitial overall confidence: 60",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (PKGN; Step 2: Graph Navigation)": "Based on the current knowledge graph, what is the next most relevant node or relationship to explore? Update the graph and confidence scores accordingly.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PKGN; Step 2: Graph Navigation)": "The next most relevant node to explore is the 'Best Picture Winner 2009'. Let's update the graph:\n\nUpdated Knowledge Graph:\n1. Node: Barack Obama (Confidence: 95)\n   Edge: Inaugurated as President (Confidence: 90) -> Node: 2009 (Confidence: 85)\n2.

            "Proposed Prompt Input (PKGN; Step 3: Final Answer and Confidence)": "Based on the final knowledge graph, provide your answer to the original question and your final confidence score. Explain how the graph structure influenced your confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (PKGN; Step 3: Final Answer and Confidence)": "Answer: The director of the movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year that Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States was Danny Boyle, who directed 'Slumdog Millionaire'.\n\nFinal Confidence Score: 90\n\nExplanation: The graph structure significantly influenced my confidence. The high confidence in the nodes for Barack Obama's inauguration year (2009) and the Academy Award for Best Picture being awarded in the same year created a strong foundation. The addition of the 'Slumdog Millionaire' node with high confidence edges connecting it to both the Best Picture win and the year 2009 strengthened the overall structure. The direct edge from 'Slumdog Millionaire' to 'Danny Boyle' as the director, with a high confidence score, provides a clear path to the answer. The interconnectedness of these high-confidence nodes and edges in the graph allows for a more robust and certain conclusion, hence the high final confidence score.",
            "explanation": "PKGN allows for a more structured and interpretable confidence estimation process. By building and navigating a knowledge graph, the model can better represent the relationships between facts and assess its confidence based on the strength and interconnectedness of the information. This approach provides a clear reasoning path and allows for targeted exploration of relevant information, leading to a more calibrated and explainable confidence score compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed PKGN method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the constructed knowledge graphs to gain insights into the model's reasoning process and identify patterns in cases where PKGN succeeds or fails.\n2. Investigate how different graph structures correlate with confidence estimation and answer accuracy. This could lead to the development of graph-based metrics for assessing answer reliability.\n3. Explore variations of the PKGN method, such as using different prompting strategies for graph construction and navigation, or incorporating external knowledge sources to augment the graph.\n4. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to categorize the types of questions or reasoning patterns where PKGN struggles, which could inform future research directions in structured reasoning for LLMs.\n5. Investigate the interpretability aspects of PKGN by comparing the generated graphs with human-created knowledge structures, potentially leading to insights on how LLMs represent and reason over knowledge.\n6. Extend the study to analyze how PKGN performs across different model sizes and architectures, which could provide valuable insights into the scaling behavior of structured reasoning in LLMs."
