    "idea_name": "Metacognitive Uncertainty Decomposition",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLM uncertainty quantification methods often provide only scalar confidence scores, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall confidence scores or probability distributions over possible answers.",
        "Motivation": "Humans can often articulate different sources of uncertainty in their reasoning, such as incomplete information, conflicting evidence, or lack of domain expertise. Prompting LLMs to perform similar metacognitive analysis may yield richer uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Uncertainty Decomposition, a prompting technique that guides the model to: 1) Identify and list potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., 'incomplete information', 'conflicting evidence', 'lack of domain knowledge'). 2) Rate the impact of each uncertainty source on a scale of 1-5. 3) Provide a brief explanation for each rating. 4) Synthesize these components into an overall uncertainty estimate and final answer. This approach produces a more detailed and interpretable uncertainty profile.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test on diverse reasoning tasks including fact verification, causal inference, and ethical dilemmas. Compare against scalar confidence baselines, evaluating both calibration and the quality/usefulness of uncertainty breakdowns through expert human evaluation."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing LLM Uncertainty Quantification through Structured Self-Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Current LLM uncertainty quantification methods often provide only scalar confidence scores, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs, especially in high-stakes decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall confidence scores or probability distributions over possible answers, which may not fully capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. Humans can often articulate different sources of uncertainty in their reasoning, such as incomplete information, conflicting evidence, or lack of domain expertise. Prompting LLMs to perform similar metacognitive analysis may yield richer uncertainty quantification, potentially improving both the accuracy and interpretability of model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Uncertainty Decomposition (MUD), a prompting technique that guides the model to: 1) Identify and list potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., 'incomplete information', 'conflicting evidence', 'lack of domain knowledge'). 2) Rate the impact of each uncertainty source on a scale of 1-5. 3) Provide a brief explanation for each rating. 4) Synthesize these components into an overall uncertainty estimate and final answer. This approach produces a more detailed and interpretable uncertainty profile.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse reasoning tasks from existing datasets: a) Fact verification: FEVER dataset. b) Causal inference: COPA dataset. c) Ethical dilemmas: Moral Scenarios dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Direct answer with scalar confidence: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100%). b) Answer with probability distribution: Prompt the model to provide probabilities for multiple answer choices.",
            "Step 3: MUD Prompt Design": "Design a multi-step prompt for Metacognitive Uncertainty Decomposition: a) Task description. b) Request to list potential uncertainty sources. c) Instructions to rate and explain each source. d) Request for overall uncertainty synthesis and final answer.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo via the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and MUD): a) Process all examples through the chosen model. b) Collect model outputs, including uncertainty estimates and explanations.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare model uncertainty estimates with actual performance. b) Uncertainty resolution: Measure how well uncertainty estimates distinguish correct from incorrect answers. c) Human evaluation: Recruit domain experts to rate the quality and usefulness of uncertainty breakdowns (for MUD only).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare MUD against baselines on calibration and resolution metrics. b) Analyze the distribution and nature of identified uncertainty sources across tasks. c) Evaluate the correlation between decomposed uncertainty sources and answer correctness. d) Summarize human expert ratings on the quality of MUD outputs."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Scalar Confidence)": "Q: Does smoking cause lung cancer? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Scalar Confidence)": "Answer: Yes, smoking causes lung cancer. Confidence: 95%",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Probability Distribution)": "Q: Does smoking cause lung cancer? Please provide probabilities for the following options: A) Yes, B) No, C) Uncertain.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Probability Distribution)": "A) Yes: 95%, B) No: 1%, C) Uncertain: 4%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MUD)": "Q: Does smoking cause lung cancer? Please follow these steps: 1) List potential sources of uncertainty in answering this question. 2) Rate each source on a scale of 1-5 (1 being lowest impact, 5 being highest impact) and briefly explain your rating. 3) Synthesize an overall uncertainty estimate. 4) Provide your final answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MUD)": "1) Potential sources of uncertainty:\n   a) Individual genetic variations\n   b) Exposure to other carcinogens\n   c) Quality and quantity of available studies\n   d) Potential industry influence on research\n\n2) Ratings and explanations:\n   a) Individual genetic variations: 2/5 - While genetics play a role in cancer susceptibility, the link between smoking and lung cancer is strong across populations.\n   b) Exposure to other carcinogens: 3/5 - Other factors can contribute to lung cancer, potentially confounding some studies.\n   c) Quality and quantity of available studies: 1/5 - Extensive, high-quality research has been conducted on this topic over many decades.\n   d) Potential industry influence on research: 2/5 - Historical attempts to dispute the link exist, but the scientific consensus is now overwhelming.\n\n3) Overall uncertainty estimate: Low (15%)\n   The overwhelming scientific evidence and consensus provide high confidence in the causal link between smoking and lung cancer. The main sources of uncertainty are related to individual variations and potential confounding factors, but these do not significantly impact the overall conclusion.\n\n4) Final answer: Yes, smoking causes lung cancer.",
            "Explanation": "The MUD approach provides a more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty profile compared to the baseline methods. It identifies specific sources of uncertainty, quantifies their impact, and explains the reasoning behind each rating. This detailed breakdown allows for a more informed assessment of the model's confidence and the factors influencing its decision."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUD method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of LLM metacognition. We would focus on: 1) Analyzing patterns in the types of uncertainty sources identified across different tasks and domains. 2) Investigating whether the ability to decompose uncertainty correlates with task performance or model size. 3) Exploring how different prompting strategies affect the quality and consistency of uncertainty decomposition. 4) Comparing the uncertainty sources identified by LLMs with those typically considered by human experts in each domain. This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning processes and potential areas for improvement in uncertainty quantification, even if the method doesn't immediately improve performance metrics."
