        "Title": "Metacognitive Lattice Exploration: Decomposing Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to decompose their uncertainty into interpretable components or to explore the relationships between different sources of uncertainty. This limitation hinders our understanding of model behavior and impedes the development of more robust and reliable AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on overall uncertainty estimates without providing detailed breakdowns of uncertainty sources. Drawing inspiration from lattice theory in mathematics and metacognition in cognitive science, we propose a method to systematically explore and decompose an LLM's uncertainty landscape. This approach could provide more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty estimates, potentially improving model reliability and enabling more informed decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Lattice Exploration (MLE), a prompting technique that involves: 1) Defining a set of basic uncertainty types (e.g., factual, logical, contextual) as the 'atoms' of a lattice. 2) Prompting the LLM to generate compound uncertainty types by combining these atoms, forming a lattice structure. 3) For each node in the lattice, eliciting a detailed description of that specific type of uncertainty. 4) Prompting the LLM to explore relationships between nodes, identifying minimal and maximal elements, and discovering complementary uncertainty types. 5) Using this lattice to decompose the overall uncertainty for a given query into its constituent parts. 6) Synthesizing a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for the complex relationships in the uncertainty lattice.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Define Basic Uncertainty Types": "Define a set of basic uncertainty types (atoms) such as factual, logical, contextual, linguistic, and epistemological uncertainty. These will form the basis of our lattice.",
            "Step 2: Implement Lattice Generation": "Develop a prompting strategy to generate compound uncertainty types by combining the basic types. For example, prompt the LLM with: 'Given the basic uncertainty types {factual, logical, contextual, linguistic, epistemological}, generate all possible combinations of these types to form compound uncertainty types. Organize these into a lattice structure.'",
            "Step 3: Elicit Uncertainty Descriptions": "For each node in the lattice, prompt the LLM to provide a detailed description of that specific type of uncertainty. Use a prompt like: 'Describe in detail what {uncertainty type} means in the context of language model outputs. Provide examples of when this type of uncertainty might occur.'",
            "Step 4: Explore Lattice Relationships": "Prompt the LLM to identify relationships between nodes, minimal and maximal elements, and complementary uncertainty types. Use prompts like: 'Identify the relationships between {uncertainty type A} and {uncertainty type B}. Are they complementary? Is one a subset of the other?'",
            "Step 5: Implement Uncertainty Decomposition": "Develop a prompting strategy to use the lattice for decomposing the overall uncertainty of a given query. For example: 'Given the query {query}, decompose the overall uncertainty into its constituent parts based on the uncertainty lattice we've developed. Provide a breakdown of each type of uncertainty present.'",
            "Step 6: Synthesize Final Uncertainty Estimate": "Implement a method to combine the decomposed uncertainties into a final estimate. Prompt the LLM with: 'Based on the decomposed uncertainties for the query {query}, synthesize a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for the relationships in the uncertainty lattice. Provide a confidence score and a detailed explanation of your reasoning.'",
            "Step 7: Prepare Evaluation Datasets": "Curate a diverse set of tasks including question-answering (e.g., TriviaQA), reasoning (e.g., MATH dataset), and open-ended generation tasks. Ensure the dataset covers a wide range of potential uncertainty types.",
            "Step 8: Implement Baselines": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods as baselines, such as softmax entropy, Monte Carlo dropout, and ensemble methods (if applicable to the chosen LLM API).",
            "Step 9: Conduct Experiments": "Apply both the MLE method and baselines to the evaluation datasets. For each query, record the decomposed uncertainties, final uncertainty estimate, and the LLM's response.",
            "Step 10: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of MLE against baselines using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and log loss. Assess the interpretability and coherence of the uncertainty decompositions using human evaluation.",
            "Step 11: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the MLE method, such as varying the number of basic uncertainty types or altering the lattice exploration strategy."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris. I am 95% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MLE Step 1: Lattice Generation)": "Given the basic uncertainty types {factual, logical, contextual, linguistic, epistemological}, generate all possible combinations of these types to form compound uncertainty types. Organize these into a lattice structure.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MLE Step 1: Lattice Generation)": "Lattice structure:\n- Minimal element: {}\n- Atoms: {factual}, {logical}, {contextual}, {linguistic}, {epistemological}\n- 2-combinations: {factual, logical}, {factual, contextual}, ...\n- 3-combinations: {factual, logical, contextual}, ...\n- 4-combinations: {factual, logical, contextual, linguistic}, ...\n- Maximal element: {factual, logical, contextual, linguistic, epistemological}",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MLE Step 2: Uncertainty Decomposition)": "Given the query 'What is the capital of France?', decompose the overall uncertainty into its constituent parts based on the uncertainty lattice we've developed. Provide a breakdown of each type of uncertainty present.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MLE Step 2: Uncertainty Decomposition)": "Uncertainty decomposition:\n1. Factual uncertainty: Very low (1/10) - This is a well-established fact.\n2. Contextual uncertainty: Low (2/10) - The question is clear and doesn't require additional context.\n3. Linguistic uncertainty: Very low (1/10) - The terms 'capital' and 'France' are unambiguous.\n4. Logical uncertainty: Very low (1/10) - No complex reasoning is required.\n5. Epistemological uncertainty: Low (2/10) - This information is widely known and verified.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MLE Step 3: Final Uncertainty Estimate)": "Based on the decomposed uncertainties for the query 'What is the capital of France?', synthesize a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for the relationships in the uncertainty lattice. Provide a confidence score and a detailed explanation of your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MLE Step 3: Final Uncertainty Estimate)": "Final uncertainty estimate: Very Low (7/50 or 14%)\nConfidence score: 96%\nExplanation: The decomposed uncertainties all indicate low levels of uncertainty across different dimensions. The factual, linguistic, and logical uncertainties are particularly low, which are crucial for this type of straightforward factual question. The slightly higher contextual and epistemological uncertainties, while still low, account for the small possibility of misunderstanding or misinformation. The overall low uncertainty across all dimensions, especially in the key areas, results in a high confidence score of 96%.",
            "Explanation": "The MLE method provides a more detailed and interpretable breakdown of uncertainty compared to the baseline. It allows us to understand the sources of uncertainty and how they interact, potentially leading to more reliable and explainable confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MLE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration or interpretability, we can pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of how LLMs conceptualize and express uncertainty. We could investigate patterns in the generated lattices and uncertainty decompositions across different types of queries and domains. This could provide valuable insights into the model's internal representations of uncertainty, even if it doesn't immediately lead to improved quantification. Additionally, we could explore how the MLE method performs on edge cases or adversarial examples, which might reveal interesting failure modes of LLMs in uncertainty estimation. Another direction could be to use the decomposed uncertainties as features for a meta-model that predicts the reliability of the LLM's outputs, potentially improving overall system performance even if the raw uncertainty estimates aren't significantly better."
