    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often provide a single, coarse-grained uncertainty score, failing to capture the nuanced uncertainties that may exist across different aspects of a complex response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on producing an overall uncertainty estimate, without breaking down the uncertainty across different components of the response.",
        "Motivation": "Complex responses often involve multiple sub-components, each with potentially different levels of certainty. By decomposing responses and assessing uncertainty at a more granular level, we can provide more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Decomposition for Granular Uncertainty Mapping (SDGUM), a prompting technique that breaks down complex responses into semantic components and assesses uncertainty for each. First, we prompt the model to generate an initial response to a query. We then instruct the model to identify the key semantic components of its response (e.g., main claims, supporting evidence, causal relationships). For each component, we prompt the model to provide a local uncertainty estimate, considering factors such as the reliability of its knowledge, the logical coherence of the component, and its relevance to the overall response. Finally, we guide the model to synthesize these granular uncertainty estimates into a structured uncertainty map, highlighting areas of high and low confidence within the response. This method provides a more detailed and interpretable assessment of the model's uncertainty across different aspects of its output.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SDGUM against standard prompting and existing uncertainty estimation methods on complex, multi-faceted tasks such as open-ended explanations, analytical reports, and argumentative essays. Evaluate the method's ability to provide fine-grained uncertainty estimates, the interpretability of the resulting uncertainty maps, and their usefulness in identifying specific areas of low confidence within responses."

        "Title": "SDGUM: Semantic Decomposition for Granular Uncertainty Mapping in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often provide a single, coarse-grained uncertainty score, failing to capture the nuanced uncertainties that may exist across different aspects of a complex response. This limitation hinders the interpretability and actionability of uncertainty estimates, particularly in scenarios where different components of a response may have varying levels of confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on producing an overall uncertainty estimate, without breaking down the uncertainty across different components of the response. Complex responses often involve multiple sub-components, each with potentially different levels of certainty. By decomposing responses and assessing uncertainty at a more granular level, we can provide more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where we often have varying levels of confidence in different aspects of our knowledge or reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Decomposition for Granular Uncertainty Mapping (SDGUM), a prompting technique that breaks down complex responses into semantic components and assesses uncertainty for each. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Initial Response Generation: Prompt the model to generate an initial response to a query. 2) Semantic Decomposition: Instruct the model to identify the key semantic components of its response (e.g., main claims, supporting evidence, causal relationships). 3) Local Uncertainty Estimation: For each component, prompt the model to provide a local uncertainty estimate, considering factors such as the reliability of its knowledge, the logical coherence of the component, and its relevance to the overall response. 4) Uncertainty Map Synthesis: Guide the model to synthesize these granular uncertainty estimates into a structured uncertainty map, highlighting areas of high and low confidence within the response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require complex, multi-faceted responses: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended explanations, 2) FEVER for fact verification and analytical reports, and 3) ArgumenText for argumentative essays. These datasets cover a range of tasks that benefit from granular uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting with a single uncertainty score request. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation, if applicable to the chosen model architecture.",
            "Step 3: SDGUM Implementation": "Implement the four steps of SDGUM: a) Initial response generation. b) Semantic decomposition. c) Local uncertainty estimation. d) Uncertainty map synthesis. For each step, create appropriate prompts that guide the model through the process.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are suitable for complex reasoning tasks and can follow multi-step instructions.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Overall accuracy of the final responses. 2) Correlation between granular uncertainty estimates and actual errors. 3) Human evaluation of the interpretability and usefulness of the uncertainty maps.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates using the baseline methods. b) Generate responses and uncertainty maps using SDGUM. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both approaches.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of SDGUM against the baselines. Analyze the granularity and interpretability of the uncertainty maps produced by SDGUM. Investigate cases where SDGUM significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What are the potential impacts of increasing global temperatures on marine ecosystems? Please provide an answer and an overall confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: Increasing global temperatures can have several significant impacts on marine ecosystems:\n1. Ocean acidification due to increased CO2 absorption\n2. Coral bleaching and death of coral reefs\n3. Changes in species distribution and migration patterns\n4. Altered ocean currents affecting nutrient distribution\n5. Increased frequency and severity of marine heatwaves\n\nOverall confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDGUM Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What are the potential impacts of increasing global temperatures on marine ecosystems?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDGUM Step 1: Initial Response)": "Increasing global temperatures can have several significant impacts on marine ecosystems:\n1. Ocean acidification due to increased CO2 absorption\n2. Coral bleaching and death of coral reefs\n3. Changes in species distribution and migration patterns\n4. Altered ocean currents affecting nutrient distribution\n5. Increased frequency and severity of marine heatwaves",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDGUM Step 2: Semantic Decomposition)": "Identify the key semantic components of the response you just provided.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDGUM Step 2: Semantic Decomposition)": "1. Ocean acidification\n2. Coral reef impacts\n3. Species distribution changes\n4. Ocean current alterations\n5. Marine heatwaves",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDGUM Step 3: Local Uncertainty Estimation)": "For each semantic component, provide a local uncertainty estimate (0-100) and a brief explanation for your estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDGUM Step 3: Local Uncertainty Estimation)": "1. Ocean acidification - Confidence: 95/100\nExplanation: This is a well-established consequence of increased CO2 in the atmosphere, supported by extensive research and direct measurements.\n\n2. Coral reef impacts - Confidence: 90/100\nExplanation: Coral bleaching due to temperature increases is well-documented, though there's some uncertainty about the adaptive capacity of certain coral species.\n\n3. Species distribution changes - Confidence: 80/100\nExplanation: While changes in species distribution are observed, the complexity of ecosystems makes precise predictions challenging for all species.\n\n4. Ocean current alterations - Confidence: 75/100\nExplanation: There's strong evidence for some changes in ocean currents, but the full extent and long-term consequences are still being studied.\n\n5. Marine heatwaves - Confidence: 85/100\nExplanation: Increased frequency of marine heatwaves is well-supported by data, but predicting their exact severity and locations involves some uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDGUM Step 4: Uncertainty Map Synthesis)": "Based on the local uncertainty estimates, create a structured uncertainty map for the entire response, highlighting areas of high and low confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDGUM Step 4: Uncertainty Map Synthesis)": "Uncertainty Map for Impacts of Increasing Global Temperatures on Marine Ecosystems:\n\nHigh Confidence (90-100%):\n- Ocean acidification\n- Coral reef impacts\n\nModerate-High Confidence (80-89%):\n- Marine heatwaves\n- Species distribution changes\n\nModerate Confidence (70-79%):\n- Ocean current alterations\n\nOverall, there is high confidence in the direct chemical and physical impacts of temperature increase (ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and marine heatwaves). There is slightly lower, but still substantial confidence in the biological and circulation impacts (species distribution and ocean currents) due to the complex nature of these systems and potential for adaptive responses.\n\nAreas requiring further research to increase confidence:\n1. Long-term adaptive capacity of marine species to temperature changes\n2. Precise modeling of changes in ocean circulation patterns\n3. Interactions between different impacts and potential feedback loops",
            "Explanation": "The SDGUM method provides a more detailed and nuanced view of the model's uncertainty across different aspects of the response. Unlike the baseline method, which gives a single overall confidence score, SDGUM breaks down the uncertainty for each key component of the answer. This granular approach allows users to identify which parts of the response are more reliable and which parts might require further verification or research. The final uncertainty map synthesizes this information into a structured format, providing a clear overview of the confidence levels across different aspects of the response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SDGUM does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the semantic decomposition process to understand how models break down complex responses and whether this aligns with human intuition. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning capabilities. 2) Investigate the relationship between local uncertainty estimates and factual accuracy. This could lead to interesting findings about the model's calibration across different types of knowledge. 3) Explore how different prompting strategies for each step of SDGUM affect the final uncertainty map. This could help identify best practices for eliciting granular uncertainty estimates from language models. 4) Compare SDGUM results across different model sizes and architectures to understand how model capacity affects the ability to provide granular uncertainty estimates. These alternative directions could turn the project into an insightful analysis paper on the nature of uncertainty in language model outputs."
