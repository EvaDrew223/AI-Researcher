        "Problem": "Current prompting methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often fail to capture fine-grained differences in model confidence across different parts of its output.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on global confidence scores or binary uncertainty flags for entire responses.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging the model's own gradients during generation, we can identify which parts of the output the model is most uncertain about, leading to more precise and informative uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Gradient-Guided Uncertainty Prompting (GGUP), a novel method that uses the model's own gradients to guide the expression of uncertainty. During generation, we compute the gradients of the output with respect to the input embeddings. High gradient magnitudes indicate areas of high uncertainty. We then prompt the model to reformulate its response, highlighting these uncertain areas (e.g., 'Rephrase your previous response, expressing uncertainty for parts where you detected high gradients:'). This process can be iterated to refine the uncertainty expressions.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate GGUP against standard uncertainty prompting techniques on tasks requiring fine-grained uncertainty, such as long-form question answering and document summarization. Measure performance using token-level calibration metrics and human evaluation of uncertainty expressions."

        "Title": "Gradient-Guided Uncertainty Prompting: Enhancing Fine-grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current prompting methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture fine-grained differences in model confidence across different parts of its output. This limitation hinders the ability to accurately assess and interpret the model's uncertainty, potentially leading to misinterpretation of results in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on global confidence scores or binary uncertainty flags for entire responses, which lack the granularity needed for precise uncertainty assessment. By leveraging the model's own gradients during generation, we can identify which parts of the output the model is most uncertain about, leading to more precise and informative uncertainty quantification. This approach is inspired by the observation that gradient magnitudes often correlate with model uncertainty, and by exploiting this information, we can guide the model to express its uncertainty more accurately and specifically.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Gradient-Guided Uncertainty Prompting (GGUP), a novel method that uses the model's own gradients to guide the expression of uncertainty. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Generate an initial response to the input query. 2) Compute the gradients of the output with respect to the input embeddings. 3) Identify areas of high uncertainty based on high gradient magnitudes. 4) Prompt the model to reformulate its response, highlighting these uncertain areas. 5) Iterate this process to refine the uncertainty expressions. The key innovation lies in using gradient information to guide the model's attention to specific parts of its output where it is most uncertain, allowing for more precise and informative uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: 1) TriviaQA for long-form question answering, and 2) CNN/Daily Mail for document summarization. These datasets will be split into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. We will also use the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting without uncertainty quantification. 2) Global uncertainty prompting, where the model is asked to provide a single confidence score for the entire output.",
            "Step 4: GGUP Implementation": "Implement the GGUP method as follows: a) Generate initial response. b) Compute gradients using the model's API or by fine-tuning a smaller open-source model to mimic the API model's behavior. c) Identify high-uncertainty regions based on gradient magnitudes. d) Construct a new prompt asking the model to reformulate its response with uncertainty expressions for the identified regions. e) Repeat steps b-d for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Token-level calibration error. 2) Uncertainty-weighted F1 score. 3) Human evaluation of uncertainty expressions (on a subset of examples).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments comparing GGUP against the baselines on both datasets. Use a sample size of 1000 examples for each dataset. Perform 3 iterations of GGUP for each example.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze the results, focusing on: 1) Improvement in fine-grained uncertainty quantification. 2) Correlation between gradient magnitudes and expressed uncertainty. 3) Qualitative analysis of uncertainty expressions.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies on: 1) Number of GGUP iterations. 2) Gradient threshold for identifying uncertain regions. 3) Prompt variations for uncertainty expression."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in what year did this happen?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. This historic event took place on July 20, 1969.",
            "GGUP Prompt Input (Step 1)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in what year did this happen?",
            "GGUP Prompt Expected Output (Step 1)": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. This historic event took place on July 20, 1969.",
            "GGUP Prompt Input (Step 2)": "Rephrase your previous response, expressing uncertainty for parts where you detected high gradients: 'Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. This historic event took place on July 20, 1969.'",
            "GGUP Prompt Expected Output (Step 2)": "I'm confident that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. However, I'm less certain about the exact date. I believe this historic event took place on July 20, 1969, but I'm not entirely sure about the specific day or month.",
            "Explanation": "The GGUP method allows the model to express uncertainty about the specific date, which it might have been less confident about compared to the identity of the first person on the moon. This fine-grained uncertainty expression is not captured by the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If GGUP doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can explore alternative approaches. One option is to analyze the relationship between gradient magnitudes and model uncertainty more deeply, potentially uncovering insights about when and why this correlation breaks down. We could also investigate other model-intrinsic signals of uncertainty, such as the entropy of the output distribution or the sensitivity of the output to small perturbations in the input. Additionally, we could explore ensemble methods, combining GGUP with other uncertainty quantification techniques to create a more robust approach. Finally, we could shift the focus to analyzing why current uncertainty quantification methods struggle with fine-grained assessments, potentially leading to new insights about the limitations and capabilities of large language models in expressing uncertainty."
