    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across different types of questions and knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically involve direct prompting for confidence scores or using model logits as proxies for uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by human metacognition, we propose that models can better calibrate their confidence by recursively questioning and refining their own certainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Calibration (RCC), a multi-step prompting technique. First, the model is asked to provide an answer and initial confidence score. Then, it's prompted to generate a series of self-reflective questions about its answer and confidence (e.g., 'What evidence supports this?', 'What could contradict this?'). The model answers these questions and updates its confidence. This process repeats for several iterations, with the model generating new questions based on previous reflections. Finally, the model provides a calibrated confidence score and justification. Prompts are carefully designed to encourage honest self-assessment and avoid overconfidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RCC against standard confidence prompting and logit-based uncertainty estimation on diverse question-answering datasets. Evaluate using calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error and Brier Score. Analyze how confidence scores evolve through iterations and correlate with answer correctness."

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models through Self-Reflection",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across different types of questions and knowledge domains, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones. This misalignment between confidence and accuracy can result in unreliable decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence calibration typically involve direct prompting for confidence scores or using model logits as proxies for uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the nuanced reasoning process that humans use when assessing their own confidence. Inspired by human metacognition, we propose that models can better calibrate their confidence by recursively questioning and refining their own certainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's ability to generate self-reflective questions and analyze its own reasoning, potentially leading to more accurate and justifiable confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Calibration (RCC), a multi-step prompting technique. The process works as follows: 1) The model is asked to provide an initial answer and confidence score. 2) It's then prompted to generate a series of self-reflective questions about its answer and confidence (e.g., 'What evidence supports this?', 'What could contradict this?'). 3) The model answers these questions and updates its confidence. 4) This process repeats for several iterations, with the model generating new questions based on previous reflections. 5) Finally, the model provides a calibrated confidence score and justification. Prompts are carefully designed to encourage honest self-assessment and avoid overconfidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse question-answering datasets: 1) TriviaQA for general knowledge, 2) SciQ for scientific reasoning, and 3) BoolQ for yes/no questions. These datasets cover a range of difficulty levels and knowledge domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Standard confidence prompting: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. b) Logit-based uncertainty estimation: Use the softmax output of the model's last layer as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: RCC Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Confidence Calibration method with the following steps: a) Initial answer and confidence generation. b) Self-reflective question generation. c) Question answering and confidence updating. d) Iteration (repeat b and c for 3 rounds). e) Final calibrated confidence score and justification.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of RCC. For example: a) Initial prompt: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' b) Self-reflection prompt: 'Generate 3 questions that could help verify or challenge your answer and confidence.' c) Updating prompt: 'Based on your answers to these questions, update your confidence score if necessary.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run the RCC method. c) Collect answers, confidence scores, and intermediate steps for analysis.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure of calibration across confidence buckets. c) Brier Score: Combines calibration and resolution aspects of probabilistic forecasts. d) Confidence-Accuracy Correlation: Pearson correlation between confidence scores and correctness.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare RCC performance against baselines across different datasets and models. b) Analyze how confidence scores evolve through iterations. c) Examine the quality and relevance of self-reflective questions. d) Investigate cases where RCC significantly improves or worsens calibration compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "RCC Prompt Input (Step 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and an initial confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "RCC Prompt Expected Output (Step 1)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Initial confidence score: 95",
            "RCC Prompt Input (Step 2)": "Generate 3 questions that could help verify or challenge your answer and confidence.",
            "RCC Prompt Expected Output (Step 2)": "1. What is the source of my knowledge about Paris being the capital of France?\n2. Are there any historical periods when Paris was not the capital of France?\n3. Could there be any recent political changes that might have affected the capital status of Paris?",
            "RCC Prompt Input (Step 3)": "Please answer these questions:",
            "RCC Prompt Expected Output (Step 3)": "1. My knowledge comes from widely accepted geographical facts, educational materials, and consistent information across various reliable sources.\n2. Yes, during the German occupation in World War II, Vichy temporarily served as the capital of France. However, Paris was reinstated as the capital after liberation.\n3. There have been no recent political changes affecting Paris's status as the capital of France. It has been the stable capital for decades.",
            "RCC Prompt Input (Final Step)": "Based on your answers to these questions, provide your final answer, an updated confidence score if necessary, and a justification for your confidence.",
            "RCC Prompt Expected Output (Final Step)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nUpdated Confidence Score: 98\nJustification: My confidence has slightly increased because I was able to recall the historical context and confirm the stability of Paris as the capital. The brief period when Vichy served as capital during WWII doesn't affect the current status. Multiple reliable sources consistently confirm Paris as the capital, and there have been no recent changes to this fact.",
            "Explanation": "The RCC method allows the model to engage in self-reflection, considering potential challenges to its initial answer. This process leads to a more nuanced and justified confidence assessment, potentially improving calibration compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RCC method doesn't significantly improve calibration over the baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine the quality of self-reflective questions generated, assessing whether they're truly probing relevant uncertainties or merely restating known information. We might also investigate whether the iterative process leads to confidence polarization (becoming overconfident or underconfident) rather than improved calibration. Additionally, we could explore how the effectiveness of RCC varies across different question types or knowledge domains, potentially revealing insights about the model's metacognitive abilities in different areas. This analysis could inform the development of more targeted or domain-specific confidence calibration techniques, turning the project into an insightful study of LLM metacognition rather than a method paper."
