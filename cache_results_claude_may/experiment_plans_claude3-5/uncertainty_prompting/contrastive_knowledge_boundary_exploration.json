    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident predictions in areas where their knowledge is limited or uncertain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs, which may not effectively probe the edges of model knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of contrastive learning and active learning strategies, we propose that model uncertainty can be more accurately quantified by actively exploring the boundaries of its knowledge through contrastive examples.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Knowledge Boundary Exploration (CKBE), a prompting technique that assesses model confidence by systematically probing the edges of its knowledge domain. CKBE works by generating a series of contrastive prompts that gradually move from well-established facts to increasingly uncertain or false statements within the same domain. These prompts are dynamically generated based on the model's responses, using a tree-like exploration strategy to efficiently map out the knowledge boundaries. The model's confidence is then quantified based on its ability to correctly distinguish between known facts, uncertain information, and false statements. This approach allows for a more precise mapping of model uncertainty, particularly in identifying areas where the model's knowledge transitions from certain to uncertain.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CKBE against traditional confidence estimation techniques on a range of knowledge-intensive tasks, including fact verification, open-domain question answering, and knowledge graph completion. We will use existing benchmarks like TruthfulQA and OpenBookQA, as well as construct specialized test sets designed to probe specific knowledge boundaries. Performance will be measured using both standard metrics like calibration error and novel metrics designed to capture the accuracy of confidence estimates near knowledge boundaries."

        "Title": "Contrastive Knowledge Boundary Exploration: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident predictions in areas where their knowledge is limited or uncertain. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to quantifying model uncertainty typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs, which may not effectively probe the edges of model knowledge. Inspired by the concepts of contrastive learning and active learning strategies, we propose that model uncertainty can be more accurately quantified by actively exploring the boundaries of its knowledge through contrastive examples. This approach allows for a more precise mapping of model uncertainty, particularly in identifying areas where the model's knowledge transitions from certain to uncertain.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Knowledge Boundary Exploration (CKBE), a prompting technique that assesses model confidence by systematically probing the edges of its knowledge domain. CKBE works by generating a series of contrastive prompts that gradually move from well-established facts to increasingly uncertain or false statements within the same domain. These prompts are dynamically generated based on the model's responses, using a tree-like exploration strategy to efficiently map out the knowledge boundaries. The process involves the following steps: 1) Start with a well-established fact in a specific domain. 2) Generate contrastive statements that gradually deviate from the initial fact. 3) Present these statements to the model and analyze its responses. 4) Based on the model's confidence in its responses, generate new contrastive statements that further probe the knowledge boundaries. 5) Repeat steps 3-4 until a clear transition from certain to uncertain knowledge is identified. 6) Quantify the model's confidence based on its ability to correctly distinguish between known facts, uncertain information, and false statements.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use existing benchmarks like TruthfulQA and OpenBookQA, as well as construct specialized test sets designed to probe specific knowledge boundaries. For each dataset, we will create a subset of questions that span from well-established facts to increasingly uncertain or false statements within the same domain.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement traditional confidence estimation techniques: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Softmax probabilities: For multiple-choice questions, use the softmax probabilities of the model's output as a confidence measure.",
            "Step 4: CKBE Implementation": "1) Initial prompt generation: For each question in our dataset, generate an initial set of 5 contrastive statements ranging from factual to increasingly uncertain. 2) Tree-like exploration: Implement a function that generates new contrastive statements based on the model's responses to previous statements. 3) Confidence quantification: Develop a scoring mechanism that assesses the model's ability to distinguish between facts, uncertain information, and false statements.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "1) Run baseline methods on all datasets. 2) Run CKBE on all datasets, using the following prompt structure for each question: 'Consider the following statements related to [topic]: [List of contrastive statements]. For each statement, indicate whether it is True, False, or Uncertain, and provide your confidence level (0-100) for each judgment.' 3) Collect model responses and confidence scores for both baseline and CKBE methods.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "1) Calculate standard metrics like calibration error, Brier score, and AUC-ROC for both baseline and CKBE methods. 2) Implement a new metric, Knowledge Boundary Precision (KBP), which measures the accuracy of the model in identifying the transition point from certain to uncertain knowledge. 3) Compare the performance of CKBE against baseline methods across all metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Visualize the knowledge boundaries identified by CKBE for different domains. 2) Analyze patterns in how the model's confidence changes as statements become more uncertain or false. 3) Identify specific areas where CKBE outperforms or underperforms compared to baseline methods."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Consider the following statements related to the capital of France: 1) Paris is the capital of France. 2) Lyon is the second-largest city in France. 3) Marseille is the capital of France. 4) France has multiple capital cities. 5) The Eiffel Tower is located in the capital of France. For each statement, indicate whether it is True, False, or Uncertain, and provide your confidence level (0-100) for each judgment.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1) True, Confidence: 100 2) True, Confidence: 95 3) False, Confidence: 100 4) False, Confidence: 90 5) True, Confidence: 100",
            "Explanation": "The CKBE method allows for a more nuanced assessment of the model's knowledge boundaries. While the baseline method only provides a single confidence score, CKBE reveals how the model's confidence changes across different types of statements, from well-established facts to false information. This approach helps identify the point at which the model's knowledge transitions from certain to uncertain."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CKBE does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Examining the generated contrastive statements to ensure they effectively probe knowledge boundaries. 2) Analyzing cases where CKBE fails to accurately identify uncertainty. 3) Investigating whether certain domains or types of knowledge are particularly challenging for CKBE. Based on these findings, we could refine the CKBE method, perhaps by incorporating domain-specific knowledge or adjusting the tree-like exploration strategy. Alternatively, we could pivot to an analysis paper that provides insights into the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty quantification methods for large language models, offering recommendations for when each method is most appropriate."
