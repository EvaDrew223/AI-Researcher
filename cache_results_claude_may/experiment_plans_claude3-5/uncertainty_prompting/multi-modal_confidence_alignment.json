    "idea_name": "Multi-Modal Confidence Alignment",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to leverage the rich information available in multi-modal contexts, leading to potentially misaligned confidence estimates across different modalities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on text-based confidence estimation, neglecting the potential for cross-modal validation and uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by recent advances in multi-modal learning and cognitive science research on cross-modal perception, we propose that model uncertainty can be more accurately assessed by aligning confidence estimates across different modalities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Modal Confidence Alignment (MMCA), a novel prompting technique that quantifies model uncertainty by leveraging information from multiple modalities. MMCA works by generating a series of prompts that require the model to reason about the same concept or scenario across different modalities (e.g., text, images, audio). These prompts are carefully designed to test the model's ability to maintain consistent confidence levels across modalities. The technique involves three main steps: 1) Generate uni-modal confidence estimates for each modality, 2) Create cross-modal prompts that require integrating information from multiple modalities, and 3) Analyze the alignment and discrepancies between confidence estimates across modalities. This approach allows for a more robust assessment of model uncertainty, particularly in real-world scenarios where information is often available in multiple forms.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MMCA against traditional uni-modal uncertainty estimation methods on a range of multi-modal tasks, including visual question answering, audio-visual scene understanding, and multi-modal fact verification. We will use existing benchmarks like VQA and AudioCaps, as well as develop new datasets specifically designed to test cross-modal confidence alignment. Performance will be measured using both standard metrics and novel measures designed to capture the accuracy and consistency of uncertainty estimates across different modalities."

        "Title": "Multi-Modal Confidence Alignment: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to leverage the rich information available in multi-modal contexts, leading to potentially misaligned confidence estimates across different modalities. This misalignment can result in unreliable model outputs, especially in real-world scenarios where information is presented in various forms.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on text-based confidence estimation, neglecting the potential for cross-modal validation and uncertainty quantification. Recent advances in multi-modal learning and cognitive science research on cross-modal perception suggest that model uncertainty can be more accurately assessed by aligning confidence estimates across different modalities. By leveraging information from multiple modalities, we can potentially achieve more robust and reliable uncertainty estimates, leading to improved model performance and trustworthiness in diverse real-world applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multi-Modal Confidence Alignment (MMCA), a novel prompting technique that quantifies model uncertainty by leveraging information from multiple modalities. MMCA works by generating a series of prompts that require the model to reason about the same concept or scenario across different modalities (e.g., text, images, audio).

This approach allows for a more robust assessment of model uncertainty, particularly in real-world scenarios where information is often available in multiple forms.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use existing multi-modal datasets such as VQA (Visual Question Answering) and AudioCaps for our experiments. Additionally, we will create a new dataset specifically designed to test cross-modal confidence alignment, which we'll call MultiModalConfidence (MMC). This dataset will include examples where information is presented in text, image, and audio formats, with varying degrees of difficulty and ambiguity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement traditional uni-modal uncertainty estimation methods for comparison. These will include: a) Monte Carlo Dropout for text-only inputs, b) Ensemble methods for image-only inputs, and c) Temperature scaling for audio-only inputs.",
            "Step 3: MMCA Implementation": "Develop the MMCA prompting technique. This involves creating a set of prompts for each modality and cross-modal combinations. For example: a) Text-only prompt: 'Describe the content of this paragraph and rate your confidence from 0 to 100.' b) Image-only prompt: 'Describe this image and rate your confidence from 0 to 100.' c) Audio-only prompt: 'Describe the content of this audio clip and rate your confidence from 0 to 100.' d) Text-Image cross-modal prompt: 'Does the image support the information in the text? Rate your confidence from 0 to 100.' e) Text-Audio cross-modal prompt: 'Does the audio clip support the information in the text? Rate your confidence from 0 to 100.' f) Image-Audio cross-modal prompt: 'Does the audio clip describe the content of the image? Rate your confidence from 0 to 100.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model due to its multi-modal capabilities. We will also test with GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) for text-only tasks and compare the results.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each example in our datasets: a) Apply baseline methods to get uni-modal confidence estimates. b) Apply MMCA technique to get multi-modal confidence estimates. c) Record the confidence scores and model outputs for each method.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Confidence Calibration Error (CCE): Measure how well the confidence scores align with actual performance. b) Cross-Modal Alignment Score (CMAS): A new metric we'll develop to quantify the consistency of confidence estimates across modalities. c) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy for VQA, BLEU score for captioning tasks). d) Qualitative analysis of cases where MMCA significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, focusing on: a) Comparison of MMCA performance against baselines across different tasks and modalities. b) Identification of patterns in cross-modal confidence alignment. c) Analysis of cases where multi-modal information significantly impacts confidence estimation. d) Investigation of the relationship between confidence alignment and task performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Text: 'The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris.' Image: [An image of the Eiffel Tower] Audio: [Audio clip of French language]",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Based on the text, where is the Eiffel Tower located? Rate your confidence from 0 to 100.",
                "Expected Output": "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris. Confidence: 95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method only considers the text input, ignoring potentially valuable information from the image and audio."
            },
            "MMCA Example": {
                "Input": "Text: 'The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris.' Image: [An image of the Eiffel Tower] Audio: [Audio clip of French language]",
                "MMCA Prompts": [
                    "Based on the text, where is the Eiffel Tower located? Rate your confidence from 0 to 100.",
                    "Describe the image and rate your confidence from 0 to 100 that it shows the Eiffel Tower.",
                    "Describe the audio and rate your confidence from 0 to 100 that it's related to the location mentioned in the text.",
                    "Does the image support the information in the text? Rate your confidence from 0 to 100.",
                    "Does the audio support the information in the text? Rate your confidence from 0 to 100."
                ],
                "Expected Output": "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris. Text confidence: 95, Image confidence: 98, Audio confidence: 80, Text-Image alignment: 97, Text-Audio alignment: 85. Overall confidence: 92",
                "Explanation": "MMCA considers information from all modalities, providing a more comprehensive confidence estimate. The slight decrease in overall confidence compared to the text-only baseline reflects the integration of the lower confidence in the audio modality."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MMCA method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Investigating whether certain modalities consistently provide more reliable confidence estimates and adjusting our method to weigh these more heavily. 2) Analyzing cases where cross-modal information leads to decreased performance, which could inform the development of more sophisticated integration techniques. 3) Exploring alternative prompting strategies that might better elicit cross-modal reasoning from the model. 4) Considering the development of a fine-tuning approach on a small dataset to improve the model's ability to align confidence across modalities. Additionally, we could pivot to focus on creating a comprehensive analysis of how different types of multi-modal information impact uncertainty estimation in LLMs, which could provide valuable insights for future research in this area."
