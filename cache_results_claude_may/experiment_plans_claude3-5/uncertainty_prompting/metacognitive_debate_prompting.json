    "idea_name": "Metacognitive Debate Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge limitations and reasoning flaws, leading to miscalibrated confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on external calibration or simple self-reflection prompts.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating an internal debate or peer review process, we can encourage the model to critically examine its own reasoning and identify potential weaknesses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Debate Prompting (MDP), a technique that guides the LLM to engage in a simulated internal debate about its own reasoning process. For a given query, MDP uses a series of prompts such as 'Provide your initial answer and reasoning', 'Now, take on the role of a skeptical peer reviewer and critique your own reasoning', 'Respond to the critique and update your answer if necessary', and 'Based on this debate, provide your final answer and a calibrated confidence score'. This process encourages the model to consider multiple perspectives and potential flaws in its reasoning.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MDP with standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods on complex reasoning tasks, including scientific question answering and logical puzzles. Evaluate using calibration metrics, and also assess the quality and insight of the generated metacognitive debates."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Debate Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge limitations and reasoning flaws, leading to miscalibrated confidence in their outputs. This issue can result in unreliable or potentially harmful responses in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on external calibration or simple self-reflection prompts, which may not fully leverage the model's reasoning capabilities. By simulating an internal debate or peer review process, we can encourage the model to critically examine its own reasoning and identify potential weaknesses. This approach is inspired by human metacognition and scientific peer review processes, where multiple perspectives and critical analysis lead to more robust conclusions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Debate Prompting (MDP), a technique that guides the LLM to engage in a simulated internal debate about its own reasoning process. For a given query, MDP uses a series of prompts to structure the model's thought process: 1) Provide an initial answer and reasoning, 2) Take on the role of a skeptical peer reviewer and critique the initial reasoning, 3) Respond to the critique and update the answer if necessary, and 4) Based on this debate, provide a final answer and a calibrated confidence score. This process encourages the model to consider multiple perspectives and potential flaws in its reasoning, leading to more nuanced and potentially more accurate responses.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that cover complex reasoning tasks, including: a) Scientific question answering: SciQ dataset, b) Logical puzzles: LogiQA dataset, c) Commonsense reasoning: CommonsenseQA dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting: Direct question answering, b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, c) Self-consistency: Generate multiple CoT responses and aggregate, d) Calibrated self-evaluation: Ask model to provide confidence score after answering.",
            "Step 3: Metacognitive Debate Prompting Implementation": "Implement the MDP method with the following steps for each query: a) Initial answer generation, b) Self-critique generation, c) Response to critique and potential answer update, d) Final answer and confidence score generation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method: a) Generate responses for all queries, b) For MDP and baselines that produce confidence scores, record these scores, c) For methods without inherent confidence scores, use the model's output probability as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers, b) Calibration error: Difference between confidence and accuracy, c) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Weighted average of calibration errors across confidence buckets, d) Brier score: Combines calibration and accuracy in a single metric.",
            "Step 7: Qualitative Analysis": "Randomly sample 100 examples from each dataset. Analyze the quality of the generated debates, focusing on: a) Relevance and insightfulness of self-critiques, b) Appropriateness of responses to critiques, c) Justification for confidence scores.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of each component of MDP: a) Remove self-critique step, b) Remove response to critique step, c) Vary the number of debate rounds (1, 2, 3 rounds)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: A researcher is studying the effects of a new drug on blood pressure. In a clinical trial with 100 participants, 60 people showed a decrease in blood pressure, 30 showed no change, and 10 showed an increase. What percentage of participants experienced a decrease in blood pressure? Provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "60% of participants experienced a decrease in blood pressure. Confidence level: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Metacognitive Debate Prompting)": "Q: A researcher is studying the effects of a new drug on blood pressure. In a clinical trial with 100 participants, 60 people showed a decrease in blood pressure, 30 showed no change, and 10 showed an increase. What percentage of participants experienced a decrease in blood pressure?\n\n1. Provide your initial answer and reasoning:\n2. Now, take on the role of a skeptical peer reviewer and critique your own reasoning:\n3. Respond to the critique and update your answer if necessary:\n4. Based on this debate, provide your final answer and a calibrated confidence score from 0 to 100:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Metacognitive Debate Prompting)": "1. Initial answer and reasoning: 60% of participants experienced a decrease in blood pressure. This is calculated by dividing the number of people who showed a decrease (60) by the total number of participants (100) and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n2. Critique: The calculation seems correct, but we should consider potential sources of error or uncertainty. For instance, we don't know the margin of error for the measurements or if there were any dropouts from the study. Additionally, we should consider if a simple percentage is the most appropriate way to report these results, or if we should include confidence intervals.\n\n3. Response to critique: The critique raises valid points. While the calculation is mathematically correct, there are indeed factors we don't know that could affect the interpretation of the results. However, given the information provided in the question, we can't account for these factors in our answer. We should acknowledge these limitations in our final response.\n\n4. Final answer and confidence score: 60% of participants experienced a decrease in blood pressure. However, it's important to note that this figure doesn't account for potential measurement errors or other factors that could influence the interpretation of the results. Confidence score: 85\n\nThe confidence score is lower than it might be for a simple calculation because we've acknowledged the limitations in the data provided and the potential for other factors to influence a more nuanced interpretation of the results.",
            "Explanation": "The MDP approach leads to a more nuanced answer that acknowledges potential limitations and sources of uncertainty. This results in a more calibrated confidence score compared to the baseline method, which provided a very high confidence without considering potential sources of error or uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MDP method doesn't significantly improve calibration or accuracy compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated debates to understand where the method falls short. This could involve categorizing types of self-critiques and responses, and correlating them with performance. 2) Explore variations of the MDP method, such as incorporating external knowledge sources for fact-checking during the debate process, or experimenting with different debate structures (e.g., having the model play multiple distinct 'personas' with different expertise). 3) Investigate how the effectiveness of MDP varies across different types of questions or domains, which could provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in different reasoning contexts. 4) Combine MDP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. These alternative directions could still provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning and uncertainty quantification, even if the original hypothesis isn't fully supported."
