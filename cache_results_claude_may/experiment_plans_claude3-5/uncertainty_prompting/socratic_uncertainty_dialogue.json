    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overly simplified confidence estimates that fail to capture the nuanced nature of their uncertainty, particularly in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-shot confidence estimation or limited self-reflection techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By engaging the LLM in a Socratic-style dialogue focused on exploring the sources and extent of its uncertainty, we can elicit a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of its confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Socratic Uncertainty Dialogue (SUD), a multi-turn prompting technique that simulates a philosophical inquiry into the LLM's certainty. After an initial response, we prompt the LLM to take on the role of a Socratic questioner, asking probing questions about potential weaknesses or assumptions in its answer. The LLM then switches roles to defend and refine its position. This dialogue continues for several turns, with prompts designed to explore different aspects of uncertainty (e.g., 'What's the weakest part of your argument?', 'How might an expert in this field disagree?'). The final confidence assessment is derived from analyzing the full dialogue, considering factors such as the number and nature of identified weaknesses, the strength of counter-arguments, and the degree of refinement in the final position.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SUD with standard confidence elicitation and other reflective prompting techniques on complex reasoning tasks such as ethical dilemmas and scientific hypothesis evaluation. Evaluate using both quantitative calibration metrics and qualitative assessment of the depth and nuance of uncertainty characterization."

        "Title": "Socratic Uncertainty Dialogue: Eliciting Nuanced Confidence Estimates from Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overly simplified confidence estimates that fail to capture the nuanced nature of their uncertainty, particularly in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation can lead to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones, potentially misleading users and hindering the models' effectiveness in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in LLMs typically rely on single-shot confidence scores or limited self-reflection techniques. These methods often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. By engaging the LLM in a Socratic-style dialogue focused on exploring the sources and extent of its uncertainty, we can elicit a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of its confidence. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to engage in meta-cognitive reasoning and self-analysis, potentially leading to more accurate and informative uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Socratic Uncertainty Dialogue (SUD), a multi-turn prompting technique that simulates a philosophical inquiry into the LLM's certainty. The process involves the following steps: 1) Initial response generation: The LLM provides an initial answer to the given question. 2) Socratic questioning: The LLM is prompted to take on the role of a Socratic questioner, asking probing questions about potential weaknesses or assumptions in its answer. 3) Self-defense and refinement: The LLM switches roles to defend and refine its position in light of the questions raised. 4) Iteration: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated for several turns, with prompts designed to explore different aspects of uncertainty (e.g., 'What's the weakest part of your argument?', 'How might an expert in this field disagree?'). 5) Final assessment: The LLM provides a final confidence assessment based on the full dialogue, considering factors such as the number and nature of identified weaknesses, the strength of counter-arguments, and the degree of refinement in the final position.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve complex reasoning: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing the model's ability to avoid false statements, 2) BIG-Bench's 'logical fallacies' task for evaluating logical reasoning, and 3) the 'ethical dilemmas' subset from the Anthropic RLHF dataset for moral reasoning. Each dataset should contain at least 100 questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct confidence estimation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each question. b) Simple self-reflection: After the initial answer, prompt with 'Reflect on your answer. What might be some weaknesses in your reasoning?' c) Calibrated confidence estimation: Fine-tune a small model (e.g., DistilBERT) on the LLM's outputs to predict calibrated probabilities.",
            "Step 3: SUD Implementation": "Implement the Socratic Uncertainty Dialogue method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation. b) Socratic questioning (3 rounds). c) Self-defense and refinement (3 rounds). d) Final confidence assessment. Use few-shot examples to guide the model in generating appropriate questions and responses for each step.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as our primary models, with GPT-3.5-turbo as a comparison point for assessing the impact of model size on the effectiveness of SUD.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Generate responses and confidence estimates using all methods (baselines and SUD). b) For SUD, store the full dialogue for each question to enable qualitative analysis. c) Repeat the process 3 times with different random seeds to account for potential variance in model outputs.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "a) Quantitative: Calculate calibration error, Brier score, and ECE (Expected Calibration Error) for each method. b) Qualitative: Manually review a subset of SUD dialogues to assess the depth and relevance of the uncertainty exploration. c) Analyze the relationship between dialogue length/complexity and final confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Reporting": "a) Compare the performance of SUD against baselines across different models and datasets. b) Investigate how the dialogue process affects confidence estimates compared to single-shot methods. c) Identify patterns in the types of questions and self-reflections that lead to the most significant adjustments in confidence."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: Is it ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: It can be ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings in certain situations, but it depends on the specific circumstances and potential consequences. Generally, small white lies that prevent unnecessary hurt without causing harm may be considered ethical. However, lying about important matters or consistently deceiving someone is usually not ethical, even if meant to protect their feelings. Confidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUD; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Is it ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUD; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: It can be ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings in certain situations, but it depends on the specific circumstances and potential consequences. Generally, small white lies that prevent unnecessary hurt without causing harm may be considered ethical. However, lying about important matters or consistently deceiving someone is usually not ethical, even if meant to protect their feelings.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUD; Step 2: Socratic Questioning)": "Now, take on the role of a Socratic questioner. Ask three probing questions that challenge the initial response or explore potential weaknesses in the reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUD; Step 2: Socratic Questioning)": "1. How do we determine the line between a 'small white lie' and a more significant deception? Isn't this subjective?\n2. Could lying to protect someone's feelings potentially rob them of the opportunity for personal growth or facing reality?\n3. How does lying, even with good intentions, affect the trust and authenticity in a relationship over time?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUD; Step 3: Self-defense and Refinement)": "Now, defend your initial position against these questions and refine your answer if necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUD; Step 3: Self-defense and Refinement)": "You raise important points that highlight the complexity of this issue:\n1. The line between a small white lie and significant deception is indeed subjective and context-dependent. We must consider factors like the potential harm, the importance of the truth, and the nature of the relationship.\n2. You're right that lying might deprive someone of growth opportunities. This is a crucial consideration that I should have mentioned. In some cases, honest feedback, even if painful, could be more beneficial in the long run.\n3. The impact on trust is a valid concern. Frequent lying, even with good intentions, can erode the foundation of a relationship.\nRefined answer: While there may be rare situations where a small lie to protect feelings is ethically justifiable, generally, honesty is the best policy. Instead of lying, we should focus on communicating difficult truths with empathy and kindness. This approach maintains trust, allows for personal growth, and respects the other person's autonomy to handle the truth.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUD; Final Confidence Assessment)": "Based on this dialogue, provide a final confidence assessment (0-100%) for your refined answer. Explain the reasoning behind your confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUD; Final Confidence Assessment)": "Final confidence: 85%\nReasoning: The dialogue process has increased my confidence in the refined answer. By exploring potential weaknesses and addressing important counterarguments, we've arrived at a more nuanced and balanced perspective. The refined answer acknowledges the complexity of the issue, considers multiple ethical principles (honesty, harm prevention, respect for autonomy), and provides a general guideline while recognizing that exceptions may exist. However, I'm not 100% confident because ethics can be highly situational, and there may be extreme cases or cultural contexts not fully accounted for in this general assessment.",
            "explanation": "The SUD method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the ethical dilemma, leading to a refined answer that considers multiple perspectives. The final confidence assessment is higher than the baseline but not overly confident, reflecting a more thoughtful consideration of the complexities involved. The explanation for the confidence level demonstrates a meta-cognitive awareness of both the strengths and limitations of the refined position."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the SUD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration metrics, we can pivot the project to focus on a qualitative analysis of the uncertainty exploration process. We could investigate patterns in how LLMs reason about their own uncertainty, categorize types of self-identified weaknesses, and analyze how different prompting strategies affect the depth and breadth of uncertainty consideration. This could provide valuable insights into the meta-cognitive capabilities of LLMs and inform future research on improving uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we could explore combining SUD with other techniques, such as using the generated dialogues as input for a secondary confidence estimation model, potentially creating a hybrid approach that leverages both the rich uncertainty exploration of SUD and the potential for better calibration through machine learning-based post-processing."
