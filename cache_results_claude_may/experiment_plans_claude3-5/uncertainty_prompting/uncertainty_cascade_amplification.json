        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different levels of abstraction and knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single-step uncertainty estimation or simple calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems and aggregate uncertainty estimates from these sub-problems. This approach could potentially lead to more accurate and granular uncertainty quantification in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Cascade Amplification (UCA), a multi-step prompting technique that recursively decomposes a given query into sub-queries, estimates uncertainty for each sub-query, and then aggregates these estimates. The process involves: 1) Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the main query into a set of sub-queries. 2) Sub-query Uncertainty Estimation: For each sub-query, prompt the LLM to provide an answer and an associated confidence score. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: Prompt the LLM to reason about how uncertainties in sub-queries affect the overall uncertainty. 4) Aggregation: Finally, prompt the LLM to synthesize an overall answer and uncertainty estimate based on the sub-query results and their propagated uncertainties.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare UCA against standard single-step uncertainty estimation and other baseline methods on a diverse set of complex reasoning tasks. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human expert uncertainty judgments."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Cascade Amplification: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models through Recursive Decomposition",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different levels of abstraction and knowledge domains. This limitation hinders their reliability and applicability in critical decision-making scenarios where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches often rely on single-step uncertainty estimation or simple calibration techniques, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties in complex reasoning tasks. Human experts often break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems and aggregate uncertainty estimates from these sub-problems. This approach could potentially lead to more accurate and granular uncertainty quantification in LLMs. By mimicking this human-like reasoning process, we aim to improve the LLMs' ability to assess their own uncertainty more accurately and comprehensively.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Cascade Amplification (UCA), a multi-step prompting technique that recursively decomposes a given query into sub-queries, estimates uncertainty for each sub-query, and then aggregates these estimates. The process involves four main steps: 1) Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the main query into a set of sub-queries. 2) Sub-query Uncertainty Estimation: For each sub-query, prompt the LLM to provide an answer and an associated confidence score. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: Prompt the LLM to reason about how uncertainties in sub-queries affect the overall uncertainty. 4) Aggregation: Finally, prompt the LLM to synthesize an overall answer and uncertainty estimate based on the sub-query results and their propagated uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of complex reasoning tasks from existing datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and uncertainty, 2) GSM8K for multi-step mathematical reasoning, and 3) MMLU for domain-specific knowledge across various fields. We will randomly sample 1000 questions from each dataset for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the LLM the question and request a confidence score. b) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during generation and interpret the variation in outputs as uncertainty. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: Generate multiple outputs with dropout and use the variance as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: UCA Implementation": "Implement the UCA method with the following sub-steps for each query: a) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down this question into 3-5 simpler sub-questions that, when answered, would help solve the main question.' b) Sub-query uncertainty prompt: 'Answer this sub-question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100.' c) Uncertainty propagation prompt: 'Given the sub-questions, their answers, and confidence scores, explain how the uncertainties in these sub-questions affect the overall uncertainty of the main question.' d) Aggregation prompt: 'Based on the sub-question answers and the uncertainty propagation analysis, provide a final answer to the main question along with an overall confidence score from 0 to 100.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model as a comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods on all questions. b) Run the UCA method on all questions. c) For each method, collect the predicted answers, confidence scores, and any intermediate outputs (e.g., sub-questions for UCA).",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Compare the predicted answers with ground truth. b) Calibration Error: Calculate the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. c) Brier Score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. d) Spearman Correlation: Calculate the correlation between model confidence and human expert uncertainty judgments (we'll use a small subset of 100 questions per dataset for human evaluation).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare UCA performance against baselines across different datasets and models. b) Analyze how the decomposition quality affects final performance. c) Investigate cases where UCA significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines. d) Examine the relationship between sub-query uncertainties and final uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCA; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Break down this question into 3-5 simpler sub-questions that, when answered, would help solve the main question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCA; Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. What is the definition of a capital city?\n2. Is France a country?\n3. What is the largest and most important city in France?\n4. Where are the main government institutions of France located?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCA; Step 2: Sub-query Uncertainty Estimation)": "Answer this sub-question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: What is the definition of a capital city?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCA; Step 2: Sub-query Uncertainty Estimation)": "A capital city is the primary city of a country, usually serving as its political and administrative center where the government and major institutions are located. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCA; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Given the sub-questions, their answers, and confidence scores, explain how the uncertainties in these sub-questions affect the overall uncertainty of the main question 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCA; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "The uncertainties in the sub-questions have minimal impact on the overall uncertainty of the main question. The definition of a capital city (95% confidence) and the fact that France is a country (100% confidence) are well-established. The largest and most important city in France being Paris (98% confidence) and the location of main government institutions in Paris (99% confidence) strongly support the conclusion. The combined high confidence scores in these crucial sub-questions result in a very low overall uncertainty for the main question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UCA; Step 4: Aggregation)": "Based on the sub-question answers and the uncertainty propagation analysis, provide a final answer to the main question 'What is the capital of France?' along with an overall confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UCA; Step 4: Aggregation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Overall confidence score: 99",
            "explanation": "The UCA method provides a more nuanced and justified confidence score by breaking down the question into sub-components and analyzing the uncertainty of each. This process allows for a more robust estimation of uncertainty compared to the direct prompting method, which might give overly confident answers without proper justification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UCA method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the decomposition process, examining how different types of decompositions affect the final uncertainty estimates. This could lead to insights on how LLMs approach complex reasoning tasks. 2) Investigate the relationship between problem complexity and the effectiveness of UCA. We could categorize problems based on their complexity and analyze how UCA performs across these categories. 3) Explore different aggregation methods for combining sub-query uncertainties, such as weighted averages or more complex probabilistic models. 4) Analyze cases where UCA performs poorly and use these insights to develop a hybrid approach that combines UCA with other uncertainty estimation methods. These alternative directions could still yield valuable insights into LLM reasoning and uncertainty quantification, even if the original hypothesis isn't fully supported."
