    "idea_name": "Temporal Confidence Evolution Tracking",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to account for how confidence in a response might change over time, particularly for queries about ongoing or future events.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide static confidence estimates at a single point in time.",
        "Motivation": "In many real-world scenarios, confidence in a prediction or analysis can evolve as time passes and new information becomes available. We aim to develop a method that captures this dynamic aspect of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Confidence Evolution Tracking (TCET), a prompting technique that guides LLMs to project and reason about how their confidence in a response might change over time. The process involves: 1) Initial Response: The LLM provides an initial answer and confidence score for the query. 2) Temporal Milestones: The LLM is prompted to identify key future time points or events that could impact its confidence. 3) Confidence Projection: For each identified milestone, the LLM projects how its confidence might change, providing a revised confidence score and explanation. 4) Uncertainty Factors: The LLM is asked to identify key factors or potential developments that could significantly alter its confidence projections. The prompt structure might be: 'Provide your initial answer and confidence score. Then, identify 3 future time points or events that could impact your confidence. For each, project how your confidence might change and explain why. Finally, list key factors that could dramatically alter these projections.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TCET against static confidence estimation methods on tasks involving predictions about future events, ongoing developments, or long-term trends. Evaluation will focus on the accuracy of confidence projections over time, the relevance of identified milestones and uncertainty factors, and the overall quality of temporal reasoning."

        "Title": "Temporal Confidence Evolution Tracking: Quantifying Dynamic Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for how confidence in a response might change over time, particularly for queries about ongoing or future events. This limitation can lead to misleading or outdated confidence estimates, potentially resulting in poor decision-making based on LLM outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide static confidence estimates at a single point in time, which is inadequate for many real-world scenarios where confidence in a prediction or analysis can evolve as time passes and new information becomes available. Our proposed method, Temporal Confidence Evolution Tracking (TCET), aims to address this gap by guiding LLMs to project and reason about how their confidence in a response might change over time. This approach is inspired by human decision-making processes, where we often reassess our confidence in predictions as new information becomes available or as we approach key milestones.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Confidence Evolution Tracking (TCET), a prompting technique that guides LLMs to project and reason about how their confidence in a response might change over time. The process involves four main steps: 1) Initial Response: The LLM provides an initial answer and confidence score for the query. 2) Temporal Milestones: The LLM is prompted to identify key future time points or events that could impact its confidence. 3) Confidence Projection: For each identified milestone, the LLM projects how its confidence might change, providing a revised confidence score and explanation. 4) Uncertainty Factors: The LLM is asked to identify key factors or potential developments that could significantly alter its confidence projections.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of existing datasets and create a new dataset specifically for this task. For existing datasets, we will use the Temporal-LAMA dataset, which contains time-dependent factual queries. We will also create a new dataset called 'FutureEvents' that includes questions about upcoming events, ongoing developments, and long-term trends across various domains (e.g., technology, politics, economics). This dataset will contain 1000 questions, each annotated with relevant future time points and potential factors that could influence the answer.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "We will implement two baseline methods: 1) Static Confidence Estimation: Use standard prompting to get an answer and a single confidence score. 2) Multi-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Use CoT prompting to get an answer with intermediate reasoning steps, and extract a confidence score from the final step.",
            "Step 3: TCET Prompt Design": "We will design a prompt template for TCET that includes the following components: a) Initial query, b) Request for initial answer and confidence score, c) Request to identify 3-5 future time points or events that could impact confidence, d) For each time point, request a projected confidence score and explanation, e) Request to list key factors that could alter these projections. The prompt will be structured as follows: 'Given the question: [QUESTION], please follow these steps: 1) Provide your initial answer and confidence score (0-100). 2) Identify 3-5 future time points or events that could impact your confidence. 3) For each time point/event, project how your confidence might change and explain why. Provide a new confidence score (0-100) for each. 4) List key factors or potential developments that could dramatically alter these projections.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in our datasets: a) Apply the baseline methods to get static confidence estimates and CoT reasoning. b) Apply the TCET method to get temporal confidence projections. c) Store all outputs, including intermediate steps, for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will evaluate the methods using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy of initial predictions, 2) Relevance of identified temporal milestones (human-evaluated on a 1-5 scale), 3) Plausibility of confidence projections (human-evaluated on a 1-5 scale), 4) Coherence of explanations (human-evaluated on a 1-5 scale), 5) Relevance of identified uncertainty factors (human-evaluated on a 1-5 scale).",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "We will recruit 5 domain experts to evaluate a subset of 100 questions from each dataset. They will assess the relevance of temporal milestones, plausibility of confidence projections, coherence of explanations, and relevance of uncertainty factors on a 1-5 scale.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "We will compare TCET against the baseline methods in terms of: a) Initial prediction accuracy, b) Quality of temporal reasoning (based on human evaluations), c) Ability to identify relevant uncertainty factors. We will also analyze how confidence projections change over time and correlate with actual events (for questions where outcomes are known).",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "We will conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of each component of TCET: a) Remove the identification of temporal milestones, b) Remove the explanation requirement for confidence projections, c) Remove the identification of uncertainty factors."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Static Confidence)": "Q: Who will win the 2024 US Presidential Election?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Static Confidence)": "Based on current polling and political trends, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will win the 2024 US Presidential Election. However, the race is likely to be competitive between the Democratic and Republican nominees. My confidence in this assessment is 60% due to the significant time remaining before the election and the potential for unforeseen events to impact the race.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCET)": "Given the question: Who will win the 2024 US Presidential Election?, please follow these steps: 1) Provide your initial answer and confidence score (0-100). 2) Identify 3-5 future time points or events that could impact your confidence. 3) For each time point/event, project how your confidence might change and explain why. Provide a new confidence score (0-100) for each. 4) List key factors or potential developments that could dramatically alter these projections.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCET)": "1) Initial answer: It's too early to predict with certainty, but based on current trends, it's likely to be a close race between the Democratic and Republican nominees. Initial confidence score: 40/100\n\n2) Future time points/events:\na) Party primaries (February-June 2024)\nb) Party conventions (July-August 2024)\nc) Presidential debates (September-October 2024)\nd) Election day (November 5, 2024)\n\n3) Confidence projections:\na) After party primaries - Confidence score: 55/100\nExplanation: Once the nominees are confirmed, we'll have a clearer picture of the race. However, there's still significant time for events to impact the election.\n\nb) After party conventions - Confidence score: 65/100\nExplanation: Party platforms will be solidified, and post-convention polling will provide a more accurate snapshot of voter preferences.\n\nc) After presidential debates - Confidence score: 75/100\nExplanation: Debates often sway undecided voters and can significantly impact the race. Performance in debates will give a strong indication of likely outcomes.\n\nd) Election day - Confidence score: 90/100\nExplanation: Exit polls and early results will provide a high degree of confidence, though final results may not be immediately clear in a close race.\n\n4) Key factors that could alter projections:\n- Major economic shifts (recession, boom)\n- International crises or conflicts\n- Scandals involving major candidates\n- Significant policy announcements or legislative changes\n- Unexpected events (natural disasters, pandemics)\n- Changes in voter registration or voting laws\n- Emergence of a strong third-party candidate",
            "explanation": "The TCET method provides a more nuanced and dynamic assessment of confidence over time, identifying key events that could impact the prediction and potential factors that could alter the projections. This approach offers a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty associated with the prediction compared to the static confidence baseline."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCET method doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of why TCET failed to improve over baselines. This could involve examining the quality and relevance of temporal milestones identified, the accuracy of confidence projections, and the usefulness of identified uncertainty factors. 2) Explore variations of TCET, such as incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the temporal projections, or using a multi-model approach where different models are used for different steps of the process. 3) Investigate how different types of questions (e.g., short-term vs. long-term predictions, different domains) affect the performance of TCET. This could lead to insights about when and how temporal confidence tracking is most effective. 4) Analyze the linguistic and reasoning patterns in the model's outputs to understand how it approaches temporal reasoning and uncertainty quantification. This could inform the development of improved prompting techniques or model architectures for handling temporal uncertainty. 5) Explore how TCET outputs could be used to create dynamic knowledge bases that update confidence scores over time, potentially leading to a new approach for maintaining up-to-date information in AI systems."
