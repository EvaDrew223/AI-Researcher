        "Problem": "LLMs often provide a single confidence score, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current methods focus on extracting a single scalar confidence value from LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down uncertainty into distinct components (e.g., factual recall, reasoning steps, ambiguity in the question), we can obtain a more comprehensive and interpretable measure of an LLM's confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (UDP), where we guide the LLM to analyze its uncertainty across multiple dimensions. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Identify key components of uncertainty relevant to the task (e.g., factual knowledge, logical reasoning, linguistic ambiguity). 2) Provide a confidence score and justification for each component. 3) Explain potential interactions between these components. 4) Synthesize the component-wise uncertainties into an overall confidence estimate. We also include a step where the LLM generates hypothetical scenarios that would increase or decrease its confidence in each component.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare UDP against standard confidence elicitation methods on a diverse set of tasks including multi-hop reasoning, ambiguous questions, and tasks requiring both factual recall and logical inference. Evaluate the method's ability to provide more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty estimates, as well as its performance on calibration metrics."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single confidence score, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of uncertainty in complex tasks. This oversimplification can lead to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones, potentially limiting the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods primarily focus on extracting a single scalar confidence value from LLMs, which doesn't adequately represent the nuanced nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. By breaking down uncertainty into distinct components (e.g., factual recall, reasoning steps, ambiguity in the question), we can obtain a more comprehensive and interpretable measure of an LLM's confidence. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often assess our confidence across multiple dimensions when tackling complex problems. Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (UDP) aims to leverage the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to provide a more nuanced and accurate representation of its confidence, potentially leading to better calibrated and more reliable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (UDP), a multi-step prompting approach that guides the LLM to analyze its uncertainty across multiple dimensions. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Identify key components of uncertainty relevant to the task (e.g., factual knowledge, logical reasoning, linguistic ambiguity). 2) Provide a confidence score and justification for each component. 3) Explain potential interactions between these components. 4) Synthesize the component-wise uncertainties into an overall confidence estimate. 5) Generate hypothetical scenarios that would increase or decrease confidence in each component. This approach aims to produce a more comprehensive and interpretable measure of an LLM's confidence, potentially leading to better calibrated outputs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks to evaluate UDP: a) Multi-hop reasoning: HotpotQA dataset. b) Ambiguous questions: AmbigQA dataset. c) Tasks requiring both factual recall and logical inference: TruthfulQA dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. b) Calibrated confidence: Use temperature scaling on the output logits to obtain calibrated probabilities. c) Uncertainty-aware prompting: Use prompts that encourage the model to express uncertainty, e.g., 'If you're not sure, it's okay to say so.'",
            "Step 3: UDP Implementation": "Implement UDP with the following steps for each question: a) Component Identification: Prompt the LLM to identify 3-5 key uncertainty components relevant to the question. b) Component-wise Confidence: For each component, prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification. c) Component Interactions: Prompt the LLM to explain how these components might interact or influence each other. d) Overall Confidence Synthesis: Prompt the LLM to synthesize an overall confidence score based on the component-wise analysis. e) Hypothetical Scenarios: Prompt the LLM to generate scenarios that would increase or decrease confidence in each component.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of UDP compared to baselines: a) Calibration error: Measure the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) ECE (Expected Calibration Error): Measure the difference between confidence and accuracy in bins. d) Spearman's rank correlation: Assess the correlation between confidence scores and correctness of answers.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect confidence scores and answers. b) Implement UDP and collect decomposed confidence scores, component analyses, and final answers. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and UDP methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare UDP performance against baselines across different tasks and models. b) Analyze the identified uncertainty components and their relevance to each task. c) Examine how component-wise confidence scores contribute to the overall confidence estimate. d) Investigate cases where UDP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Marie Curie was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. She won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 1: Component Identification)": "Q: Who was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields? Identify 3-5 key components of uncertainty relevant to answering this question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 1: Component Identification)": "1. Factual recall of Nobel Prize winners\n2. Knowledge of scientific fields and their distinctions\n3. Understanding of the chronology of Nobel Prizes\n4. Awareness of potential exceptions or edge cases",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 2: Component-wise Confidence)": "For each identified component, provide a confidence score (0-100) and a brief justification:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 2: Component-wise Confidence)": "1. Factual recall of Nobel Prize winners - Confidence: 90\nJustification: I have strong recall of Marie Curie winning multiple Nobel Prizes, but there's a small chance I might be overlooking someone.\n2. Knowledge of scientific fields and their distinctions - Confidence: 95\nJustification: I'm very confident in distinguishing between major scientific fields like Physics and Chemistry.\n3. Understanding of the chronology of Nobel Prizes - Confidence: 85\nJustification: I'm fairly confident about the general timeline of early Nobel Prizes, but exact years might be slightly uncertain.\n4. Awareness of potential exceptions or edge cases - Confidence: 80\nJustification: While I believe Marie Curie is the correct answer, there's a possibility of an obscure exception I'm not aware of.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 3: Component Interactions)": "Explain how these components might interact or influence each other in determining the answer and overall confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 3: Component Interactions)": "The factual recall of Nobel Prize winners interacts closely with the understanding of chronology, as knowing who won prizes in what order is crucial for identifying the 'first person'. The knowledge of scientific fields is important to ensure the prizes were indeed in different fields. The awareness of potential exceptions acts as a moderating factor on the overall confidence, acknowledging that even with strong recall and understanding, there might be unknown factors at play.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 4: Overall Confidence Synthesis)": "Based on the component-wise analysis and their interactions, synthesize an overall confidence score for the answer to the original question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 4: Overall Confidence Synthesis)": "Overall Confidence Score: 88\nJustification: While I have high confidence in my factual recall and understanding of scientific fields, the slightly lower confidence in chronology and the awareness of potential exceptions slightly reduce the overall confidence. The strong interaction between factual recall and chronology understanding supports a high confidence, but I'm accounting for the small possibility of overlooking an exception.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDP Step 5: Hypothetical Scenarios)": "Generate scenarios that would increase or decrease your confidence in each component of the answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDP Step 5: Hypothetical Scenarios)": "1. Factual recall: Confidence would increase if I could cross-reference with a comprehensive list of multiple Nobel Prize winners. It would decrease if I learned of other scientists who won multiple prizes that I wasn't previously aware of.\n2. Scientific fields: Confidence would increase if I reviewed the exact definitions of Nobel Prize categories. It would decrease if I discovered there were significant changes in how fields were categorized over time.\n3. Chronology: Confidence would increase if I had access to a timeline of all multiple Nobel Prize winners. It would decrease if I found conflicting information about the years of Marie Curie's prizes.\n4. Exceptions: Confidence would increase if I could verify that no other scientist won multiple prizes in different fields before Marie Curie. It would decrease if I discovered debates or controversies about who should be considered the 'first' in this context.",
            "Explanation": "UDP provides a more nuanced and interpretable confidence assessment compared to the baseline. It breaks down the uncertainty into specific components, analyzes their interactions, and considers potential scenarios that could affect confidence. This approach allows for a more robust and justifiable confidence score, potentially leading to better calibrated outputs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UDP doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the uncertainty components identified by the LLM across different tasks. This could provide insights into how LLMs conceptualize uncertainty and potentially inform future prompting strategies. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or tasks benefit more from UDP than others, which could lead to a hybrid approach where UDP is selectively applied. 3) Analyze cases where UDP performs poorly to identify potential weaknesses in the method, such as overthinking simple questions or introducing unnecessary complexity. 4) Explore variations of UDP, such as iterative refinement of uncertainty components or incorporating external knowledge sources to validate component-wise confidence. 5) Investigate how UDP affects the actual answers generated, not just the confidence scores, to see if it leads to more accurate or nuanced responses. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the relationship between decomposed uncertainty and answer quality in LLMs."
