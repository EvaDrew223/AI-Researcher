        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often fail to capture the structural relationships between concepts and facts in the model's latent knowledge, leading to inconsistent uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on output probabilities, ensemble disagreement, or direct confidence elicitation.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by cognitive science theories of human knowledge organization and recent work on probing language models, we propose that uncertainty can be more accurately estimated by explicitly probing the LLM's latent knowledge graph structure.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Latent Knowledge Graph Probing for Uncertainty Estimation (LKGPUE). Given a query, we first use the LLM to generate a set of related concepts and facts. We then construct a series of probing questions to test the relationships between these elements (e.g., hierarchical, causal, temporal). The LLM's responses are used to build a weighted graph representing its latent knowledge structure relevant to the query. Uncertainty is estimated based on graph properties such as connectivity, edge weights, and the presence of contradictory paths. High uncertainty is indicated by weakly connected or contradictory subgraphs, while low uncertainty corresponds to densely connected, consistent subgraphs.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare LKGPUE with baseline uncertainty estimation methods on tasks such as factual question answering, causal reasoning, and temporal event ordering. Evaluate using metrics like calibration error, uncertainty ranking correlation with human judgments, and performance on downstream tasks that rely on accurate uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Latent Knowledge Graph Probing for Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the structural relationships between concepts and facts in the model's latent knowledge, leading to inconsistent uncertainty estimates. This problem is particularly important as accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for safe and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on output probabilities, ensemble disagreement, or direct confidence elicitation, which do not fully leverage the rich structural information in LLMs' latent knowledge. Inspired by cognitive science theories of human knowledge organization and recent work on probing language models, we propose that uncertainty can be more accurately estimated by explicitly probing the LLM's latent knowledge graph structure. This approach has the potential to provide more nuanced and contextually relevant uncertainty estimates by considering the relationships between concepts and facts, rather than treating each prediction in isolation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Latent Knowledge Graph Probing for Uncertainty Estimation (LKGPUE). Given a query, we first use the LLM to generate a set of related concepts and facts. We then construct a series of probing questions to test the relationships between these elements (e.g., hierarchical, causal, temporal). The LLM's responses are used to build a weighted graph representing its latent knowledge structure relevant to the query. Uncertainty is estimated based on graph properties such as connectivity, edge weights, and the presence of contradictory paths. High uncertainty is indicated by weakly connected or contradictory subgraphs, while low uncertainty corresponds to densely connected, consistent subgraphs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) COPA for causal reasoning, and (3) TimeQA for temporal event ordering. These datasets cover a range of reasoning types and have ground truth labels for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation methods: (1) Softmax probability, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (3) Ensemble disagreement using different few-shot prompts. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs for these baselines.",
            "Step 3: LKGPUE Implementation": "Implement the proposed LKGPUE method with the following sub-steps: (a) Concept generation: Given a query, prompt the LLM to generate related concepts and facts. (b) Probing question generation: Create a set of questions to test relationships between the generated concepts. (c) Graph construction: Use the LLM's responses to build a weighted knowledge graph. (d) Uncertainty estimation: Develop algorithms to compute uncertainty based on graph properties.",
            "Step 4: Experimental Setup": "For each dataset and method (baselines and LKGPUE), perform the following: (a) Generate uncertainty estimates for each test example. (b) Compute evaluation metrics: calibration error, Brier score, and AUC-ROC for detecting correct vs. incorrect predictions. (c) Conduct human evaluation on a subset of examples to assess the quality and interpretability of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 5: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare LKGPUE with baselines across all datasets and metrics. Perform ablation studies on different graph properties used for uncertainty estimation. Analyze cases where LKGPUE performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines.",
            "Step 6: Downstream Task Evaluation": "Implement a simple decision-making system that uses uncertainty estimates to decide whether to trust the LLM's output or seek human intervention. Compare the performance of this system using LKGPUE vs. baseline uncertainty estimates."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Softmax Probability Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong, Confidence: 0.92",
                "Monte Carlo Dropout Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong, Confidence: 0.89 \u00b1 0.03",
                "Ensemble Disagreement Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong, Confidence: 0.95 (9/10 agreement)"
            },
            "LKGPUE Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Step 1 (Concept Generation)": "Prompt: Generate a list of related concepts and facts for the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'\nOutput: 1. Apollo 11 mission, 2. NASA, 3. Neil Armstrong, 4. Buzz Aldrin, 5. Michael Collins, 6. July 20, 1969, 7. Lunar Module Eagle, 8. 'One small step for man' quote, 9. Space Race, 10. Cold War",
                "Step 2 (Probing Question Generation)": "Prompt: Generate probing questions to test relationships between the concepts related to the first moon landing.\nOutput: 1. What was the name of the NASA mission that first landed humans on the moon? 2. Who were the three astronauts on this mission? 3. Which astronaut stayed in the command module and didn't walk on the moon? 4. On what date did the moon landing occur? 5. What famous quote is associated with the first step on the moon? 6. How does the moon landing relate to the Space Race and Cold War?",
                "Step 3 (Graph Construction)": "Use the LLM to answer the probing questions and construct a weighted graph based on the consistency and confidence of the answers.",
                "Step 4 (Uncertainty Estimation)": "Analyze the graph properties: High connectivity between Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong, and the moon landing date. Strong agreement on Neil Armstrong as the first person on the moon. Some uncertainty about the exact roles of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.\nFinal output: Answer: Neil Armstrong, Uncertainty: Low (0.15 on a 0-1 scale)"
            },
            "Explanation": "The LKGPUE method provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by considering the relationships between multiple related concepts and facts. It can capture uncertainties in specific aspects (e.g., roles of other astronauts) while maintaining high confidence in the main answer. This structural approach potentially offers more informative and reliable uncertainty estimates compared to the scalar values from baseline methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If LKGPUE doesn't outperform baselines as expected, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated knowledge graphs to gain insights into how LLMs structure knowledge and where uncertainties arise. This could lead to a paper on LLM knowledge representation rather than uncertainty estimation. Second, we could investigate hybrid approaches that combine LKGPUE with traditional methods, potentially achieving better performance through complementary strengths. Finally, we could explore using the generated knowledge graphs for other tasks beyond uncertainty estimation, such as improving multi-hop reasoning or fact-checking, turning the project into a more general study on leveraging latent knowledge structures in LLMs."
