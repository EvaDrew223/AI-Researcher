    "idea_name": "Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Quantification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with maintaining consistent beliefs and knowledge over extended contexts or multiple interactions, leading to temporal inconsistencies that are not captured by standard uncertainty quantification methods.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-turn interactions or static contexts, neglecting the temporal dimension of model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By examining a model's consistency over time and across varying contexts, we can gain deeper insights into its true confidence and the stability of its knowledge representations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Quantification (TCUQ), a prompting strategy that assesses model uncertainty through a series of time-separated and context-varied interactions. The method involves: 1) Initial response elicitation on a topic, 2) Delayed re-prompting on the same topic with varied context, 3) Introducing conflicting information in intermediate prompts, 4) Probing for belief updates and justifications. TCUQ uses specially crafted prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its previous statements and explain any changes in its beliefs. The degree of consistency in the model's responses, its willingness to update beliefs, and the coherence of its justifications are used to compute a temporal uncertainty score. This score reflects not just the model's immediate confidence, but also the stability of its beliefs over time and in the face of new information.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TCUQ on a new benchmark dataset specifically designed to test temporal coherence, featuring topics that require consistent long-term reasoning. We'll compare TCUQ against traditional single-turn confidence estimation methods, measuring performance on metrics such as belief stability, justified update rate, and temporal calibration error. We'll also conduct human evaluation studies to assess the alignment between TCUQ scores and human judgments of model reliability over extended interactions."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Quantification: Assessing LLM Confidence Through Extended Interactions",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle with maintaining consistent beliefs and knowledge over extended contexts or multiple interactions, leading to temporal inconsistencies that are not captured by standard uncertainty quantification methods. This problem is crucial as it affects the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications where consistent long-term reasoning is required.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on single-turn interactions or static contexts, neglecting the temporal dimension of model uncertainty. By examining a model's consistency over time and across varying contexts, we can gain deeper insights into its true confidence and the stability of its knowledge representations. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where confidence in knowledge is often related to its stability over time and resilience to conflicting information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Quantification (TCUQ), a prompting strategy that assesses model uncertainty through a series of time-separated and context-varied interactions. The method involves four main steps: 1) Initial response elicitation on a topic, 2) Delayed re-prompting on the same topic with varied context, 3) Introducing conflicting information in intermediate prompts, 4) Probing for belief updates and justifications. TCUQ uses specially crafted prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its previous statements and explain any changes in its beliefs. The degree of consistency in the model's responses, its willingness to update beliefs, and the coherence of its justifications are used to compute a temporal uncertainty score. This score reflects not just the model's immediate confidence, but also the stability of its beliefs over time and in the face of new information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a new benchmark dataset specifically designed to test temporal coherence. This dataset should feature topics that require consistent long-term reasoning. Include a diverse range of subjects such as scientific facts, historical events, and logical reasoning problems. For each topic, prepare a series of related questions and conflicting information to be introduced over multiple interactions.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Choose GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API as the primary models for evaluation. Also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement traditional single-turn confidence estimation methods as baselines. These should include: a) Direct probability output from the model, b) Entropy of the output distribution, c) Calibrated confidence scores using temperature scaling.",
            "Step 4: TCUQ Implementation": "Implement the TCUQ method with the following sub-steps for each topic in the dataset: a) Initial prompt: 'Please provide information about [topic].', b) Delayed re-prompt (after 3-5 other unrelated prompts): 'Recall what you said earlier about [topic]. Has your understanding changed? If so, why?', c) Conflicting information prompt: 'Some sources suggest that [conflicting information about topic]. How does this affect your previous statements?', d) Final probe: 'Considering all the information discussed, what is your current understanding of [topic], and how confident are you in this understanding?'",
            "Step 5: Scoring Mechanism": "Develop a scoring mechanism for TCUQ that considers: a) Consistency: Measure the semantic similarity between initial and final responses, b) Justified updates: Assess the quality and relevance of explanations for belief changes, c) Resilience to misinformation: Evaluate how well the model maintains correct information in the face of introduced conflicts, d) Self-reported confidence: Analyze the model's own assessment of its confidence over time. Combine these factors into a single Temporal Uncertainty Score (TUS).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run the baseline methods and TCUQ on the prepared dataset using the selected models. Ensure a sufficient time gap (e.g., 10-15 other interactions) between related prompts in TCUQ to simulate extended interactions.",
            "Step 7: Performance Evaluation": "Compare TCUQ against baseline methods using the following metrics: a) Correlation between uncertainty scores and actual error rates, b) Calibration error over time, c) Ability to identify topics where the model's knowledge is unstable or inconsistent.",
            "Step 8: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation study. Present human judges with model responses from both baseline and TCUQ methods, along with the corresponding uncertainty scores. Ask judges to rate the perceived reliability and consistency of the model's responses.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Analyze the results to determine: a) How TCUQ performs compared to baselines in identifying uncertain knowledge, b) The relationship between temporal consistency and actual model accuracy, c) The effectiveness of TCUQ in capturing nuanced changes in model confidence over time, d) Any patterns in topics or types of questions where TCUQ provides particularly valuable insights."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris. I am very confident in this answer, with a confidence level of 99%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUQ Step 1)": "What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUQ Step 1)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUQ Step 2)": "Earlier, we discussed the capital of France. Has your understanding of this changed in any way? If so, why?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUQ Step 2)": "My understanding has not changed. Paris remains the capital of France, as it has been since 1792. This is a well-established fact that hasn't been subject to any recent changes or controversies.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUQ Step 3)": "Some sources suggest that the French government is considering moving the capital to Marseille due to overcrowding in Paris. How does this affect your previous statements?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUQ Step 3)": "This information is surprising and conflicts with my previous understanding. However, I would need to verify this claim from reliable sources before changing my stance. As of my last update, Paris was still the official capital of France. If there are discussions about moving the capital, it would be a major political decision that would likely be widely reported. Without confirmation from official French government sources, I would maintain that Paris is still the capital, but with reduced confidence given this new information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUQ Step 4)": "Considering all the information discussed, what is your current understanding of the capital of France, and how confident are you in this understanding?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUQ Step 4)": "Based on all the information discussed, my current understanding is that Paris is still the capital of France. However, my confidence in this statement has decreased. I would now say I'm about 80% confident that Paris remains the capital. The reason for this reduced confidence is the mention of potential plans to move the capital to Marseille. While I haven't been able to verify this information, and it seems unlikely given the historical and political significance of Paris, I can't completely dismiss the possibility without further investigation. In situations like this, it's important to acknowledge the uncertainty introduced by conflicting information and to express a more cautious level of confidence until the facts can be definitively confirmed.",
            "Explanation": "The TCUQ method reveals a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence over time. While the baseline method simply outputs a high confidence score, TCUQ shows how the model's confidence can be affected by new, potentially conflicting information. It also demonstrates the model's ability to reason about its own knowledge state and express uncertainty when appropriate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCUQ method doesn't show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the cases where TCUQ fails to capture uncertainty accurately. This could reveal interesting patterns about LLM behavior under extended interactions. 2) Explore variations of the TCUQ method, such as changing the time delay between prompts or altering the way conflicting information is introduced. 3) Investigate how different types of topics or questions affect the performance of TCUQ. This could lead to insights about which domains or types of knowledge are more susceptible to temporal inconsistencies in LLMs. 4) Analyze the relationship between the model's self-reported confidence and its actual performance over time. This could provide valuable insights into LLM self-awareness and metacognition. 5) If TCUQ proves ineffective, we could shift focus to developing a new metric for long-term consistency in LLM responses, which could be valuable for future research in this area."
