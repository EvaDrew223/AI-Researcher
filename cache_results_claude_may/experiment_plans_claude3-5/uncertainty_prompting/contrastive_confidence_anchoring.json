    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across diverse tasks and domains, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in their outputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on fine-tuning with labeled calibration data or using ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often assess their confidence by comparing a current task to known reference points. We can leverage this idea to improve LLM calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Anchoring (CCA), a prompting method that uses a set of carefully curated 'anchor tasks' with known difficulty levels. For a given query, we prompt the LLM to compare the current task to these anchor tasks in terms of difficulty and confidence. The prompt includes descriptions of the anchor tasks, their difficulty levels, and asks the model to position the current task relative to these anchors. This comparative process helps the model calibrate its confidence more accurately. The final confidence is derived from the model's positioning of the current task among the anchors.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCA against standard confidence elicitation methods on a diverse set of tasks including factual QA, reasoning problems, and open-ended generation. Measure performance using calibration metrics and test generalization to out-of-distribution tasks."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Anchoring: Improving LLM Calibration through Comparative Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across diverse tasks and domains, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in their outputs. This miscalibration can result in unreliable predictions and potentially harmful decision-making when LLMs are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for improving LLM calibration typically rely on fine-tuning with labeled calibration data or using ensemble methods, which can be resource-intensive and may not generalize well across different tasks. Inspired by human cognitive processes, where individuals often assess their confidence by comparing a current task to known reference points, we propose a novel prompting method that leverages this comparative approach to improve LLM calibration without the need for additional training or model modifications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Anchoring (CCA), a prompting method that uses a set of carefully curated 'anchor tasks' with known difficulty levels. For a given query, we prompt the LLM to compare the current task to these anchor tasks in terms of difficulty and confidence. The prompt includes descriptions of the anchor tasks, their difficulty levels, and asks the model to position the current task relative to these anchors. This comparative process helps the model calibrate its confidence more accurately. The final confidence is derived from the model's positioning of the current task among the anchors.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Prepare Anchor Tasks": "Create a set of 5-10 anchor tasks covering a range of difficulty levels (e.g., very easy, easy, moderate, difficult, very difficult) across various domains (e.g., general knowledge, math, reasoning). For each anchor task, provide a brief description and assign a difficulty score on a scale of 1-10.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "Design the CCA prompt template, which should include: (1) Instructions for the model to compare the given task to the anchor tasks, (2) Descriptions of the anchor tasks and their difficulty levels, (3) The current task to be solved, (4) A request for the model to position the current task among the anchors and provide a confidence score.",
            "Step 3: Select Datasets": "Choose diverse datasets for evaluation, including: (1) TriviaQA for factual QA, (2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, (3) MMLU for multi-task evaluation, and (4) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 4: Select Models": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for the experiments.",
            "Step 5: Implement Baselines": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: Ask the model to solve the task and provide a confidence score directly, (2) Calibrated few-shot prompting: Include a few examples of solved tasks with accurate confidence scores before the target task.",
            "Step 6: Run Experiments": "For each dataset and model combination: (1) Apply the CCA method and both baselines to generate answers and confidence scores for all tasks, (2) Record the model's outputs, including intermediate comparisons for CCA.",
            "Step 7: Evaluate Results": "Calculate the following metrics for each method: (1) Task performance (e.g., accuracy, F1 score), (2) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score, (3) Confidence distribution statistics.",
            "Step 8: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of CCA against the baselines across different tasks and models. Investigate how the method performs on in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution tasks. Analyze the relationship between task difficulty, model confidence, and actual performance.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of CCA: (1) Vary the number of anchor tasks, (2) Experiment with different difficulty distributions of anchor tasks, (3) Test the effect of domain-specific vs. general anchor tasks."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCA)": "Consider the following anchor tasks with their difficulty levels:\n1. Name the current U.S. President (Difficulty: 1/10)\n2. Solve 2 + 2 (Difficulty: 1/10)\n3. Name all planets in the solar system (Difficulty: 4/10)\n4. Explain quantum entanglement (Difficulty: 9/10)\n5. Prove the Riemann Hypothesis (Difficulty: 10/10)\n\nNow, compare the following question to these anchor tasks in terms of difficulty and your confidence in answering it correctly:\n\nQ: What is the capital of France?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Your answer to the question\n2. A comparison of this question's difficulty to the anchor tasks\n3. Your confidence level (0-100) in your answer, justified by the comparison",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCA)": "1. Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\n\n2. Comparison: This question is most similar in difficulty to anchor tasks 1 and 2. It's a very basic fact that is widely known and taught in elementary geography. I would place its difficulty at 1/10, equivalent to the easiest anchor tasks.\n\n3. Confidence: 98/100. My confidence is very high because this is an extremely well-known fact, comparable to knowing the current U.S. President or solving a simple addition problem. The question doesn't require any complex reasoning or specialized knowledge, making it one of the easiest possible geography questions. While I rarely claim 100% confidence to allow for the minimal possibility of a mistake, I am nearly certain of this answer.",
            "Explanation": "The CCA method prompts the model to explicitly compare the given task to a range of anchor tasks with known difficulty levels. This process encourages the model to calibrate its confidence more accurately by providing reference points and requiring justification for its confidence level. In contrast, the direct prompting method may lead to overconfidence or arbitrary confidence scores without proper calibration."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CCA method doesn't significantly improve calibration compared to baselines, we can explore several alternative directions: 1) Analyze the model's comparisons to anchor tasks to understand if the issue lies in the comparison process or in translating comparisons to confidence scores. This could lead to refinements in the anchor task selection or prompt design. 2) Investigate whether certain types of tasks or domains benefit more from CCA, which could inform a hybrid approach combining CCA with other methods for different task types. 3) Explore iterative CCA, where the model's initial confidence is used to select a more focused set of anchor tasks for a second round of comparison, potentially improving calibration for edge cases. 4) If CCA shows promise but falls short of expectations, we could pivot to a comparative analysis paper, examining how different LLMs perform in relative difficulty assessments and what this reveals about their reasoning capabilities and limitations in self-evaluation."
