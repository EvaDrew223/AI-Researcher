        "Problem": "Language models often fail to adequately express uncertainty for complex queries that require multi-step reasoning or integration of multiple knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess uncertainty only on the final output, missing potential compounding of uncertainties in intermediate reasoning steps.",
        "Motivation": "By recursively quantifying and amplifying uncertainties at each step of a complex reasoning process, we can achieve more accurate overall uncertainty estimation for challenging queries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Uncertainty Amplification (RUA), a prompting technique that guides the model through a step-by-step reasoning process while explicitly tracking and amplifying uncertainties. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Break down the query into a series of reasoning steps. 2) For each step, provide an intermediate conclusion and an associated uncertainty estimate. 3) Propagate and amplify uncertainties from previous steps when making new inferences. 4) Synthesize a final response that incorporates the cumulative uncertainties from all reasoning steps. This approach allows for more nuanced uncertainty quantification in complex reasoning tasks and helps identify specific steps where uncertainty arises.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RUA against standard prompting and chain-of-thought approaches on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH. Evaluate the calibration and informativeness of uncertainty estimates at both intermediate and final steps. Analyze how uncertainties propagate and compound through the reasoning process."

        "Title": "Recursive Uncertainty Amplification: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Language models often fail to adequately express uncertainty for complex queries that require multi-step reasoning or integration of multiple knowledge domains. Current approaches typically assess uncertainty only on the final output, missing potential compounding of uncertainties in intermediate reasoning steps.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in language models often focus on the final output, neglecting the accumulation of uncertainties throughout the reasoning process. This approach can lead to overconfident or miscalibrated uncertainty estimates, especially for complex tasks involving multiple reasoning steps. By recursively quantifying and amplifying uncertainties at each step of a complex reasoning process, we can achieve more accurate overall uncertainty estimation for challenging queries. This method aligns more closely with human reasoning, where we often recognize and account for uncertainties at various stages of problem-solving.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Uncertainty Amplification (RUA), a prompting technique that guides the model through a step-by-step reasoning process while explicitly tracking and amplifying uncertainties. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Break down the query into a series of reasoning steps. 2) For each step, provide an intermediate conclusion and an associated uncertainty estimate. 3) Propagate and amplify uncertainties from previous steps when making new inferences. 4) Synthesize a final response that incorporates the cumulative uncertainties from all reasoning steps. This approach allows for more nuanced uncertainty quantification in complex reasoning tasks and helps identify specific steps where uncertainty arises.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets are suitable for evaluating multi-step reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting: Directly ask the model to solve the problem and provide a confidence score. b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use the standard CoT prompt and ask for a final confidence score. c) Calibrated CoT: Implement the method from Kadavath et al. (2022) that calibrates confidence scores post-hoc.",
            "Step 3: RUA Prompt Design": "Design the RUA prompt template. It should include instructions for: a) Breaking down the problem into steps. b) Providing intermediate conclusions with uncertainty estimates. c) Propagating uncertainties to subsequent steps. d) Synthesizing a final answer with cumulative uncertainty. Example prompt: 'Solve this problem step by step. For each step, provide your reasoning, an intermediate conclusion, and an uncertainty estimate (0-100%). In subsequent steps, consider and amplify uncertainties from previous steps. Finally, provide a synthesized answer with an overall uncertainty estimate.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities and are suitable for complex prompting strategies.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each problem in the datasets: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their outputs and confidence scores. b) Apply the RUA method and record the step-by-step reasoning, intermediate uncertainties, and final output with cumulative uncertainty. c) Repeat each method 5 times to account for output variability.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Accuracy: Percentage of correctly solved problems. b) Calibration error: Measure the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. c) Uncertainty resolution: Assess how well the model's uncertainty estimates distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. d) Step-wise uncertainty correlation: Analyze how intermediate uncertainties correlate with final answer correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare the performance of RUA against baselines in terms of accuracy and uncertainty quantification. b) Analyze how uncertainties propagate and compound through the reasoning process in RUA. c) Identify patterns in which types of problems or reasoning steps tend to produce higher uncertainties. d) Evaluate whether RUA leads to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: James has 5 apples. He buys 3 more apples and then gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does James have now? Also, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "James has 6 apples now. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUA Prompting)": "Q: James has 5 apples. He buys 3 more apples and then gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does James have now? Solve this problem step by step. For each step, provide your reasoning, an intermediate conclusion, and an uncertainty estimate (0-100%). In subsequent steps, consider and amplify uncertainties from previous steps. Finally, provide a synthesized answer with an overall uncertainty estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUA Prompting)": "Step 1: Initial number of apples\nReasoning: James starts with 5 apples.\nIntermediate conclusion: James has 5 apples initially.\nUncertainty: 0% (This is given in the problem statement)\n\nStep 2: Buying more apples\nReasoning: James buys 3 more apples. We need to add this to his initial number.\nIntermediate conclusion: James now has 5 + 3 = 8 apples.\nUncertainty: 1% (Simple addition, but considering a small chance of calculation error)\n\nStep 3: Giving apples to his friend\nReasoning: James gives 2 apples to his friend. We need to subtract this from his current total.\nIntermediate conclusion: James now has 8 - 2 = 6 apples.\nUncertainty: 2% (Carrying over 1% uncertainty from previous step, and adding 1% for this calculation)\n\nFinal synthesized answer: James has 6 apples now.\nOverall uncertainty estimate: 2%\n\nExplanation: The overall uncertainty remains low because each step involves simple arithmetic with small numbers. The slight increase in uncertainty accounts for the potential for human-like errors in calculation or misreading the problem statement.",
            "explanation": "The RUA method provides a more detailed breakdown of the reasoning process, explicitly quantifying uncertainties at each step. This allows for a more nuanced final uncertainty estimate that takes into account the complexity of the problem-solving process. In contrast, the standard prompting method gives a single high confidence score without justification, which may not accurately reflect the true uncertainty in more complex problems."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RUA method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Examining individual cases where RUA performs poorly to identify patterns or specific types of reasoning that challenge the method. 2) Analyzing the relationship between intermediate and final uncertainties to see if the propagation mechanism needs refinement. 3) Experimenting with different uncertainty aggregation methods (e.g., max uncertainty, weighted average) to see if they better capture the compounding of uncertainties. 4) Investigating whether the method is more effective for certain types of problems or reasoning steps, which could lead to a hybrid approach combining RUA with other methods. 5) Conducting an ablation study to determine which components of RUA contribute most to its performance, potentially leading to a simplified or modified version of the method. If these analyses do not yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth study of how language models represent and propagate uncertainty in multi-step reasoning, which could provide valuable insights for future uncertainty quantification methods."
