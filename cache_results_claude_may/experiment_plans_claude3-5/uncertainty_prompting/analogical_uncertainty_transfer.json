        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty for questions in unfamiliar domains or contexts, even when they might have relevant knowledge from analogous situations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current uncertainty quantification methods typically don't leverage the model's ability to draw analogies between different domains or situations to inform confidence estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often gauge their confidence in unfamiliar situations by drawing parallels to more familiar contexts. We aim to enable LLMs to similarly leverage analogical reasoning to improve uncertainty estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Analogical Uncertainty Transfer (AUT), a prompting technique that involves: 1) Identifying key features of the given question and domain. 2) Generating analogous questions in more familiar domains that share similar structural features. 3) Estimating confidence and providing answers for these analogous questions. 4) Analyzing similarities and differences between the original and analogous questions. 5) Transferring and adapting uncertainty estimates from the analogous cases to the original question. 6) Synthesizing a final answer and confidence estimate informed by this analogical analysis. This method encourages the model to ground its uncertainty estimation in more familiar territory, potentially leading to more accurate calibration in novel contexts.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate AUT against standard confidence estimation techniques on cross-domain question-answering datasets and newly constructed benchmarks designed to test uncertainty estimation in unfamiliar contexts. We'll measure both answer accuracy and the quality of uncertainty estimates, with a particular focus on performance in novel domains."

        "Title": "Analogical Uncertainty Transfer: Improving LLM Confidence Calibration through Cross-Domain Reasoning",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty for questions in unfamiliar domains or contexts, even when they might have relevant knowledge from analogous situations. This leads to poor calibration of confidence estimates, potentially resulting in unreliable or misleading outputs in novel scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs typically don't leverage the model's ability to draw analogies between different domains or situations to inform confidence estimates. Humans often gauge their confidence in unfamiliar situations by drawing parallels to more familiar contexts. By enabling LLMs to similarly leverage analogical reasoning, we aim to improve uncertainty estimation, particularly in novel or cross-domain scenarios. This approach could lead to more reliable and better-calibrated LLM outputs across a wider range of applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Analogical Uncertainty Transfer (AUT), a prompting technique that involves six key steps: 1) Identifying key features of the given question and domain. 2) Generating analogous questions in more familiar domains that share similar structural features. 3) Estimating confidence and providing answers for these analogous questions. 4) Analyzing similarities and differences between the original and analogous questions. 5) Transferring and adapting uncertainty estimates from the analogous cases to the original question. 6) Synthesizing a final answer and confidence estimate informed by this analogical analysis. This method encourages the model to ground its uncertainty estimation in more familiar territory, potentially leading to more accurate calibration in novel contexts.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of cross-domain question-answering datasets. Include: a) Existing datasets like TruthfulQA, TriviaQA, and SciQ. b) Create a new benchmark specifically designed to test uncertainty estimation in unfamiliar contexts by combining questions from various specialized domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques: a) Direct prompting with confidence request. b) Monte Carlo Dropout. c) Ensemble methods using different model checkpoints or temperatures.",
            "Step 3: AUT Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the AUT process: a) Feature identification prompt: 'Identify the key features and domain of this question: [QUESTION]' b) Analogous question generation prompt: 'Generate 3 analogous questions from more familiar domains that share structural similarities with this question: [QUESTION]' c) Confidence estimation prompt for analogous questions: 'Provide an answer and confidence estimate (0-100%) for each of these questions: [ANALOGOUS_QUESTIONS]' d) Similarity analysis prompt: 'Analyze the similarities and differences between the original question and the analogous questions: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION] [ANALOGOUS_QUESTIONS]' e) Uncertainty transfer prompt: 'Based on the confidence estimates for the analogous questions and their similarities to the original question, estimate the confidence for the original question: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION] [ANALOGOUS_QA_WITH_CONFIDENCE]' f) Final synthesis prompt: 'Provide a final answer and confidence estimate for the original question, incorporating the analogical analysis: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION] [FULL_ANALOGICAL_ANALYSIS]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Also include open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Apply baseline methods to get answers and confidence estimates. b) Apply AUT method, executing each step sequentially. c) Record answers, confidence estimates, and intermediate outputs for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure answer correctness. b) Calibration error: Compare estimated confidence with actual accuracy. c) Brier score: Assess probabilistic forecast quality. d) ECE (Expected Calibration Error): Measure reliability of confidence estimates. e) AUC-ROC: Evaluate discrimination ability of confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare AUT performance against baselines across different domains and question types. b) Analyze how AUT performance varies with question difficulty and domain familiarity. c) Examine the quality and relevance of generated analogous questions. d) Investigate how the number and diversity of analogous questions affect performance. e) Analyze cases where AUT significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each AUT step: a) Remove the similarity analysis step. b) Use only the most similar analogous question. c) Vary the number of analogous questions generated. d) Replace analogous question generation with random questions from the same domain."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the probability that a randomly selected microorganism from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent is a thermophile? Provide your answer and your confidence in the answer (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: The probability that a randomly selected microorganism from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent is a thermophile is approximately 80%. Confidence: 70%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AUT Step 1: Feature Identification)": "Identify the key features and domain of this question: What is the probability that a randomly selected microorganism from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent is a thermophile?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AUT Step 1: Feature Identification)": "Key features: 1) Microorganism selection 2) Deep-sea environment 3) Hydrothermal vent 4) Thermophile classification Domain: Marine microbiology and extremophile ecology",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AUT Step 2: Analogous Question Generation)": "Generate 3 analogous questions from more familiar domains that share structural similarities with this question: What is the probability that a randomly selected microorganism from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent is a thermophile?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AUT Step 2: Analogous Question Generation)": "1. What is the probability that a randomly selected plant from a desert ecosystem is a succulent? 2. What is the likelihood that a randomly chosen bird in the Arctic is adapted for cold temperatures? 3. What is the chance that a randomly picked insect in a rainforest canopy is arboreal?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AUT Step 3: Confidence Estimation for Analogous Questions)": "Provide an answer and confidence estimate (0-100%) for each of these questions: 1. What is the probability that a randomly selected plant from a desert ecosystem is a succulent? 2. What is the likelihood that a randomly chosen bird in the Arctic is adapted for cold temperatures? 3. What is the chance that a randomly picked insect in a rainforest canopy is arboreal?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AUT Step 3: Confidence Estimation for Analogous Questions)": "1. Answer: Approximately 60% of randomly selected plants in a desert ecosystem are succulents. Confidence: 85% 2. Answer: About 95% of randomly chosen birds in the Arctic are adapted for cold temperatures. Confidence: 90% 3. Answer: Roughly 70% of randomly picked insects in a rainforest canopy are arboreal. Confidence: 80%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AUT Step 4: Similarity Analysis)": "Analyze the similarities and differences between the original question and the analogous questions: Original: What is the probability that a randomly selected microorganism from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent is a thermophile? Analogous: 1. What is the probability that a randomly selected plant from a desert ecosystem is a succulent? 2. What is the likelihood that a randomly chosen bird in the Arctic is adapted for cold temperatures? 3. What is the chance that a randomly picked insect in a rainforest canopy is arboreal?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AUT Step 4: Similarity Analysis)": "Similarities: 1) All questions involve probability estimation for a specific adaptation in a given ecosystem. 2) Each question focuses on organisms adapted to extreme or specialized environments. 3) All questions require understanding of how environment shapes biological traits. Differences: 1) The original question deals with microscopic life, while analogous questions involve macroscopic organisms. 2) The deep-sea environment is less familiar than desert, Arctic, or rainforest ecosystems. 3) The temperature adaptation (thermophile) is more specific than the adaptations in the analogous questions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AUT Step 5: Uncertainty Transfer)": "Based on the confidence estimates for the analogous questions and their similarities to the original question, estimate the confidence for the original question: What is the probability that a randomly selected microorganism from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent is a thermophile? Analogous questions with confidence: 1. Desert plant succulent (85% confidence) 2. Arctic bird cold adaptation (90% confidence) 3. Rainforest canopy insect arboreal (80% confidence)",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AUT Step 5: Uncertainty Transfer)": "Estimated confidence for the original question: 82%. This is based on the average confidence of the analogous questions (85% + 90% + 80% / 3 = 85%), slightly adjusted downward due to the less familiar nature of deep-sea environments and the more specific adaptation (thermophile) in question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (AUT Step 6: Final Synthesis)": "Provide a final answer and confidence estimate for the original question, incorporating the analogical analysis: What is the probability that a randomly selected microorganism from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent is a thermophile?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (AUT Step 6: Final Synthesis)": "Answer: The probability that a randomly selected microorganism from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent is a thermophile is approximately 85-90%. This high probability is due to the extreme conditions in hydrothermal vents, which strongly favor thermophilic adaptations. Confidence: 82%. This confidence estimate is derived from analogous situations in other extreme environments, adjusted for the specificity of deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems.",
            "Explanation": "The AUT method provides a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence estimate by leveraging analogical reasoning. It considers similar scenarios in more familiar domains, analyzes the similarities and differences, and then transfers this knowledge to the original, less familiar domain. This process allows the model to ground its uncertainty estimation in more familiar territory, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed AUT method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why AUT fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of analogical reasoning in LLMs. 2) Explore variations of the AUT method, such as using a larger number of analogous questions or incorporating a meta-learning step where the model learns to weigh different analogies based on their relevance. 3) Investigate how the quality of generated analogies correlates with the accuracy of confidence estimates, which could lead to a method for filtering or improving analogy generation. 4) Combine AUT with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration learning, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. 5) Shift focus to analyzing how LLMs perform analogical reasoning in the context of uncertainty estimation, which could provide insights for improving both language models and uncertainty quantification methods in general."
