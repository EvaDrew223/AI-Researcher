        "Problem": "Current prompting methods for uncertainty quantification often rely on static, pre-defined prompts that may not optimally elicit well-calibrated confidence estimates across diverse queries and domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches use fixed prompting strategies or simple few-shot examples for confidence elicitation.",
        "Motivation": "Effective elicitation of well-calibrated confidence estimates often requires adaptive, query-specific prompting strategies that can be refined based on model responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Bayesian Prompt Evolution, a dynamic prompting method that treats uncertainty quantification as a Bayesian experimental design problem. The approach involves: 1) Prior Prompt Distribution: Define a space of possible prompting strategies and initialize a prior distribution over their effectiveness. 2) Iterative Refinement: For each query, sample prompts from the current distribution and use them to elicit confidence estimates. 3) Bayesian Updating: Update the distribution over prompt effectiveness based on the quality and consistency of the elicited estimates. 4) Adaptive Sampling: As the process continues, adaptively sample more effective prompts based on the updated distribution. 5) Final Estimation: Use the most effective discovered prompts to elicit a final, well-calibrated confidence estimate. This method allows for query-specific optimization of uncertainty quantification prompts.",

        "Title": "Bayesian Prompt Evolution: Dynamic Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current prompting methods for uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) often rely on static, pre-defined prompts that may not optimally elicit well-calibrated confidence estimates across diverse queries and domains. This leads to inconsistent and potentially unreliable uncertainty estimates, limiting the practical applicability of LLMs in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically use fixed prompting strategies or simple few-shot examples for confidence elicitation, which may not adapt well to the diverse nature of queries and domains. Effective elicitation of well-calibrated confidence estimates often requires adaptive, query-specific prompting strategies that can be refined based on model responses. By treating uncertainty quantification as a Bayesian experimental design problem, we can dynamically evolve prompts to optimize for well-calibrated confidence estimates across various tasks and domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Bayesian Prompt Evolution, a dynamic prompting method that treats uncertainty quantification as a Bayesian experimental design problem. The approach involves five key steps: 1) Prior Prompt Distribution: Define a space of possible prompting strategies and initialize a prior distribution over their effectiveness. 2) Iterative Refinement: For each query, sample prompts from the current distribution and use them to elicit confidence estimates. 3) Bayesian Updating: Update the distribution over prompt effectiveness based on the quality and consistency of the elicited estimates. 4) Adaptive Sampling: As the process continues, adaptively sample more effective prompts based on the updated distribution. 5) Final Estimation: Use the most effective discovered prompts to elicit a final, well-calibrated confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Prepare a diverse set of tasks and domains for evaluation. Use datasets such as TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, MMLU for multi-task evaluation, and ARC for scientific reasoning. Split each dataset into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Prompt Space Definition": "Define a parametric space of prompts for uncertainty quantification. Include variations in phrasing, examples, and instructions. For instance: 'What is your confidence in this answer on a scale of 0-100%?', 'How certain are you about this response?', 'Provide a probability estimate for the correctness of your answer.'",
            "Step 3: Prior Distribution Initialization": "Initialize a prior distribution over the prompt space. This could be a uniform distribution over all prompts or a more informed prior based on previous research on effective uncertainty quantification prompts.",
            "Step 4: Baseline Implementation": "Implement baseline methods for comparison: (a) Direct prompting without uncertainty quantification, (b) Static uncertainty prompting with a fixed prompt, (c) Few-shot prompting with examples of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 5: Bayesian Prompt Evolution Implementation": "Implement the Bayesian Prompt Evolution method: (a) For each query, sample N prompts from the current distribution. (b) Use these prompts to elicit confidence estimates from the LLM. (c) Evaluate the quality of these estimates using proper scoring rules (e.g., Brier score). (d) Update the distribution over prompt effectiveness using Bayesian inference. (e) Repeat for M iterations, adaptively sampling more effective prompts.",
            "Step 6: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM API from Google.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of Bayesian Prompt Evolution against baselines using: (a) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). (b) Sharpness metrics: Brier score, negative log-likelihood. (c) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy for classification tasks). (d) Prompt effectiveness convergence analysis.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: (a) Vary the number of sampled prompts N and iterations M. (b) Compare different prior distributions. (c) Analyze the effect of different update mechanisms in the Bayesian inference step.",
            "Step 9: Analysis of Evolved Prompts": "Analyze the characteristics of the most effective prompts discovered by the method across different tasks and domains. Identify common patterns or principles that lead to well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 10: Generalization Tests": "Test the generalization of the evolved prompts on unseen tasks and domains to assess their robustness and transferability."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Static Uncertainty Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Static Uncertainty Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Bayesian Prompt Evolution; Initial Iteration)": "Q: What is the capital of France? [Sampled Prompt: Provide your answer followed by a detailed explanation of your reasoning process. Then, based on the strength of your reasoning, estimate your confidence in your answer as a percentage.]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Bayesian Prompt Evolution; Initial Iteration)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Reasoning: France is one of the most well-known countries in the world, and Paris is famously known as its capital. It's the largest city in France, the center of government, and home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower. This fact is widely taught in geography classes and is common knowledge. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Bayesian Prompt Evolution; Final Iteration)": "Q: What is the capital of France? [Evolved Prompt: Provide your answer. Then, consider potential sources of uncertainty or alternative possibilities. Finally, give your confidence as a probability between 0 and 1, where 0 means completely uncertain and 1 means absolutely certain.]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Bayesian Prompt Evolution; Final Iteration)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Potential uncertainties: While this is a widely known fact, there's always a small possibility of recent geopolitical changes or my information being outdated. However, such a major change would be highly unlikely without widespread knowledge. Confidence: 0.997",
            "Explanation": "The Bayesian Prompt Evolution method generates more nuanced and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates by encouraging the model to consider potential sources of uncertainty and express confidence as a precise probability. This approach leads to more reliable and interpretable uncertainty quantification compared to the static prompting baseline."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Bayesian Prompt Evolution method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of how different types of prompts affect uncertainty estimates across various tasks and domains. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of prompt-based uncertainty quantification. Second, we could investigate the relationship between prompt complexity and calibration quality, potentially revealing an optimal trade-off between prompt sophistication and effective uncertainty estimation. Third, we could explore combining our method with other techniques like ensemble methods or temperature scaling to create a hybrid approach for improved calibration. Lastly, if the evolved prompts don't generalize well, we could focus on developing task-specific prompt libraries and analyzing what makes certain prompts effective for particular types of queries or domains. These alternative directions could still yield valuable contributions to the field of uncertainty quantification in large language models."
