        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture the dynamic nature of uncertainty, especially in tasks that involve temporal reasoning or evolving information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide static uncertainty estimates, neglecting the potential for uncertainty to change over time or with the addition of new information.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of temporal coherence in signal processing and the human ability to update beliefs over time, we propose a method that probes the model's uncertainty across different temporal contexts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Probing, a dynamic prompting strategy that assesses model uncertainty across a series of temporally linked contexts. The method involves constructing a sequence of prompts that represent evolving scenarios or incrementally revealed information. At each step, the model is asked to provide both a response and an uncertainty estimate. These estimates are then analyzed for temporal coherence using techniques from time series analysis. We introduce a novel metric, the Temporal Uncertainty Coherence (TUC) score, which measures how consistently the model's uncertainty evolves given new information. Additionally, we develop a visualization tool that maps the 'uncertainty trajectory' over the course of the temporal sequence, allowing for intuitive interpretation of how the model's confidence changes over time.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on tasks involving temporal reasoning, such as story comprehension with incrementally revealed plot points, and evolving news events. We'll compare against static uncertainty estimation baselines, using metrics including our proposed TUC score, as well as traditional measures like calibration error computed at different time points."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Probing: Quantifying Dynamic Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture the dynamic nature of uncertainty, especially in tasks that involve temporal reasoning or evolving information. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret model confidence in scenarios where information changes over time or is incrementally revealed.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide static uncertainty estimates, neglecting the potential for uncertainty to change over time or with the addition of new information. Inspired by the concept of temporal coherence in signal processing and the human ability to update beliefs over time, we propose a method that probes the model's uncertainty across different temporal contexts. This approach aims to provide a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of model uncertainty, which is crucial for applications involving time-sensitive decision-making or evolving narratives.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Probing (TCUP), a dynamic prompting strategy that assesses model uncertainty across a series of temporally linked contexts. The method involves constructing a sequence of prompts that represent evolving scenarios or incrementally revealed information. At each step, the model is asked to provide both a response and an uncertainty estimate. These estimates are then analyzed for temporal coherence using techniques from time series analysis. We introduce a novel metric, the Temporal Uncertainty Coherence (TUC) score, which measures how consistently the model's uncertainty evolves given new information. Additionally, we develop a visualization tool that maps the 'uncertainty trajectory' over the course of the temporal sequence, allowing for intuitive interpretation of how the model's confidence changes over time.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create or adapt datasets that involve temporal reasoning or evolving information. We will use three datasets: (1) TimeQA: a dataset of time-dependent questions, (2) NewsQA: a dataset of news articles with questions asked at different time points, and (3) StoryQA: a dataset of short stories with questions asked as the story progresses.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement static uncertainty estimation methods as baselines. We will use: (1) Temperature scaling, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (3) Ensemble methods.",
            "Step 3: TCUP Implementation": "Implement the TCUP method. For each question in our datasets, create a series of prompts that reveal information incrementally. At each step, prompt the model for both an answer and an uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: TUC Score Calculation": "Implement the TUC score calculation. This involves analyzing the sequence of uncertainty estimates using time series analysis techniques such as autocorrelation and trend analysis.",
            "Step 5: Visualization Tool Development": "Develop a tool to visualize the 'uncertainty trajectory' over the course of the temporal sequence.",
            "Step 6: Model Selection and API Setup": "Set up API access for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Also, prepare local installations of open-source models like BERT and RoBERTa for comparison.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and TCUP. Collect answer predictions, uncertainty estimates, and TUC scores.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of TCUP against baselines using metrics such as answer accuracy, calibration error, and TUC scores. Analyze how uncertainty estimates change over time and how this relates to answer accuracy.",
            "Step 9: Case Studies": "Select representative examples from each dataset to showcase how TCUP captures dynamic uncertainty in different scenarios.",
            "Step 10: Report Writing": "Compile results, visualizations, and analyses into a comprehensive report or paper draft."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was leading the 2020 US presidential election on election night?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "On election night of the 2020 US presidential election, early results showed Donald Trump leading in several key states. However, it's important to note that the final outcome was not determined on election night due to the large number of mail-in ballots that had yet to be counted. Uncertainty: 0.3",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUP; Step 1)": "Q: Who was leading the 2020 US presidential election on election night? Please provide an answer and your uncertainty level (0-1, where 1 is most uncertain).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUP; Step 1)": "Answer: Based on early results on election night, Donald Trump was leading in several key states. However, the race was far from decided due to many uncounted mail-in ballots. Uncertainty: 0.7",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUP; Step 2)": "Q: Who was leading the 2020 US presidential election the day after election night? Please provide an answer and your uncertainty level (0-1, where 1 is most uncertain).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUP; Step 2)": "Answer: The day after election night, the race began to shift. As more mail-in ballots were counted, Joe Biden started to take the lead in key swing states. However, the outcome was still not certain. Uncertainty: 0.5",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUP; Step 3)": "Q: Who won the 2020 US presidential election according to the final vote count? Please provide an answer and your uncertainty level (0-1, where 1 is most uncertain).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUP; Step 3)": "Answer: According to the final vote count, Joe Biden won the 2020 US presidential election. He secured 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 232, and won the popular vote by over 7 million votes. Uncertainty: 0.1",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how TCUP captures the changing uncertainty as more information becomes available over time. The baseline method provides a single, static uncertainty estimate, while TCUP shows how uncertainty decreases as the election results become clearer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCUP does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot our analysis to focus on understanding why dynamic uncertainty estimation is challenging for LLMs. We could investigate patterns in how uncertainty changes across different types of questions or topics, which could provide insights into the model's reasoning process. Additionally, we could explore how different prompting strategies affect the model's uncertainty estimates, potentially leading to the development of improved prompting techniques for uncertainty quantification. Another direction could be to analyze cases where TCUP performs particularly well or poorly, which might reveal specific types of temporal reasoning that are especially challenging for LLMs. This analysis could inform future work on improving LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities."
