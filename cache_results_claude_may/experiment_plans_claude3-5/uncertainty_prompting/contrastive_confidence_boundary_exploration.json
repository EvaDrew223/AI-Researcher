        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in areas of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or calibration of existing outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By actively probing the boundaries between confident and uncertain knowledge, we can map out a more precise confidence landscape for LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Confidence Boundary Exploration (CCBE), a method that systematically generates pairs of closely related queries - one within the model's confident knowledge zone and one just beyond it. The prompting process involves three stages: 1) Seed Generation: Use the LLM to generate a confident statement on a topic. 2) Boundary Probing: Incrementally modify the seed statement to create a spectrum of related queries, ranging from slight variations to significant departures. 3) Contrastive Analysis: Prompt the model to compare its confidence between pairs of queries, using natural language prompts like 'Compare your certainty in statements A and B. Which are you more confident about and why?'. By analyzing the model's comparative confidence assessments, we can map out a high-resolution confidence boundary. This boundary information is then used to calibrate the model's uncertainty estimates on new queries.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CCBE on a range of knowledge-intensive tasks, comparing it to standard confidence estimation techniques. We'll measure performance using metrics such as confidence calibration error, area under the confidence-accuracy curve, and a novel 'boundary precision' metric. Additionally, we'll conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated confidence boundaries to gain insights into the model's knowledge structure."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Boundary Exploration: Mapping Uncertainty Landscapes in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in areas of uncertainty. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing methods for confidence estimation and calibration typically focus on direct confidence estimation or post-hoc calibration of model outputs, which may not capture the nuanced landscape of model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simplistic confidence scores or calibration techniques that may not fully capture the complex landscape of model knowledge. By actively probing the boundaries between confident and uncertain knowledge, we can map out a more precise confidence landscape for LLMs. This approach is inspired by the human cognitive process of exploring the limits of one's knowledge through comparative reasoning. The proposed method, Contrastive Confidence Boundary Exploration (CCBE), aims to leverage the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to identify and characterize its uncertainty boundaries, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Confidence Boundary Exploration (CCBE), a method that systematically generates pairs of closely related queries - one within the model's confident knowledge zone and one just beyond it. The prompting process involves three stages: 1) Seed Generation: Use the LLM to generate a confident statement on a topic. 2) Boundary Probing: Incrementally modify the seed statement to create a spectrum of related queries, ranging from slight variations to significant departures. 3) Contrastive Analysis: Prompt the model to compare its confidence between pairs of queries, using natural language prompts like 'Compare your certainty in statements A and B. Which are you more confident about and why?'. By analyzing the model's comparative confidence assessments, we can map out a high-resolution confidence boundary. This boundary information is then used to calibrate the model's uncertainty estimates on new queries.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of existing datasets and custom-generated queries for our experiments. For knowledge-intensive tasks, we'll use TriviaQA and Natural Questions. For domain-specific knowledge, we'll use subsets of the MMLU dataset. We'll also create a custom dataset of incrementally modified statements derived from these sources to test boundary conditions.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our primary experiments. We'll also include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM from Google (if available) for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Implement CCBE": "Develop a pipeline that implements the three stages of CCBE: a) Seed Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a confident statement on a given topic. Example prompt: 'Generate a factual statement about [topic] that you are very confident is true.' b) Boundary Probing: Create a function that incrementally modifies the seed statement. This could involve word substitutions, adding qualifiers, or changing specifics. c) Contrastive Analysis: Implement a prompting mechanism for comparative confidence assessment. Example prompt: 'Compare your certainty in statements A and B. Which are you more confident about and why? Provide a confidence score for each on a scale of 0-100.'",
            "Step 4: Baseline Implementation": "Implement baseline methods for comparison: a) Direct confidence estimation: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score for each statement. b) Calibrated confidence: Use temperature scaling or Platt scaling on the model's logits to produce calibrated probabilities.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Confidence Calibration Error (CCE): Measure the discrepancy between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. b) Area Under the Confidence-Accuracy Curve (AUCCAC): Plot confidence vs. accuracy and calculate the area under the curve. c) Boundary Precision (BP): A novel metric that measures how accurately the model identifies its knowledge boundaries. This could be calculated by comparing the model's identified boundary to a ground truth boundary established through extensive testing or expert annotation.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Generate seed statements using the LLM. b) Create boundary-probing statement pairs. c) Perform contrastive analysis using CCBE. d) Apply baseline methods for comparison. e) Calculate evaluation metrics for both CCBE and baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the results: a) Compare CCBE performance against baselines across different datasets and models. b) Analyze the confidence landscapes produced by CCBE, identifying patterns or clusters of uncertainty. c) Investigate how the granularity of boundary probing affects the precision of uncertainty estimates. d) Examine cases where CCBE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines, and analyze the characteristics of these cases."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Statement: The capital of France is Paris. How confident are you that this statement is true? Provide a confidence score between 0 and 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Confidence score: 100. I am absolutely certain that the capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCBE; Step 1: Seed Generation)": "Generate a factual statement about European capitals that you are very confident is true.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCBE; Step 1: Seed Generation)": "The city of London is the capital of the United Kingdom.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCBE; Step 2: Boundary Probing)": "Given the seed statement 'The city of London is the capital of the United Kingdom.', generate a related statement that you are less certain about.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCBE; Step 2: Boundary Probing)": "The city of London has been the capital of the United Kingdom since the 18th century.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCBE; Step 3: Contrastive Analysis)": "Compare your certainty in statements A and B. Which are you more confident about and why? Provide a confidence score for each on a scale of 0-100. A: The city of London is the capital of the United Kingdom. B: The city of London has been the capital of the United Kingdom since the 18th century.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCBE; Step 3: Contrastive Analysis)": "I am more confident about statement A. Statement A: Confidence score: 100. This is a well-established fact that London is the current capital of the United Kingdom. Statement B: Confidence score: 85. While London is indeed the capital of the UK, I'm less certain about the specific timeframe mentioned. The United Kingdom, in its current form, was established in 1801, so the statement isn't entirely accurate. London was the capital of the Kingdom of Great Britain before that, but the '18th century' specification introduces some uncertainty.",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how CCBE can probe the model's confidence landscape more effectively than direct estimation. While the model might give high confidence to both statements in isolation, the contrastive approach reveals nuanced differences in certainty levels and the reasoning behind them."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCBE does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated confidence boundaries, focusing on understanding why the method didn't improve calibration. This could involve categorizing types of knowledge boundaries and analyzing model behavior near these boundaries. 2) Investigate how different prompting strategies within the CCBE framework affect the results. We could experiment with various ways of generating boundary-probing statements or different phrasings for the contrastive analysis prompts. 3) Explore how CCBE performs across different types of knowledge or reasoning tasks, which could provide insights into task-specific uncertainty patterns in LLMs. 4) Combine CCBE with other calibration techniques, such as ensemble methods or temperature scaling, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 5) Use the insights gained from CCBE to develop a new metric for assessing LLM uncertainty, which could be valuable even if the calibration itself doesn't improve."
