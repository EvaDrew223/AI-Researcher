    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different types of tasks and knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single-point estimates or basic confidence scoring.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts can express nuanced levels of certainty across different aspects of a problem. Inspired by this, we propose a method to elicit a more granular uncertainty spectrum from LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Calibration (USC), a multi-stage prompting technique. First, we prompt the LLM to decompose a given query into sub-components. For each component, we then ask the model to place its confidence on a spectrum (e.g., 'Highly certain', 'Moderately certain', 'Uncertain', 'Highly uncertain'). We follow this with prompts asking the model to justify each placement. Finally, we aggregate these spectral confidences into an overall uncertainty score. This method allows for more nuanced uncertainty quantification and provides interpretable rationales.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare USC against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and token probability-based approaches on diverse tasks including open-domain QA, scientific reasoning, and commonsense inference. Evaluate using calibration metrics and human expert judgments of uncertainty alignment."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Spectrum Calibration: Enhancing Confidence Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different types of tasks and knowledge domains. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions in areas where the model's knowledge is limited or unreliable, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-point estimates or basic confidence scoring, which fail to capture the nuanced levels of certainty that human experts can express across different aspects of a problem. Inspired by human cognitive abilities, we propose a method to elicit a more granular uncertainty spectrum from LLMs, allowing for more accurate and interpretable confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Calibration (USC), a multi-stage prompting technique designed to improve LLMs' ability to quantify their uncertainty. The USC method consists of four main steps: 1) Query Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the given query into sub-components. 2) Confidence Spectrum Placement: For each sub-component, ask the model to place its confidence on a predefined spectrum (e.g., 'Highly certain', 'Moderately certain', 'Uncertain', 'Highly uncertain'). 3) Justification: Prompt the model to provide rationales for each confidence placement. 4) Aggregation: Combine the spectral confidences into an overall uncertainty score for the original query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering different task types: a) Open-domain QA: Use the Natural Questions dataset. b) Scientific Reasoning: Use the SciQ dataset. c) Commonsense Inference: Use the COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Direct Confidence Elicitation: Prompt the LLM to provide a single confidence score (0-100%) for each query. b) Token Probability-based Approach: Use the average token probability of the generated answer as a confidence measure.",
            "Step 3: USC Implementation": "Implement the USC method with the following sub-steps: a) Query Decomposition: Prompt: 'Break down the following question into its key components: [QUESTION]' b) Confidence Spectrum Placement: Prompt: 'For each component, indicate your confidence level (Highly certain, Moderately certain, Uncertain, Highly uncertain): [COMPONENT]' c) Justification: Prompt: 'Provide a brief explanation for each confidence level assignment.' d) Aggregation: Implement a weighted average method to combine sub-component confidences into an overall score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and USC): a) Generate responses and confidence scores for all queries. b) For USC, store intermediate outputs (decompositions, spectrum placements, justifications) for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "a) Calibration: Compute Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for each method. b) Discrimination: Calculate Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for confidence scores vs. correctness. c) Human Evaluation: Recruit 3-5 domain experts to rate the quality and interpretability of uncertainty assessments on a sample of 100 queries per dataset.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare USC performance against baselines using ECE and AUROC metrics. b) Analyze the correlation between decomposition granularity and calibration improvement. c) Examine justifications to identify patterns in high vs. low confidence assessments. d) Investigate performance differences across task types and knowledge domains."

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (USC; Step 4: Final Answer and Aggregation)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nOverall Confidence Score: 98% (Highly certain)\nExplanation: All components of the question were assessed with high certainty, leading to a very high overall confidence in the answer.",
            "explanation": "The USC method provides a more detailed and interpretable assessment of the model's confidence compared to the baselines. It breaks down the question, evaluates confidence for each component, and provides justifications, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the model's certainty levels."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the USC method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of query decompositions to see if they effectively capture the essential elements of each question. 2) Analyzing the distribution of confidence levels across different components to identify any patterns or biases in the model's self-assessment. 3) Investigating the relationship between justification quality and confidence accuracy to determine if the model's reasoning aligns with its confidence assessments. 4) Exploring alternative aggregation methods for combining component-level confidences into an overall score. Based on these analyses, we may refine the USC method, such as by improving the prompting strategy for decomposition or introducing a more sophisticated aggregation algorithm. Additionally, we could expand the project scope to include an in-depth study of how different types of questions and knowledge domains affect the model's ability to accurately assess its uncertainty, potentially leading to domain-specific calibration strategies."
