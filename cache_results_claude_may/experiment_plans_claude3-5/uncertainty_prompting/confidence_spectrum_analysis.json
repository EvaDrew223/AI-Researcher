        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different types of tasks and knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-point confidence estimates or basic calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express confidence as a range or spectrum rather than a single value, allowing for more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Analysis (CSA), a novel prompting method that elicits a spectrum of confidence levels from the model. The prompt first asks the model to generate multiple possible answers to a given question, ranked from most to least likely. Then, for each answer, the model is prompted to provide a lower and upper bound on its confidence, along with a brief explanation for this range. Finally, the model is asked to synthesize these individual spectra into an overall confidence distribution. This approach allows for capturing nuanced uncertainty across different possible answers and knowledge domains.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CSA against standard single-point confidence estimation and calibration techniques on diverse question-answering datasets spanning factual knowledge, reasoning tasks, and open-ended questions. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and qualitative analysis of confidence explanations."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Analysis: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different types of tasks and knowledge domains. Current approaches typically rely on single-point confidence estimates or basic calibration techniques, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express confidence as a range or spectrum rather than a single value, allowing for more nuanced uncertainty quantification. Existing methods for LLMs lack this flexibility and depth in uncertainty representation. By introducing a method that elicits a spectrum of confidence levels, we aim to better capture the model's uncertainty across different possible answers and knowledge domains, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Analysis (CSA), a novel prompting method that elicits a spectrum of confidence levels from the model. The process involves three main steps: 1) Generate multiple possible answers to a given question, ranked from most to least likely. 2) For each answer, provide a lower and upper bound on confidence, along with a brief explanation for this range. 3) Synthesize these individual spectra into an overall confidence distribution. This approach allows for capturing nuanced uncertainty across different possible answers and knowledge domains.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets spanning factual knowledge, reasoning tasks, and open-ended questions. We will use TriviaQA for factual knowledge, MATH dataset for reasoning tasks, and ARC-Challenge for open-ended science questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard single-point confidence estimation and basic calibration techniques as baselines. For single-point estimation, use the model's output probability. For calibration, implement temperature scaling.",
            "Step 3: CSA Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the CSA method. Example prompts: 1) 'Generate the top 3 most likely answers to this question, ranked from most to least likely:' 2) 'For each answer, provide a confidence range (lower and upper bound) and a brief explanation:' 3) 'Based on these individual confidence spectra, provide an overall confidence distribution for the question:'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run baseline methods. b) Run CSA method. c) Collect model outputs, including answers, confidence estimates, and explanations.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and qualitative analysis of confidence explanations. For calibration error, use Expected Calibration Error (ECE). For Brier score, calculate the mean squared error between the probabilistic predictions and the actual outcomes.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare CSA performance against baselines. Analyze how CSA captures uncertainty differently across various question types and knowledge domains. Examine the quality and informativeness of the confidence explanations provided by the model."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "A: Paris (Confidence: 0.95)"
            },
            "CSA Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "Top 3 answers:\n1. Paris\n2. Lyon\n3. Marseille\n\nConfidence ranges:\n1. Paris: 90-99% - Very high confidence due to widespread knowledge and consistent historical fact.\n2. Lyon: 1-5% - Low confidence, as it's a major city but not the capital.\n3. Marseille: 0.5-2% - Very low confidence, included due to its significance but known not to be the capital.\n\nOverall confidence distribution:\nParis: 95%\nOther major French cities: 4%\nAny other answer: 1%\n\nExplanation: The high confidence in Paris as the answer is due to its well-established status as the capital of France. The small uncertainty accounts for the possibility of misunderstanding the question or extremely unlikely recent changes."
            },
            "Explanation": "The CSA method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence, including alternative answers and explanations for the confidence ranges. This allows for better understanding of the model's uncertainty and reasoning process compared to the single-point estimate in the baseline."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSA doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why LLMs struggle with nuanced uncertainty quantification. We could investigate patterns in confidence spectra across different question types, analyze the quality and consistency of explanations provided, and explore how the model's uncertainty changes with increasing task complexity. Additionally, we could experiment with variations of the CSA prompt, such as asking for different numbers of alternative answers or providing more structured formats for confidence ranges, to see if these modifications improve performance. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about their own uncertainty and suggest directions for future improvements in model architecture or training approaches."
