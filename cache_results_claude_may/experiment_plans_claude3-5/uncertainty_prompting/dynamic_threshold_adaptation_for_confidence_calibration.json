    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often use static confidence thresholds, leading to poor calibration across different tasks and contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically apply fixed adjustments or rely on task-specific fine-tuning, which may not generalize well across diverse queries.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically adjusting confidence thresholds based on the specific context and task characteristics, we can achieve better calibration across a wide range of scenarios without task-specific training.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dynamic Threshold Adaptation for Confidence Calibration (DTACC), a prompting strategy that guides the model to adapt its confidence thresholds on-the-fly. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Analyze the given task, identifying key characteristics (e.g., domain, complexity, available information), 2) Recall performance patterns on similar tasks from its training, 3) Propose task-specific confidence thresholds for different levels (e.g., high, medium, low confidence), 4) Generate the answer and raw confidence score, 5) Calibrate the raw score using the adapted thresholds. This method allows for context-aware calibration without additional training.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate DTACC against static calibration methods across a diverse set of tasks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain queries. Measure performance using adaptive calibration error metrics and assess the method's ability to maintain good calibration across varying task difficulties and domains."

        "Title": "Dynamic Threshold Adaptation for Confidence Calibration (DTACC): Improving LLM Uncertainty Quantification",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often use static confidence thresholds, leading to poor calibration across different tasks and contexts. This results in unreliable uncertainty estimates, which can be problematic in critical applications where accurate confidence assessment is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods typically apply fixed adjustments or rely on task-specific fine-tuning, which may not generalize well across diverse queries. By dynamically adjusting confidence thresholds based on the specific context and task characteristics, we can achieve better calibration across a wide range of scenarios without task-specific training. This approach leverages the LLM's own understanding of task difficulty and domain knowledge to improve calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dynamic Threshold Adaptation for Confidence Calibration (DTACC), a prompting strategy that guides the model to adapt its confidence thresholds on-the-fly. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Analyze the given task, identifying key characteristics (e.g., domain, complexity, available information), 2) Recall performance patterns on similar tasks from its training, 3) Propose task-specific confidence thresholds for different levels (e.g., high, medium, low confidence), 4) Generate the answer and raw confidence score, 5) Calibrate the raw score using the adapted thresholds. This method allows for context-aware calibration without additional training.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks to evaluate DTACC: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-domain knowledge, 3) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 4) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a wide range of domains and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement the following baselines: 1) Vanilla LLM outputs with default confidence scores, 2) Temperature scaling (a post-hoc calibration method), 3) Static threshold adjustment based on overall dataset statistics.",
            "Step 3: DTACC Implementation": "Develop the DTACC prompting strategy with the following components: a) Task analysis prompt, b) Threshold adaptation prompt, c) Answer generation and confidence scoring prompt, d) Calibration application prompt. Each component will be implemented as a separate function that can be chained together.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), 3) Brier Score, 4) Accuracy-Confidence correlation.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results, b) Apply DTACC and collect results, c) Compute evaluation metrics for both baseline and DTACC results.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare DTACC performance against baselines across different tasks and domains, b) Analyze the adapted thresholds to understand how they vary across tasks, c) Investigate cases where DTACC significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing or modifying components of DTACC: a) Remove task analysis step, b) Use fixed thresholds instead of adapted ones, c) Vary the number of confidence levels (e.g., 3 vs. 5 levels)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DTACC Step 1: Task Analysis)": "Analyze the following task: What is the capital of France? Consider the domain, complexity, and available information. Provide a brief analysis.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DTACC Step 1: Task Analysis)": "Task Analysis: This is a straightforward geographical fact question. Domain: Geography. Complexity: Low. Available Information: Common knowledge about major world capitals. This type of question is likely to have high accuracy for well-trained language models.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DTACC Step 2: Threshold Adaptation)": "Based on the task analysis, propose confidence thresholds for high, medium, and low confidence levels that would be appropriate for this type of question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DTACC Step 2: Threshold Adaptation)": "Proposed Confidence Thresholds: High: 90-100%, Medium: 70-89%, Low: 0-69%. These thresholds are set high due to the straightforward nature of the question and the expectation of high accuracy for common geographical facts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DTACC Step 3: Answer Generation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your raw confidence score (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DTACC Step 3: Answer Generation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Raw confidence score: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DTACC Step 4: Calibration)": "Given the raw confidence score of 98% and the adapted thresholds (High: 90-100%, Medium: 70-89%, Low: 0-69%), calibrate the confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DTACC Step 4: Calibration)": "Calibrated Result: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence Level: High (98% falls within the high confidence range of 90-100%)",
            "Explanation": "DTACC improves calibration by adapting thresholds based on task characteristics. For this simple geography question, it sets high thresholds, reflecting the expected high accuracy. The final calibrated output provides a more meaningful confidence assessment compared to the raw score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DTACC does not significantly improve calibration across tasks, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the task analyses generated by the model to see if they accurately capture task difficulty, and investigating whether the adapted thresholds are appropriate. We could also explore alternative prompting strategies for threshold adaptation, such as asking the model to provide justifications for its proposed thresholds. Additionally, we might consider combining DTACC with other calibration methods, such as ensemble techniques or meta-learning approaches, to create a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of multiple approaches. If these attempts do not yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper that provides insights into the challenges of dynamic calibration and the limitations of current LLMs in self-assessing their performance across diverse tasks."
