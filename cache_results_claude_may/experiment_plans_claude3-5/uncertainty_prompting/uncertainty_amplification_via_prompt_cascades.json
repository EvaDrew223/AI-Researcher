    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-step prompting, which may not fully capture the model's uncertainty across different levels of abstraction and reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use direct confidence elicitation or token probability analysis.",
        "Motivation": "By cascading prompts through multiple levels of abstraction and reasoning, we can potentially amplify and better capture the model's underlying uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting cascade that progressively decomposes a given task into sub-tasks of increasing granularity. At each step, the model is prompted to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The cascade continues until a predefined depth is reached or the model expresses high confidence. The final uncertainty estimate is computed by aggregating the confidence scores across all levels, weighted by the abstraction level. This method allows for uncertainty to propagate and potentially amplify through the cascade, revealing subtle uncertainties that might be masked in single-step approaches.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare the proposed method against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and token probability analysis on tasks from the TruthfulQA and MMLU datasets. Evaluate using calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score."

        "Title": "Cascading Uncertainty: Multi-Step Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-step prompting, which may not fully capture the model's uncertainty across different levels of abstraction and reasoning. This limitation can lead to overconfident or poorly calibrated predictions, potentially resulting in unreliable or misleading outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use direct confidence elicitation or token probability analysis, which may not adequately reflect the model's true uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks. By cascading prompts through multiple levels of abstraction and reasoning, we can potentially amplify and better capture the model's underlying uncertainty. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where uncertainty often compounds as we break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting cascade that progressively decomposes a given task into sub-tasks of increasing granularity. At each step, the model is prompted to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The cascade continues until a predefined depth is reached or the model expresses high confidence. The final uncertainty estimate is computed by aggregating the confidence scores across all levels, weighted by the abstraction level. This method allows for uncertainty to propagate and potentially amplify through the cascade, revealing subtle uncertainties that might be masked in single-step approaches.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset for factual question answering and the MMLU dataset for multi-task language understanding. These datasets cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, allowing us to test the method's effectiveness across various domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. (2) Token probability analysis: Use the model's output probabilities to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Cascading Uncertainty Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Task decomposition: For each question, create a cascade of sub-questions that break down the problem into simpler components. b) Confidence elicitation: At each step of the cascade, prompt the model to answer the sub-question and provide a confidence score. c) Aggregation: Combine the confidence scores from all steps, weighting them based on their position in the cascade.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the cascade. Example prompt template: 'Question: {question}\nSub-question: {sub_question}\nPlease answer the sub-question and provide your confidence level (0-100%):\nAnswer: \nConfidence: '",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Apply the baseline methods. b) Apply the cascading uncertainty method with a maximum depth of 3 levels. c) Record the final answer, confidence scores at each level, and the aggregated uncertainty score.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of the baseline methods and the proposed method using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. b) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and reliability diagrams to assess how well the confidence scores align with actual performance. c) Brier Score: Evaluate the quality of probabilistic predictions.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Conduct an in-depth analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of uncertainty estimates between baseline and proposed methods. b) Examination of how uncertainty propagates through the cascade. c) Identification of question types or domains where the method performs particularly well or poorly."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).\nA:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nConfidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Cascading Uncertainty; Level 1)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nSub-question: In which decade did the first moon landing occur?\nPlease answer the sub-question and provide your confidence level (0-100%):\nAnswer:\nConfidence:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Cascading Uncertainty; Level 1)": "Answer: The first moon landing occurred in the 1960s.\nConfidence: 98%",

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Cascading Uncertainty; Level 2)": "Answer: NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) was responsible for the first moon landing.\nConfidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Cascading Uncertainty; Level 3)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nSub-question: What was the name of the first person to walk on the moon?\nPlease answer the sub-question and provide your confidence level (0-100%):\nAnswer:\nConfidence:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Cascading Uncertainty; Level 3)": "Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nConfidence: 97%",
            "Explanation": "The cascading uncertainty method allows for a more nuanced assessment of the model's confidence. By breaking down the question into sub-questions, we can identify potential sources of uncertainty that might not be apparent in a single-step approach. In this example, the model shows high confidence in the contextual information (decade and space agency) but slightly lower confidence in the specific individual, which may more accurately reflect the true uncertainty in the knowledge."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed cascading uncertainty method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to the baselines, we can explore several alternative approaches. First, we could analyze the decomposition process to ensure that the sub-questions are relevant and effectively breaking down the main question. If the decomposition is suboptimal, we could experiment with different strategies for generating sub-questions, possibly using a separate LLM to generate more effective decompositions. Additionally, we could investigate different aggregation methods for combining the confidence scores across levels, such as using non-linear combinations or learned weighting schemes. Another direction would be to incorporate external knowledge or fact-checking steps into the cascade to provide additional calibration points. Finally, if these approaches do not yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper, focusing on understanding why LLMs struggle with uncertainty quantification in multi-step reasoning processes and what this reveals about their internal representations and decision-making processes."
