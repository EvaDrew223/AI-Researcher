        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimates for complex, multi-faceted questions where different aspects of the answer may have varying levels of confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single scalar confidence scores or simple calibration techniques that don't capture the nuanced uncertainty across different semantic components of an answer.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express uncertainty in a more granular way, breaking down complex answers into components with different confidence levels. Inspired by this, we aim to enable LLMs to decompose their uncertainty estimates across semantic dimensions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Lattice (SUL) prompting, a multi-step process where the LLM: 1) Decomposes the question into atomic semantic components. 2) Generates a lattice structure representing relationships between these components. 3) Provides answers and uncertainty estimates for each node in the lattice. 4) Propagates and aggregates uncertainty through the lattice structure. 5) Synthesizes a final answer with a detailed, component-wise uncertainty breakdown. This approach allows for fine-grained uncertainty quantification that respects the semantic structure of the question and answer.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SUL prompting against standard scalar confidence estimation and other uncertainty quantification methods on complex question-answering datasets like HotpotQA and FEVER, measuring both answer accuracy and the quality of uncertainty estimates using metrics like Expected Calibration Error and Brier Score."

        "Title": "Semantic Uncertainty Lattice (SUL) Prompting: Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to provide accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates for complex, multi-faceted questions. Existing methods often rely on single scalar confidence scores or simple calibration techniques that fail to capture the varying levels of uncertainty across different semantic components of an answer.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express uncertainty in a more granular way, breaking down complex answers into components with different confidence levels. Existing approaches for LLM uncertainty quantification lack this nuanced representation. By enabling LLMs to decompose their uncertainty estimates across semantic dimensions, we can achieve more accurate and interpretable uncertainty quantification that respects the structure of complex questions and answers.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Lattice (SUL) prompting, a multi-step process where the LLM: 1) Decomposes the question into atomic semantic components. 2) Generates a lattice structure representing relationships between these components. 3) Provides answers and uncertainty estimates for each node in the lattice. 4) Propagates and aggregates uncertainty through the lattice structure. 5) Synthesizes a final answer with a detailed, component-wise uncertainty breakdown.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the HotpotQA and FEVER datasets, which contain complex multi-hop questions and fact verification tasks. These datasets are suitable for evaluating fine-grained uncertainty quantification as they require reasoning over multiple pieces of information.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard scalar confidence estimation: Prompt the LLM to provide a single confidence score along with its answer. 2) Calibrated prediction: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the LLM's output probabilities.",
            "Step 3: SUL Prompting Implementation": "Implement the SUL prompting method with the following sub-steps: a) Question Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the question into atomic components. b) Lattice Generation: Prompt the LLM to create a lattice structure representing relationships between components. c) Component-wise Answering and Uncertainty Estimation: For each lattice node, prompt the LLM to provide an answer and uncertainty estimate. d) Uncertainty Propagation: Implement a method to aggregate uncertainties through the lattice. e) Final Answer Synthesis: Prompt the LLM to generate a final answer with detailed uncertainty breakdown.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of baseline methods and SUL prompting using the following metrics: 1) Answer Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. 2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Assess the calibration of uncertainty estimates. 3) Brier Score: Evaluate the quality of probabilistic predictions. 4) Semantic Decomposition Quality: Manually assess the quality of question decomposition and lattice structure (for a subset of examples).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of SUL prompting against baselines across different question types and difficulty levels. 2) Analysis of how uncertainty propagates through the semantic lattice. 3) Investigation of cases where SUL prompting significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Scalar Confidence)": "Question: Who was born first, the actor who played Gimli in 'The Lord of the Rings' or the actor who played Magneto in 'X-Men'? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Scalar Confidence)": "Answer: The actor who played Magneto in 'X-Men' (Ian McKellen) was born first. Ian McKellen was born on May 25, 1939, while John Rhys-Davies, who played Gimli in 'The Lord of the Rings', was born on May 5, 1944. Confidence score: 0.9",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUL Prompting; Step 1: Question Decomposition)": "Decompose the following question into atomic semantic components: Who was born first, the actor who played Gimli in 'The Lord of the Rings' or the actor who played Magneto in 'X-Men'?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUL Prompting; Step 1: Question Decomposition)": "1. Identity of the actor who played Gimli in 'The Lord of the Rings'\n2. Birth date of the actor who played Gimli\n3. Identity of the actor who played Magneto in 'X-Men'\n4. Birth date of the actor who played Magneto\n5. Comparison of the two birth dates",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUL Prompting; Step 2: Lattice Generation)": "Generate a lattice structure representing the relationships between the following components: 1. Identity of Gimli actor, 2. Gimli actor's birth date, 3. Identity of Magneto actor, 4. Magneto actor's birth date, 5. Birth date comparison",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUL Prompting; Step 2: Lattice Generation)": "Lattice structure:\n(1) Identity of Gimli actor -> (2) Gimli actor's birth date ->\\\n                                                            (5) Birth date comparison\n(3) Identity of Magneto actor -> (4) Magneto actor's birth date ->/",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUL Prompting; Step 3: Component-wise Answering)": "For each component in the lattice, provide an answer and an uncertainty estimate (0-1 scale, where 0 is completely uncertain and 1 is completely certain):\n1. Identity of Gimli actor\n2. Gimli actor's birth date\n3. Identity of Magneto actor\n4. Magneto actor's birth date\n5. Birth date comparison",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUL Prompting; Step 3: Component-wise Answering)": "1. Identity of Gimli actor: John Rhys-Davies (Certainty: 0.95)\n2. Gimli actor's birth date: May 5, 1944 (Certainty: 0.9)\n3. Identity of Magneto actor: Ian McKellen (Certainty: 0.98)\n4. Magneto actor's birth date: May 25, 1939 (Certainty: 0.9)\n5. Birth date comparison: Ian McKellen (Magneto) was born first (Certainty: 0.85)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUL Prompting; Step 4: Final Answer Synthesis)": "Based on the component-wise answers and uncertainties, synthesize a final answer with a detailed uncertainty breakdown for the question: Who was born first, the actor who played Gimli in 'The Lord of the Rings' or the actor who played Magneto in 'X-Men'?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUL Prompting; Step 4: Final Answer Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The actor who played Magneto in 'X-Men' (Ian McKellen) was born first.\n\nUncertainty Breakdown:\n- Identity of actors: High certainty (Gimli: 0.95, Magneto: 0.98)\n- Birth dates: Good certainty for both (0.9 each)\n- Overall comparison: Moderately high certainty (0.85)\n\nThe final certainty of this answer is 0.85, which is the lowest certainty in the critical path of the reasoning chain. While we are very certain about the identities of the actors and reasonably certain about their birth dates, the slight uncertainty in the dates leads to a small reduction in the overall certainty of the comparison.",
            "explanation": "The SUL prompting method provides a more detailed and nuanced uncertainty quantification compared to the scalar confidence baseline. It breaks down the question into components, assigns individual uncertainties, and synthesizes a final answer with a comprehensive uncertainty breakdown. This approach allows for better understanding of which parts of the answer are more or less certain, and how uncertainties propagate through the reasoning process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SUL prompting method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated semantic lattices to understand if the decomposition is meaningful and if it captures the essential reasoning steps. This could lead to insights on how to improve question decomposition for complex reasoning tasks. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from the SUL approach, which could inform more targeted applications of the method. 3) Analyze the propagation of uncertainties through the lattice to identify potential issues in uncertainty aggregation. This could lead to the development of improved uncertainty propagation algorithms. 4) Compare the SUL method's performance across different LLMs to understand if the effectiveness is model-dependent, which could provide insights into the relationship between model capabilities and fine-grained uncertainty quantification. 5) Explore hybrid approaches that combine SUL prompting with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to potentially achieve better performance."
