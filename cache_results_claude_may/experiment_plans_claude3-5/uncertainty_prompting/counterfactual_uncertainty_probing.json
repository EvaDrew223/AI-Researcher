        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge and provide confident answers even when crucial information is missing or ambiguous.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or post-hoc calibration without explicitly probing the model's understanding of informational dependencies.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring counterfactual scenarios where key information is altered or removed, we can gain insights into the model's reliance on specific facts and its ability to recognize when critical data is missing.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Uncertainty Probing (CUP), a prompting technique that systematically generates and explores counterfactual scenarios to assess model uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Initial Query: 'Answer the following question: [QUESTION]' 2) Key Information Extraction: 'Identify the crucial pieces of information in the question that are necessary to provide a confident answer.' 3) Counterfactual Generation: 'For each key information piece, generate a counterfactual version of the question where this information is altered or removed.' 4) Counterfactual Exploration: 'Answer each of the following counterfactual questions and explain how your confidence changes compared to the original: [COUNTERFACTUALS]' 5) Uncertainty Synthesis: 'Based on your exploration of counterfactuals, reassess your confidence in the answer to the original question. Provide a final answer with a numerical confidence score and explain how the counterfactual analysis influenced your uncertainty assessment.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CUP against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on various QA datasets. Analyze the relationship between counterfactual sensitivity and answer correctness, and assess the quality of uncertainty explanations provided."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Uncertainty Probing: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Systematic Scenario Exploration",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, providing confident answers even when crucial information is missing or ambiguous. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, highlighting the need for better uncertainty quantification methods.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on direct confidence estimation or post-hoc calibration, without explicitly probing the model's understanding of informational dependencies. By exploring counterfactual scenarios where key information is altered or removed, we can gain deeper insights into the model's reliance on specific facts and its ability to recognize when critical data is missing. This approach leverages the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to assess uncertainty, potentially leading to more accurate and interpretable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Uncertainty Probing (CUP), a prompting technique that systematically generates and explores counterfactual scenarios to assess model uncertainty. The process involves five key steps: 1) Initial Query: Prompt the model with the original question. 2) Key Information Extraction: Identify crucial pieces of information necessary for a confident answer. 3) Counterfactual Generation: Create versions of the question where key information is altered or removed. 4) Counterfactual Exploration: Answer each counterfactual and explain confidence changes. 5) Uncertainty Synthesis: Reassess confidence in the original answer based on counterfactual analysis.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse QA datasets that cover a range of domains and complexity levels. We will use: a) TriviaQA for general knowledge, b) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension with unanswerable questions, and c) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods: a) Direct prompting (baseline), b) Temperature scaling, c) Ensemble methods (using different seeds), d) Monte Carlo Dropout (if applicable to the chosen LLM API).",
            "Step 3: CUP Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of the CUP process: a) Initial query prompt, b) Key information extraction prompt, c) Counterfactual generation prompt, d) Counterfactual exploration prompt, e) Uncertainty synthesis prompt.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for primary experiments. Additionally, test on Claude from Anthropic and open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods, b) Execute CUP process, c) Collect model outputs, confidence scores, and explanations.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess performance using: a) Accuracy of final answers, b) Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), c) Qualitative analysis of uncertainty explanations, d) Correlation between counterfactual sensitivity and answer correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis: a) Compare CUP performance against baselines, b) Analyze the quality and relevance of generated counterfactuals, c) Evaluate the impact of different types of information removal on uncertainty estimates, d) Investigate how model size and architecture affect CUP performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.",
            "CUP Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Query)": "Answer the following question: Who was the first person to step on the moon?",
            "CUP Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Query)": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.",
            "CUP Prompt Input (Step 2: Key Information Extraction)": "Identify the crucial pieces of information in the question that are necessary to provide a confident answer to 'Who was the first person to step on the moon?'",
            "CUP Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Key Information Extraction)": "1. The concept of 'first person' (implying a specific individual)\n2. The action of 'stepping on the moon' (implying a moon landing)\n3. The historical context of space exploration",
            "CUP Prompt Input (Step 3: Counterfactual Generation)": "Generate counterfactual versions of the question 'Who was the first person to step on the moon?' where key information is altered or removed:",
            "CUP Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Counterfactual Generation)": "1. Who was the second person to step on the moon?\n2. Who was the first person to orbit the moon?\n3. What was the first object to touch the moon's surface?",
            "CUP Prompt Input (Step 4: Counterfactual Exploration)": "Answer each of the following counterfactual questions and explain how your confidence changes compared to the original: 1. Who was the second person to step on the moon? 2. Who was the first person to orbit the moon? 3. What was the first object to touch the moon's surface?",
            "CUP Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Counterfactual Exploration)": "1. Buzz Aldrin was the second person to step on the moon. Confidence: High (slightly lower than original)\n2. Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders jointly became the first humans to orbit the moon during Apollo 8. Confidence: Medium (lower than original due to multiple individuals)\n3. Luna 2, a Soviet spacecraft, was the first human-made object to reach the moon's surface in 1959. Confidence: Medium-low (lower due to less certainty about unmanned missions)",
            "CUP Prompt Input (Step 5: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on your exploration of counterfactuals, reassess your confidence in the answer to the original question 'Who was the first person to step on the moon?' Provide a final answer with a numerical confidence score (0-100) and explain how the counterfactual analysis influenced your uncertainty assessment.",
            "CUP Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.\nConfidence Score: 95/100\nExplanation: The counterfactual analysis reinforced my confidence in the original answer. The exploration of related scenarios (second person, orbiting, first object) highlighted the uniqueness and historical significance of Armstrong's achievement. The high confidence in identifying Buzz Aldrin as the second person supports the accuracy of the chronology. The lower confidence in the unmanned mission question suggests some uncertainty about very early lunar exploration, but this doesn't significantly impact the confidence in human moon landings. The slight reduction from 100 to 95 accounts for the small possibility of overlooking very early, less-documented attempts or alternative interpretations of 'stepping on the moon'.",
            "Explanation": "CUP prompting allows the model to systematically explore related scenarios, helping it to better calibrate its confidence. The process of generating and answering counterfactuals forces the model to consider the boundaries of its knowledge and the specificity of the original question, leading to a more nuanced and justified confidence assessment."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CUP method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could involve categorizing types of counterfactuals and their impact on confidence. 2) Investigate how different LLMs respond to CUP, potentially uncovering insights about model architectures and pre-training strategies. 3) Explore hybrid approaches that combine CUP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using CUP-generated explanations to inform ensemble weighting or temperature scaling. 4) Analyze cases where CUP leads to decreased performance, which could provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning processes and limitations. 5) Develop a new metric for evaluating the quality of uncertainty explanations, which could be a valuable contribution even if CUP itself doesn't outperform baselines."
