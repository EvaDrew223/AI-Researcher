        "Problem": "LLMs often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when asked similar questions over time, indicating a lack of temporal coherence in uncertainty quantification.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current methods assess uncertainty based on single-time-point prompts, neglecting the temporal dimension of model confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence typically exhibits temporal stability for consistent information. By probing an LLM's confidence over simulated time intervals, we can uncover inconsistencies and improve uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Probing (TCP), a prompting strategy that simulates the passage of time to assess the stability of an LLM's confidence. The method involves: 1) Initial Query: Pose a question and record the model's answer and confidence. 2) Time Simulation: Generate a series of prompts that simulate the passage of time, e.g., 'One day later, you are asked the same question. What is your answer and confidence now?'. 3) Coherence Analysis: Compare the model's responses and confidence levels across the simulated time points. 4) Dynamic Calibration: Use the temporal variance in confidence to adjust the model's uncertainty estimates. The prompts are designed to mimic natural conversations over time, allowing for the emergence of temporal patterns in confidence. We also introduce a 'temporal confidence stability score' to quantify the coherence of uncertainty estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TCP on a diverse set of questions, including factual, opinion-based, and ambiguous queries. Performance will be measured using standard calibration metrics, as well as new temporal stability metrics. We'll compare TCP against static confidence estimation methods and analyze how different types of questions affect temporal coherence in uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Probing: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when asked similar questions over time, indicating a lack of temporal coherence in uncertainty quantification. This inconsistency undermines the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications where consistent confidence estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for assessing uncertainty in LLMs typically rely on single-time-point prompts, neglecting the temporal dimension of model confidence. Human confidence, in contrast, generally exhibits temporal stability for consistent information. By probing an LLM's confidence over simulated time intervals, we can uncover inconsistencies and improve uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the LLM's own capabilities to enhance its performance without requiring extensive retraining or external data sources.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Coherence Probing (TCP), a prompting strategy that simulates the passage of time to assess the stability of an LLM's confidence. The method involves four main steps: 1) Initial Query: Pose a question and record the model's answer and confidence. 2) Time Simulation: Generate a series of prompts that simulate the passage of time, e.g., 'One day later, you are asked the same question. What is your answer and confidence now?'. 3) Coherence Analysis: Compare the model's responses and confidence levels across the simulated time points. 4) Dynamic Calibration: Use the temporal variance in confidence to adjust the model's uncertainty estimates. We also introduce a 'temporal confidence stability score' to quantify the coherence of uncertainty estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Compile a diverse set of questions from existing datasets, including TruthfulQA for factual queries, OpinionQA for subjective questions, and AmbigQA for ambiguous queries. Ensure a balanced distribution of question types.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: a) Direct confidence estimation: Ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: TCP Implementation": "Develop the TCP method: a) Create initial query prompts. b) Design time simulation prompts (e.g., 'One day later...', 'One week later...', 'One month later...'). c) Implement coherence analysis by comparing answers and confidences across time points. d) Develop a dynamic calibration algorithm that adjusts confidence based on temporal variance.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply baseline methods to get initial confidence estimates. b) Apply TCP method with 5 time points (initial, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year). c) Record all responses, confidence scores, and temporal variations.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "a) Compute standard calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, Brier Score) for baselines and TCP. b) Calculate the new 'temporal confidence stability score' for TCP results. c) Analyze how different question types affect temporal coherence in uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Compare TCP performance against baselines across different question types. b) Investigate patterns in temporal confidence changes. c) Identify cases where TCP significantly improves or fails to improve uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 7: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI API for primary experiments. Additionally, test on open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 8: Prompt Engineering": "Design effective prompts for each step of TCP. Example initial prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence level from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'. Example time simulation prompt: 'Imagine one week has passed. You are asked the same question again: [QUESTION]. What is your answer and confidence level now?'",
            "Step 9: Implementation of Temporal Confidence Stability Score": "Develop an algorithm to calculate this score based on the variance of confidence estimates across time points, normalized by the initial confidence.",
            "Step 10: Error Analysis": "Conduct a detailed error analysis on cases where TCP performs poorly, categorizing error types and potential causes."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP; Initial Query)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP; Initial Query)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP; Time Simulation)": "Imagine one week has passed. You are asked the same question again: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? What is your answer and confidence level now?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP; Time Simulation)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP; Final Calibration)": "Based on your consistent answers and confidence levels over simulated time intervals, provide a final calibrated answer and confidence level for the question: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP; Final Calibration)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Calibrated Confidence: 98",
            "explanation": "In this example, TCP demonstrates temporal coherence in both the answer and confidence level, leading to a slight increase in the final calibrated confidence. This contrasts with potential inconsistencies in baseline methods where confidence might fluctuate without justification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCP does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we will pivot to an in-depth analysis of temporal patterns in LLM confidence. We'll investigate: 1) How confidence changes over different time scales for various question types. 2) Whether certain topics or question structures lead to more consistent confidence estimates. 3) The relationship between answer correctness and confidence stability. This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and inform future approaches to improving uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we'll explore combining TCP with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration via fine-tuning, to see if hybrid approaches yield better results."
