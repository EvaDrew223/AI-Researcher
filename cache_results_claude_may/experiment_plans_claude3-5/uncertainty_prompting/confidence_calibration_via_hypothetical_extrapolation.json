    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with queries that require extrapolation beyond their training data or into hypothetical scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on assessing confidence based on the model's current knowledge, without explicitly probing its ability to reason about hypothetical or edge cases.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to consider hypothetical extensions or variations of the given query, we can gain insight into the robustness of its knowledge and use this to calibrate its confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hypothetical Extrapolation for Confidence Calibration (HECC): 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate for the given query. 2) Prompt the model to generate a series of hypothetical variations or extensions of the query, pushing the boundaries of the original context. 3) For each hypothetical scenario, elicit a confidence estimate and reasoning. 4) Analyze the pattern of confidence across hypotheticals to assess the robustness of the model's knowledge. 5) Use this analysis to calibrate the confidence in the original response. The method includes a novel technique for generating diverse and relevant hypothetical scenarios.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare HECC against standard confidence estimation methods on tasks requiring extrapolation or reasoning about edge cases. Evaluate using calibration metrics and the ability to identify queries where the model's knowledge becomes unreliable under extrapolation."

        "Title": "Hypothetical Extrapolation for Confidence Calibration (HECC): Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with queries that require extrapolation beyond their training data or into hypothetical scenarios. This overconfidence in unfamiliar territories can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation. Existing methods typically focus on assessing confidence based on the model's current knowledge, without explicitly probing its ability to reason about hypothetical or edge cases.",
        "Motivation": "Current confidence estimation techniques for LLMs are limited in their ability to handle queries that push the boundaries of the model's knowledge. By prompting the model to consider hypothetical extensions or variations of the given query, we can gain insight into the robustness of its knowledge and use this to calibrate its confidence. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to explore the limits of its knowledge, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hypothetical Extrapolation for Confidence Calibration (HECC), a novel prompting method that consists of the following steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate for the given query. 2) Prompt the model to generate a series of hypothetical variations or extensions of the query, pushing the boundaries of the original context. 3) For each hypothetical scenario, elicit a confidence estimate and reasoning. 4) Analyze the pattern of confidence across hypotheticals to assess the robustness of the model's knowledge. 5) Use this analysis to calibrate the confidence in the original response. The method includes a novel technique for generating diverse and relevant hypothetical scenarios.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a combination of existing datasets and create a new dataset specifically for this task. For existing datasets, we will use TruthfulQA and AmbigQA, which contain questions that often require extrapolation or reasoning about edge cases. We will also create a new dataset called HypotheticalQA, consisting of 1000 questions across various domains (science, history, current events) that are designed to test the limits of model knowledge and require extrapolation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard confidence estimation: Use the model's output probability as a proxy for confidence. 2) Calibrated confidence estimation: Use temperature scaling to calibrate the model's confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: HECC Implementation": "Implement the HECC method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response generation: Prompt the model to generate an answer and confidence score for the original question. b) Hypothetical scenario generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 hypothetical variations of the original question that push the boundaries of the context. c) Confidence estimation for hypotheticals: For each hypothetical scenario, prompt the model to provide an answer and confidence score. d) Confidence calibration: Analyze the pattern of confidence across hypotheticals and use this to adjust the confidence in the original response.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the performance of HECC against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) AUC-ROC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores. 4) Extrapolation performance: Measure the accuracy on a subset of questions that specifically require extrapolation.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of HECC performance against baselines across different question types and domains. 2) Analysis of the generated hypothetical scenarios to understand their diversity and relevance. 3) Investigation of how the confidence patterns in hypothetical scenarios correlate with actual performance on extrapolation tasks."

            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Calibrated Response)": "Based on the original question and the hypothetical scenarios explored, provide a final answer with a calibrated confidence score. Explain how the hypotheticals influenced your confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Calibrated Response)": "Final Answer: Discovering a planet with Earth-like conditions but twice the size of Jupiter in our solar system would have several significant implications:\n\n1. Gravitational disruption: Such a massive planet would severely disrupt the orbits of other planets in our solar system, potentially causing collisions or ejections of smaller planets.\n\n2.

Public interest surge: The discovery would likely generate immense public interest and potentially increase funding for space exploration and related sciences.\n\nCalibrated Confidence: 65%\n\nExplanation: The exploration of hypothetical scenarios revealed several areas of uncertainty and potential complexities that weren't initially considered. The dark matter and artificial planet scenarios highlighted how our understanding could be fundamentally challenged in ways we hadn't anticipated. The collision course scenario emphasized the potential for immediate, practical consequences that might overshadow theoretical implications. The non-carbon-based life scenario underscored the potential for biological discoveries that could reshape our understanding of life itself. These considerations have led me to reduce my confidence from the initial 80% to a more conservative 65%, reflecting a more nuanced understanding of the potential implications and the limits of our current knowledge in extreme scenarios.",
            "explanation": "The HECC method allows for a more nuanced and calibrated confidence assessment by exploring hypothetical scenarios that push the boundaries of the original question. This process reveals potential areas of uncertainty and complexity that may not be apparent in the initial response, leading to a more accurate representation of the model's confidence in its answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the HECC method does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot our research in several directions. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why the hypothetical scenarios did not lead to better calibration. This might involve categorizing the types of hypotheticals generated and their relationship to the original question, as well as analyzing the model's reasoning patterns across different scenarios. Second, we could explore alternative ways of incorporating the hypothetical scenarios into the confidence calibration process, such as using a weighted average based on the relevance of each scenario or employing a machine learning model to predict the final confidence based on the pattern of confidences across scenarios. Third, we could investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, potentially leading to a more targeted application of HECC. Finally, we could expand our study to include human evaluations of the model's responses and confidence estimates, providing insights into how HECC affects the perceived reliability and usefulness of the model's outputs from a user perspective. These alternative approaches could transform the project into a comprehensive analysis of how exploring hypothetical scenarios influences LLM reasoning and confidence estimation, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
