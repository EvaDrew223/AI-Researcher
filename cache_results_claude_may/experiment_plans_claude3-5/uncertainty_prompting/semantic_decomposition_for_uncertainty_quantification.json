    "idea_name": "Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Quantification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods often treat model outputs as atomic units, failing to capture the nuanced uncertainties that may exist within different semantic components of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide a single confidence score for an entire output, which can be overly simplistic for complex, multi-faceted responses.",
        "Motivation": "Many model outputs, especially for complex tasks, contain multiple semantic components, each of which may have different levels of uncertainty. By decomposing outputs and assessing uncertainty at a finer granularity, we can provide more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Quantification (SDUQ), a prompting technique that guides the model to break down its responses into semantic components and assess uncertainty for each component separately. The process involves three main steps: 1) Semantic parsing, where the model identifies key semantic elements in its response, 2) Component-wise uncertainty estimation, where the model assigns confidence scores to each semantic element, and 3) Holistic uncertainty synthesis, where the model combines component-level uncertainties into an overall uncertainty estimate, considering potential dependencies between components. This approach allows for more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SDUQ on tasks that naturally involve multiple semantic components, such as open-ended question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning problems. We'll compare against baseline methods that provide single confidence scores, using metrics like ECE and Brier score. Additionally, we'll introduce new metrics to assess the quality and usefulness of component-wise uncertainty estimates. Human evaluation will be conducted to assess the interpretability and actionability of the decomposed uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Quantification (SDUQ): Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often provide a single confidence score for entire outputs, failing to capture the nuanced uncertainties that may exist within different semantic components of a response. This oversimplification can lead to inaccurate or misleading uncertainty estimates, especially for complex, multi-faceted responses.",
        "Motivation": "Many model outputs, particularly for complex tasks, contain multiple semantic components, each of which may have different levels of uncertainty. Existing approaches that treat model outputs as atomic units fail to capture these nuances. By decomposing outputs and assessing uncertainty at a finer granularity, we can provide more informative and actionable uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often have varying levels of confidence in different aspects of our knowledge or reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Decomposition for Uncertainty Quantification (SDUQ), a prompting technique that guides the model to break down its responses into semantic components and assess uncertainty for each component separately. The process involves three main steps:\n1. Semantic parsing: The model identifies key semantic elements in its response.\n2. Component-wise uncertainty estimation: The model assigns confidence scores to each semantic element.\n3. Holistic uncertainty synthesis: The model combines component-level uncertainties into an overall uncertainty estimate, considering potential dependencies between components.\nThis approach allows for more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that naturally involve multiple semantic components:\n1. Open-ended question answering: TruthfulQA dataset\n2. Summarization: CNN/DailyMail dataset\n3. Complex reasoning: StrategyQA dataset",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\n1. Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score for its entire output.\n2. Monte Carlo Dropout: Use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SDUQ Implementation": "Implement the SDUQ method with the following steps:\n1. Semantic parsing prompt: \"Identify and list the key semantic components in your response.\"\n2. Component-wise uncertainty estimation prompt: \"For each semantic component, provide a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely uncertain and 1 is completely certain.\"\n3. Holistic uncertainty synthesis prompt: \"Considering the individual component uncertainties and their potential dependencies, provide an overall confidence score for the entire response.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics:\n1. Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n2. Brier Score\n3. Semantic Component Uncertainty Correlation (SCUC): A new metric we introduce to measure the correlation between component-level uncertainties and their correctness.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the interpretability and actionability of the decomposed uncertainty estimates. Recruit 5 expert annotators to rate the usefulness of SDUQ outputs compared to baseline methods on a 5-point Likert scale.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare SDUQ performance against baselines using the defined metrics.\n2. Analyze the correlation between component-level uncertainties and overall uncertainty.\n3. Investigate how SDUQ performs across different types of questions or tasks within each dataset.\n4. Examine cases where SDUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France, and when was the Eiffel Tower built? Provide your answer and a single confidence score for the entire response.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889. Confidence score: 0.9",
            "SDUQ Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France, and when was the Eiffel Tower built? Please provide your answer, then identify the key semantic components, assign confidence scores to each component, and finally provide an overall confidence score.",
            "SDUQ Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889.\n\nSemantic components:\n1. Capital of France\n2. Year Eiffel Tower was built\n\nComponent confidence scores:\n1. Capital of France: 0.99\n2. Year Eiffel Tower was built: 0.95\n\nOverall confidence score: 0.97\n\nExplanation: I'm very confident about the capital of France being Paris. I'm slightly less certain about the exact year the Eiffel Tower was built, but still quite confident. The overall confidence is high but slightly lower than the capital component due to the small uncertainty in the Eiffel Tower construction date.",
            "Explanation": "SDUQ provides a more nuanced uncertainty quantification by breaking down the response into semantic components and assigning individual confidence scores. This allows for a more detailed understanding of where potential uncertainties lie within the response, which is not possible with the baseline method that only provides a single overall confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SDUQ does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate whether the semantic decomposition itself is valuable by comparing human judgments of uncertainty based on SDUQ outputs versus baseline outputs. Additionally, we could explore whether certain types of questions or tasks benefit more from semantic decomposition than others. This could lead to insights about when and how to apply more fine-grained uncertainty quantification techniques. We could also analyze the relationship between component-level uncertainties and overall uncertainties to understand if there are patterns in how models aggregate uncertainties across components. This could inform the development of improved uncertainty synthesis methods. Finally, we could examine cases where SDUQ performs poorly to identify potential limitations of the approach and suggest future research directions for improving uncertainty quantification in language models."
