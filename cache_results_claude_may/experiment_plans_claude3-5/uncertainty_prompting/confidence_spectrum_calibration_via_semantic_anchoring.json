    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates across diverse domains and tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By anchoring confidence estimates to familiar semantic concepts, we can leverage the model's understanding of relative certainty in everyday scenarios to improve calibration across domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting approach: 1) Semantic Anchoring: We first prompt the model to generate a spectrum of everyday scenarios with varying levels of certainty (e.g., 'the sun will rise tomorrow' to 'it will rain exactly 3 inches next Tuesday'). 2) Confidence Mapping: For each query, we then prompt the model to place its confidence relative to these semantic anchors. The prompt includes instructions like 'Compare your confidence in the following answer to the certainty levels in the provided scenarios. Place your confidence on this spectrum and explain your reasoning.' This method encourages more granular and contextually-grounded confidence estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate this method against standard confidence elicitation techniques on diverse question-answering datasets, measuring calibration error, Brier score, and correlation between confidence and accuracy. We'll also assess the method's generalization to out-of-distribution queries."

        "Title": "Semantic Anchoring for Improved Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates across diverse domains and tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones. This issue hinders the reliability and interpretability of model outputs, potentially limiting their practical applications in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence calibration typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration techniques, which may not fully leverage the model's inherent understanding of uncertainty. By anchoring confidence estimates to familiar semantic concepts, we can potentially tap into the model's understanding of relative certainty in everyday scenarios to improve calibration across domains. This method could provide a more intuitive and context-aware approach to confidence estimation, potentially leading to better-calibrated outputs without the need for extensive additional training or external calibration models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting approach called Semantic Anchoring for Confidence Calibration (SACC):\n1. Semantic Anchoring: We first prompt the model to generate a spectrum of everyday scenarios with varying levels of certainty (e.g., 'the sun will rise tomorrow' to 'it will rain exactly 3 inches next Tuesday').\n2. Confidence Mapping: For each query, we then prompt the model to place its confidence relative to these semantic anchors. The prompt includes instructions like 'Compare your confidence in the following answer to the certainty levels in the provided scenarios. Place your confidence on this spectrum and explain your reasoning.'\nThis method encourages more granular and contextually-grounded confidence estimates by leveraging the model's understanding of relative certainty in familiar contexts.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of domains and difficulty levels. We will use:\n- TriviaQA for general knowledge\n- SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension\n- ARC-Challenge for science questions\n- MMLU for multi-task language understanding",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\n1. Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each question.\n2. Temperature scaling: Use the softmax temperature as a proxy for confidence.\n3. Monte Carlo Dropout: Perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SACC Implementation": "Implement the proposed SACC method:\n1. Generate a set of 10 semantic anchors ranging from very certain to very uncertain events.\n2. For each question, append the semantic anchors and the confidence mapping prompt.\n3. Extract the model's confidence estimate from its response.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method:\n1. Generate answers and confidence estimates for all questions.\n2. Calculate the following metrics:\n   - Calibration error (difference between confidence and accuracy)\n   - Brier score\n   - Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n   - Correlation between confidence and accuracy\n3. Generate reliability diagrams to visualize calibration.",
            "Step 6: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Evaluation": "Test the generalization of SACC on out-of-distribution queries:\n1. Generate a set of intentionally ambiguous or nonsensical questions.\n2. Apply SACC and baseline methods to these questions.\n3. Evaluate the methods' ability to express low confidence for these OOD queries.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare SACC performance against baselines across all metrics and datasets.\n2. Analyze the impact of different semantic anchor sets on calibration performance.\n3. Examine cases where SACC significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines.\n4. Investigate the relationship between answer correctness, confidence estimates, and the chosen semantic anchors."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "I am 100% confident in my answer that the capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SACC)": "Consider the following spectrum of certainty:\n1. The sun will rise tomorrow (extremely certain)\n2. A coin flip will result in heads (moderately uncertain)\n3. It will rain exactly 3 inches next Tuesday (highly uncertain)\n\nQ: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nCompare your confidence in the above answer to the certainty levels in the provided scenarios. Place your confidence on this spectrum and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SACC)": "My confidence in the answer that Paris is the capital of France is closest to the certainty level of 'The sun will rise tomorrow'. I would place it at the extremely certain end of the spectrum.\n\nReasoning: The fact that Paris is the capital of France is a well-established, widely known, and stable piece of information. It has been true for centuries and is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. This level of certainty is comparable to natural phenomena like the sun rising, which we can predict with extremely high confidence based on our understanding of planetary motion.\n\nWhile there's always a tiny possibility of extremely unlikely events (like a major governmental change that moves the capital), the probability is so low that for all practical purposes, we can consider this fact to be as certain as the sun rising tomorrow.",
            "Explanation": "The SACC method provides a more nuanced and contextually grounded confidence estimate compared to the direct elicitation method. By anchoring the confidence to familiar scenarios, it encourages the model to reason about its certainty in a more calibrated way, potentially leading to more accurate and interpretable confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SACC method does not significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the generated semantic anchors to understand if they provide a sufficient range of certainty levels. We might need to experiment with different sets of anchors or allow the model to generate task-specific anchors.\n2. Investigate whether the model's reasoning about confidence aligns with human intuition by conducting a small-scale human evaluation of the model's confidence explanations.\n3. Explore a hybrid approach that combines SACC with post-hoc calibration methods, using the semantic anchoring as a pre-processing step before applying techniques like temperature scaling.\n4. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify patterns in cases where SACC fails to improve calibration. This could lead to insights about the limitations of using semantic anchors and potential areas for improvement.\n5. Shift focus to analyze how different prompting strategies affect the model's expression of uncertainty, turning the project into a comparative study of various uncertainty elicitation techniques in large language models."
