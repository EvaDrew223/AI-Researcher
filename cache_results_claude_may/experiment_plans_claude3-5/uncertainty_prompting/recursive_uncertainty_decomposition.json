    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overly simplistic uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the hierarchical nature of knowledge and reasoning uncertainties.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current methods treat uncertainty as a single-dimensional measure, failing to decompose it into its constituent sources or levels.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts can break down their uncertainty into multiple levels, distinguishing between uncertainties in foundational knowledge, intermediate reasoning steps, and final conclusions. By mimicking this process, we may achieve more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition (RUD), a hierarchical prompting approach: 1) For a given query, prompt the model to identify key knowledge components and reasoning steps required for the answer. 2) For each component, recursively apply uncertainty estimation, breaking it down into sub-components if necessary. 3) Propagate uncertainties upwards, combining lower-level uncertainties to inform higher-level estimates. 4) Generate a final response with a structured uncertainty breakdown, showing how different sources contribute to the overall uncertainty. This method produces a tree-like decomposition of uncertainty, allowing for more nuanced and interpretable confidence estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RUD with flat uncertainty estimation techniques on complex reasoning tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step inference or integration of multiple knowledge domains. Evaluate the method's ability to identify specific sources of uncertainty, its correlation with expert-annotated uncertainty breakdowns, and its impact on overall calibration metrics."

        "Title": "Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition: Hierarchical Prompting for Granular Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overly simplistic uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the hierarchical nature of knowledge and reasoning uncertainties. This limitation hinders the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs, especially in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods typically treat uncertainty as a single-dimensional measure, failing to decompose it into its constituent sources or levels. Human experts, in contrast, can break down their uncertainty into multiple levels, distinguishing between uncertainties in foundational knowledge, intermediate reasoning steps, and final conclusions. By mimicking this process, we aim to achieve more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification in LLMs. This approach could significantly enhance the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding the source and nature of uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition (RUD), a hierarchical prompting approach that breaks down uncertainty estimation into multiple levels. The method consists of four main steps: 1) For a given query, prompt the model to identify key knowledge components and reasoning steps required for the answer. 2) For each component, recursively apply uncertainty estimation, breaking it down into sub-components if necessary. 3) Propagate uncertainties upwards, combining lower-level uncertainties to inform higher-level estimates. 4) Generate a final response with a structured uncertainty breakdown, showing how different sources contribute to the overall uncertainty. This method produces a tree-like decomposition of uncertainty, allowing for more nuanced and interpretable confidence estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require complex reasoning: 1) MultiArith for multi-step arithmetic reasoning, 2) QASC for multi-hop science question answering, and 3) StrategyQA for strategic reasoning. These datasets cover a range of reasoning types and complexities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with a simple confidence score request, and 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with a confidence score for each step and the final answer.",
            "Step 3: RUD Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition method: a) Develop prompts for each step of RUD. b) Implement the recursive function to break down components and estimate uncertainties. c) Develop a method to propagate and combine uncertainties.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model, with GPT-3.5-turbo as a secondary model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Accuracy of final answers. b) Calibration error (comparing estimated uncertainties with actual error rates). c) Decomposition quality (human evaluation of the relevance and granularity of uncertainty breakdowns). d) Correlation between uncertainty estimates and answer correctness.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run the RUD method. c) Collect results including final answers, uncertainty estimates, and intermediate decompositions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of RUD against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze the structure of uncertainty decompositions produced by RUD. c) Investigate how different types of reasoning tasks affect the uncertainty decomposition. d) Examine cases where RUD significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

            "explanation": "The RUD method provides a more detailed and nuanced breakdown of uncertainty compared to the baselines. It identifies specific sources of uncertainty within the problem-solving process, allowing for better interpretation of the model's confidence. This granular approach can help pinpoint areas where the model might need improvement or where additional information might be beneficial."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RUD method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the uncertainty decompositions to understand why they might not be improving performance. This could involve examining the correlation between different levels of uncertainty and answer correctness, potentially revealing insights about the model's reasoning process. 2) Investigate whether certain types of problems or reasoning steps consistently lead to higher or lower uncertainties, which could inform targeted improvements to LLM training or prompting strategies. 3) Explore alternative methods of combining and propagating uncertainties in the hierarchy, such as weighted averages or more complex probabilistic models. 4) Analyze cases where RUD performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines, which might reveal specific strengths or weaknesses of the approach. 5) Consider expanding the project to include human evaluation of the interpretability and usefulness of the uncertainty decompositions, even if they don't directly improve quantitative performance metrics. This could shift the focus towards improving explainability and user trust in LLM outputs."
