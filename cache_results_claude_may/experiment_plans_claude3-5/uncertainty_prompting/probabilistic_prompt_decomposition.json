        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different aspects of a complex query, leading to overconfidence in some areas and underconfidence in others.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on global uncertainty estimates or simple confidence scores, which fail to capture fine-grained uncertainties.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we can decompose complex queries into smaller sub-components and estimate uncertainty for each part separately.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Prompt Decomposition (PPD), which automatically breaks down a given prompt into a tree of sub-queries. For each sub-query, we generate multiple completions and estimate local uncertainty. These local uncertainties are then propagated and combined using belief propagation algorithms to produce a final calibrated confidence score. The decomposition is done recursively, with the model itself generating the sub-queries and determining when to stop decomposing further.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PPD against standard prompting baselines on complex reasoning tasks from benchmarks like MMLU and BigBench. We'll measure calibration using metrics like ECE and compare the granularity of uncertainty estimates using human evaluation."

        "Title": "Probabilistic Prompt Decomposition: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Query Decomposition",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different aspects of a complex query, leading to overconfidence in some areas and underconfidence in others. This inconsistency in uncertainty estimation can result in unreliable outputs and hinder the model's ability to make informed decisions or provide accurate confidence levels for its responses.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically rely on global uncertainty estimates or simple confidence scores, which fail to capture fine-grained uncertainties. Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we can decompose complex queries into smaller sub-components and estimate uncertainty for each part separately. This approach allows for a more nuanced and accurate representation of the model's confidence across different aspects of a query, potentially leading to better-calibrated outputs and more reliable decision-making.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Prompt Decomposition (PPD), which automatically breaks down a given prompt into a tree of sub-queries. For each sub-query, we generate multiple completions and estimate local uncertainty. These local uncertainties are then propagated and combined using belief propagation algorithms to produce a final calibrated confidence score. The decomposition is done recursively, with the model itself generating the sub-queries and determining when to stop decomposing further. This approach allows for a more granular and accurate representation of uncertainty across different aspects of a complex query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from benchmarks like MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) and BigBench. Focus on subsets that involve multi-step reasoning or require diverse knowledge, such as science questions, logical reasoning tasks, and multi-hop inference problems.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting baselines: (a) Direct prompting: simply ask the question. (b) Few-shot prompting: include 2-3 examples before the target question. (c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: append 'Let's approach this step-by-step:' to the question.",
            "Step 3: PPD Implementation": "Implement the Probabilistic Prompt Decomposition method: (a) Prompt the model to decompose the query into sub-queries. Use few-shot examples to guide this process. (b) For each sub-query, generate multiple completions (e.g., 5-10) using temperature sampling. (c) Estimate local uncertainty for each sub-query based on the variance of these completions. (d) Implement a belief propagation algorithm to combine local uncertainties into a global confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. These models provide strong performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (a) Accuracy: Compare the final answers from PPD and baselines. (b) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. (c) Uncertainty Granularity: Conduct a human evaluation to compare the specificity and relevance of uncertainty estimates between PPD and baselines.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis: (a) Decomposition quality: Manually review a subset of decompositions to assess their relevance and completeness. (b) Uncertainty propagation: Analyze how local uncertainties contribute to the final confidence score. (c) Error analysis: Identify patterns in cases where PPD outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: A scientist is studying the effects of a new drug on blood pressure. In a clinical trial, 100 participants with high blood pressure were given the drug. Before the trial, the average blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg. After taking the drug for a month, 70% of participants showed a decrease in blood pressure, with an average reduction of 15 mmHg in systolic pressure and 8 mmHg in diastolic pressure. What was the average blood pressure of the participants after taking the drug?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) Initial average blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg\n2) 70% of participants showed a decrease:\n   - 15 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure\n   - 8 mmHg reduction in diastolic pressure\n3) For the 70% who responded:\n   - New systolic pressure: 150 - 15 = 135 mmHg\n   - New diastolic pressure: 90 - 8 = 82 mmHg\n4) For the 30% who didn't respond, we assume no change: 150/90 mmHg\n5) Calculate the weighted average:\n   Systolic: (0.7 * 135) + (0.3 * 150) = 94.5 + 45 = 139.5 mmHg\n   Diastolic: (0.7 * 82) + (0.3 * 90) = 57.4 + 27 = 84.4 mmHg\nTherefore, the average blood pressure after taking the drug was approximately 140/84 mmHg.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: A scientist is studying the effects of a new drug on blood pressure. In a clinical trial, 100 participants with high blood pressure were given the drug. Before the trial, the average blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg. After taking the drug for a month, 70% of participants showed a decrease in blood pressure, with an average reduction of 15 mmHg in systolic pressure and 8 mmHg in diastolic pressure. What was the average blood pressure of the participants after taking the drug?\n\nLet's break this problem down into smaller sub-queries:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Sub-queries:\n1. What was the initial average blood pressure?\n2. What percentage of participants showed a decrease in blood pressure?\n3. What was the average reduction in systolic pressure for those who responded?\n4. What was the average reduction in diastolic pressure for those who responded?\n5. What was the new blood pressure for participants who responded to the drug?\n6. What was the blood pressure for participants who didn't respond to the drug?\n7. How do we calculate the weighted average blood pressure after the trial?\n\nNow, let's answer each sub-query:\n1. Initial average blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg\n2. Percentage of participants who showed a decrease: 70%\n3. Average reduction in systolic pressure: 15 mmHg\n4. Average reduction in diastolic pressure: 8 mmHg\n5. New blood pressure for responders: (150-15)/(90-8) = 135/82 mmHg\n6. Blood pressure for non-responders: Assumed to be unchanged at 150/90 mmHg\n7. Weighted average calculation:\n   Systolic: (0.7 * 135) + (0.3 * 150) = 139.5 mmHg\n   Diastolic: (0.7 * 82) + (0.3 * 90) = 84.4 mmHg\n\nFinal answer: The average blood pressure of the participants after taking the drug was approximately 140/84 mmHg.\n\nConfidence scores:\nSub-query 1: 100% (Given in the problem)\nSub-query 2: 100% (Given in the problem)\nSub-query 3: 100% (Given in the problem)\nSub-query 4: 100% (Given in the problem)\nSub-query 5: 95% (Simple calculation, but rounding may introduce slight uncertainty)\nSub-query 6: 80% (Assumption made about non-responders)\nSub-query 7: 90% (Calculation is straightforward, but involves previous uncertainties)\n\nOverall confidence: 92% (Weighted average of sub-query confidences)",
            "explanation": "The PPD method breaks down the complex query into manageable sub-queries, allowing for more precise uncertainty estimation at each step. This approach provides a more granular view of the model's confidence in different aspects of the problem-solving process, potentially leading to better-calibrated final outputs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed PPD method doesn't significantly improve performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the decomposition process to understand why it might not be effective. This could involve comparing the quality of decompositions across different types of questions or examining how the complexity of the decomposition tree affects performance. 2) Investigate alternative methods for combining local uncertainties, such as using more sophisticated graphical model techniques or machine learning approaches to learn optimal combination strategies. 3) Explore how PPD performs on different types of tasks or domains, which could lead to insights about where decomposition is most effective. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where PPD performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the approach. This could inform the development of hybrid methods that combine strengths of PPD and traditional approaches. 5) Investigate how PPD affects the interpretability of model outputs, which could be valuable even if raw performance doesn't improve significantly."
