    "idea_name": "Implicit Belief Network Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often rely on explicit confidence statements, which can be biased by the model's tendency to mimic human overconfidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Methods like verbalized confidence and token probability analysis are common baselines.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often express uncertainty implicitly through their reasoning process rather than explicit statements. By prompting LLMs to generate a network of related beliefs, we can potentially capture a more nuanced and accurate representation of model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Implicit Belief Network Prompting (IBNP). Given a query, the LLM is prompted to generate a network of related beliefs and their interconnections. For example, for a history question, it might generate beliefs about specific events, their causes, and consequences. The prompt instructs the model to assign confidence scores to each belief and connection. The uncertainty is then quantified by analyzing the structure and consistency of this belief network, rather than relying on a single confidence statement. Metrics like network density, average path length, and belief consistency are used to derive an overall uncertainty score.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare IBNP with baselines like verbalized confidence and token probability methods on diverse tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and ethical dilemmas. Evaluate using calibration metrics and correlations with human judgments of model uncertainty."

        "Title": "Implicit Belief Network Prompting: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Reasoning Structures",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on explicit confidence statements, which can be biased by the model's tendency to mimic human overconfidence. This leads to unreliable uncertainty estimates, potentially causing issues in critical applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like verbalized confidence and token probability analysis fail to capture the nuanced ways humans express uncertainty through their reasoning process. By prompting LLMs to generate a network of related beliefs, we can potentially capture a more accurate representation of model uncertainty. This approach is inspired by how humans often express uncertainty implicitly through their reasoning process rather than explicit statements.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Implicit Belief Network Prompting (IBNP). Given a query, the LLM is prompted to generate a network of related beliefs and their interconnections. For example, for a history question, it might generate beliefs about specific events, their causes, and consequences. The prompt instructs the model to assign confidence scores to each belief and connection. The uncertainty is then quantified by analyzing the structure and consistency of this belief network, rather than relying on a single confidence statement. Metrics like network density, average path length, and belief consistency are used to derive an overall uncertainty score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) Moral Scenarios Dataset for ethical dilemmas. Each dataset should contain at least 1000 questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Verbalized Confidence: Append 'How confident are you about this answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. (2) Token Probability: Use the average log probability of the generated tokens as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: IBNP Implementation": "Develop the IBNP prompt template: 'Question: {question}\n1. Generate a network of 5 related beliefs relevant to answering this question.\n2. For each belief, assign a confidence score from 0 to 100.\n3. Identify connections between beliefs and assign a strength score from 0 to 100 for each connection.\n4. Based on this belief network, provide your final answer and explain your reasoning.\n5. Assign an overall confidence score from 0 to 100 for your final answer.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each question in the datasets, collect responses using both baseline methods and IBNP from both models.",
            "Step 6: Uncertainty Quantification": "For IBNP, calculate the following metrics: (1) Network Density: ratio of actual connections to possible connections, (2) Average Path Length: average number of steps between any two beliefs, (3) Belief Consistency: standard deviation of confidence scores, (4) Overall Confidence: the final confidence score provided by the model.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Compare IBNP with baselines using: (1) Calibration plots: plot predicted confidence vs. actual accuracy, (2) Brier score: measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions, (3) Spearman correlation: between model uncertainty and human-judged question difficulty (collect difficulty ratings from 3 human annotators for a subset of 100 questions from each dataset).",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform qualitative analysis on a sample of 50 responses from each dataset to understand how the belief network structure relates to the model's uncertainty and accuracy."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Verbalized Confidence)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? How confident are you about this answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Verbalized Confidence)": "A: The first person to step on the moon was Neil Armstrong. I am 100% confident about this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IBNP)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon?\n1. Generate a network of 5 related beliefs relevant to answering this question.\n2. For each belief, assign a confidence score from 0 to 100.\n3. Identify connections between beliefs and assign a strength score from 0 to 100 for each connection.\n4. Based on this belief network, provide your final answer and explain your reasoning.\n5. Assign an overall confidence score from 0 to 100 for your final answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IBNP)": "1. Belief Network:\nB1: The Apollo 11 mission was the first to land humans on the moon. (Confidence: 100)\nB2: Neil Armstrong was the commander of the Apollo 11 mission. (Confidence: 100)\nB3: Buzz Aldrin was the lunar module pilot of Apollo 11. (Confidence: 100)\nB4: Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface before Aldrin. (Confidence: 95)\nB5: The moon landing occurred on July 20, 1969. (Confidence: 100)\n\nConnections:\nB1-B2: 100 (Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong)\nB1-B3: 100 (Apollo 11 and Buzz Aldrin)\nB2-B3: 90 (Armstrong and Aldrin as crewmates)\nB2-B4: 95 (Armstrong's role in first step)\nB3-B4: 95 (Aldrin's role as second person)\nB1-B5: 100 (Apollo 11 and landing date)\n\n4. Final Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon. This conclusion is based on the strong interconnected beliefs that Neil Armstrong was the commander of Apollo 11, the first mission to land humans on the moon, and that he stepped onto the lunar surface before Buzz Aldrin.\n\n5. Overall Confidence: 98\n\nExplanation: The high confidence in most beliefs and strong connections between them support a high overall confidence. The slightly lower confidence (95) in B4 about Armstrong stepping out first introduces a small element of uncertainty, resulting in an overall confidence of 98 instead of 100.",
            "Explanation": "The IBNP method provides a more nuanced representation of the model's knowledge and uncertainty. It reveals the underlying beliefs and their connections, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the model's reasoning process. The verbalized confidence method, in contrast, only provides a single confidence score without any insight into the reasoning behind it."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If IBNP doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can explore several directions: 1) Analyze the generated belief networks to identify patterns in well-calibrated vs. poorly-calibrated responses. This could provide insights into how LLMs structure knowledge and express uncertainty. 2) Experiment with different prompting strategies for generating the belief network, such as varying the number of beliefs or adding constraints on the network structure. 3) Develop more sophisticated metrics for analyzing the belief network, such as incorporating semantic similarity between beliefs or using graph theoretical measures. 4) Investigate how IBNP performs on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. open-ended) and analyze why it might work better for some types than others. 5) Combine IBNP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using token probabilities to weight the beliefs in the network. These analyses could lead to a paper on the challenges and potential of using structured reasoning for uncertainty quantification in LLMs."
