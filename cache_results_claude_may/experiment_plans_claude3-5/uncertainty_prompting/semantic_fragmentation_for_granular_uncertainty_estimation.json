        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often provide overly broad confidence estimates that fail to capture fine-grained uncertainties within complex responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches provide a single confidence score for an entire response, without distinguishing between different parts of the answer.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down responses into semantic fragments and estimating uncertainty for each fragment, we can potentially provide more nuanced and actionable uncertainty information.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Fragmentation for Granular Uncertainty Estimation (SFGUE), a prompting technique that decomposes model responses into semantic fragments and estimates uncertainty for each fragment separately. The model is first prompted to generate a response, then to break this response down into meaningful semantic units. For each unit, the model is asked to provide a confidence estimate and justification. These granular uncertainties are then visualized as a heat map overlaid on the original response, allowing for easy identification of high and low confidence regions. The technique also includes a step where the model reflects on patterns in its granular uncertainties to provide insights into its overall confidence structure.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SFGUE on long-form question answering tasks and text generation benchmarks. Compare against whole-response uncertainty estimation methods using fragment-wise calibration metrics and human evaluation of uncertainty visualization usefulness."

        "Title": "Semantic Fragmentation for Granular Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often provide overly broad confidence estimates that fail to capture fine-grained uncertainties within complex responses. This limits the usefulness of uncertainty information in applications requiring more nuanced understanding of model confidence.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide a single confidence score for an entire response, without distinguishing between different parts of the answer. This coarse-grained approach fails to capture the varying levels of certainty a model may have about different aspects of its response. By breaking down responses into semantic fragments and estimating uncertainty for each fragment, we can potentially provide more nuanced and actionable uncertainty information. This granular approach could significantly improve the interpretability and reliability of language model outputs in critical applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Fragmentation for Granular Uncertainty Estimation (SFGUE), a prompting technique that decomposes model responses into semantic fragments and estimates uncertainty for each fragment separately. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Semantic fragmentation, 3) Per-fragment uncertainty estimation, and 4) Uncertainty visualization and analysis. In the first step, the model is prompted to generate a response to the given query. Next, the model is asked to break this response down into meaningful semantic units. For each unit, the model is then prompted to provide a confidence estimate and justification. Finally, these granular uncertainties are visualized as a heat map overlaid on the original response, allowing for easy identification of high and low confidence regions. The technique also includes a step where the model reflects on patterns in its granular uncertainties to provide insights into its overall confidence structure.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets for evaluation: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 3) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning. These datasets cover a range of tasks that require different types of knowledge and reasoning, allowing us to test the generalizability of our method.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with a single confidence score request, and 2) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation. For direct prompting, we'll use the prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide a single confidence score from 0 to 100 for your entire answer. Question: [QUESTION]'. For Monte Carlo Dropout, we'll use the implementation provided in the transformers library, performing 30 forward passes with dropout enabled.",
            "Step 4: SFGUE Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation: 'Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]', b) Semantic fragmentation: 'Break down your previous answer into 3-5 meaningful semantic fragments.', c) Per-fragment uncertainty estimation: 'For each fragment, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 and a brief justification for your confidence level.', d) Reflection: 'Analyze the pattern of your confidence levels across fragments and provide insights into your overall certainty about the answer.'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method (baselines and SFGUE), we will evaluate: 1) Answer accuracy, 2) Calibration using Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 3) Spearman rank correlation between confidence scores and correctness, and 4) Human evaluation of uncertainty usefulness. For human evaluation, we will recruit 3 expert annotators to rate the helpfulness of uncertainty information on a 5-point Likert scale for 100 randomly sampled examples from each dataset.",
            "Step 6: Uncertainty Visualization": "Implement a heat map visualization where each semantic fragment is color-coded based on its confidence score (red for low confidence, green for high confidence). Generate these visualizations for 50 random examples from each dataset.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: 1) Compare the performance of SFGUE against baselines across all metrics, 2) Analyze patterns in fragment-level uncertainties (e.g., are certain types of information consistently associated with higher/lower confidence?), 3) Examine the model's reflections on its confidence patterns for insights into its uncertainty awareness, 4) Investigate any discrepancies between fragment-level and overall uncertainties.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component: 1) Remove the semantic fragmentation step and estimate uncertainty for arbitrary text chunks, 2) Remove the justification requirement from the uncertainty estimation step, 3) Vary the number of fragments (2, 5, 10) to understand its impact on granularity and performance."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Answer the following question and provide a single confidence score from 0 to 100 for your entire answer. Question: What is the capital of France, and in which year was the Eiffel Tower completed?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFGUE; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Please answer the following question: What is the capital of France, and in which year was the Eiffel Tower completed?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFGUE; Step 1: Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFGUE; Step 2: Semantic Fragmentation)": "Break down your previous answer into 3-5 meaningful semantic fragments.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFGUE; Step 2: Semantic Fragmentation)": "1. The capital of France is Paris\n2. The Eiffel Tower was completed\n3. The completion year was 1889",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFGUE; Step 3: Per-fragment Uncertainty Estimation)": "For each fragment, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 and a brief justification for your confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFGUE; Step 3: Per-fragment Uncertainty Estimation)": "1. The capital of France is Paris\nConfidence: 100\nJustification: This is a widely known and undisputed fact.\n\n2. The Eiffel Tower was completed\nConfidence: 100\nJustification: The existence and completion of the Eiffel Tower is a well-established historical fact.\n\n3. The completion year was 1889\nConfidence: 95\nJustification: I'm very confident about this date, but there's a small chance I might be off by a year or two.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SFGUE; Step 4: Reflection)": "Analyze the pattern of your confidence levels across fragments and provide insights into your overall certainty about the answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SFGUE; Step 4: Reflection)": "My confidence levels are consistently high across all fragments, with perfect certainty (100) for the first two fragments and very high certainty (95) for the third. This pattern reflects my strong overall confidence in the answer. The slight decrease in confidence for the exact completion year acknowledges the potential for minor historical date inaccuracies in my knowledge base. Overall, I'm highly certain about the main facts in the answer, with only a small reservation about the precise year.",
            "explanation": "The SFGUE method provides more granular and insightful uncertainty information compared to the baseline. It breaks down the answer into meaningful fragments, assigns confidence scores to each, and provides justifications. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the model's certainty levels for different parts of the answer. The reflection step adds an extra layer of insight into the model's overall confidence structure."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SFGUE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where SFGUE fails to provide more useful uncertainty estimates. This could reveal interesting patterns about model behavior and limitations of current uncertainty estimation techniques. 2) Investigate the relationship between semantic fragmentation and uncertainty estimation. We could analyze whether certain types of semantic units consistently lead to higher or lower confidence, which could provide insights into the model's knowledge representation. 3) Explore alternative fragmentation strategies, such as syntactic parsing or named entity recognition, to see if they provide more meaningful uncertainty breakdowns. 4) Examine the model's justifications for its confidence levels to understand its reasoning process and potentially identify systematic biases or errors in its uncertainty estimation. 5) Investigate how different prompting strategies for fragmentation and uncertainty estimation affect the results, which could lead to insights on optimal prompting for uncertainty quantification."
