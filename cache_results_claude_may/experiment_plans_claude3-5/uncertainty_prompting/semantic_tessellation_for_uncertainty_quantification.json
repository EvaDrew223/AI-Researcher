        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of model uncertainty, especially in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-dimensional uncertainty measures or rely on computationally expensive sampling techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from tessellation in art and mathematics, we propose that model uncertainty can be more accurately represented by decomposing queries into interconnected semantic tiles, each with its own uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Tessellation for Uncertainty Quantification (STUQ), a prompting method that breaks down a given query into a network of simpler, interconnected sub-queries. The process involves: 1) Query decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the main query into constituent elements (e.g., 'Decompose this question into simpler, related sub-questions'). 2) Semantic tiling: For each sub-query, generate multiple related queries that form a 'semantic neighborhood' (e.g., 'Generate 5 closely related questions for each sub-question'). 3) Tile-level confidence estimation: Obtain confidence scores for each tile using standard elicitation methods. 4) Uncertainty aggregation: Combine tile-level uncertainties using a graph-based algorithm that accounts for tile interdependencies. This approach allows for a more granular and contextually rich uncertainty representation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate STUQ against baseline methods on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and MMLU. We'll measure performance using calibration metrics, uncertainty decomposition quality (assessed by human experts), and correlation with task difficulty. Additionally, we'll analyze the method's effectiveness in identifying specific areas of model uncertainty within multi-step reasoning processes."

        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of model uncertainty, especially in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders the reliable deployment of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-dimensional uncertainty measures or rely on computationally expensive sampling techniques. These methods often struggle to provide a nuanced representation of uncertainty across different aspects of a complex query. Drawing inspiration from tessellation in art and mathematics, we propose that model uncertainty can be more accurately represented by decomposing queries into interconnected semantic tiles, each with its own uncertainty estimate. This approach allows for a more granular and contextually rich uncertainty representation, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Tessellation for Uncertainty Quantification (STUQ), a prompting method that breaks down a given query into a network of simpler, interconnected sub-queries. The process involves four main steps: 1) Query decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the main query into constituent elements. 2) Semantic tiling: For each sub-query, generate multiple related queries that form a 'semantic neighborhood'. 3) Tile-level confidence estimation: Obtain confidence scores for each tile using standard elicitation methods. 4) Uncertainty aggregation: Combine tile-level uncertainties using a graph-based algorithm that accounts for tile interdependencies.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and MMLU. Select a subset of 1000 questions from each dataset, ensuring a diverse range of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct answering with confidence score, 2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and 3) Ensemble of models. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs for these baselines.",
            "Step 3: STUQ Implementation": "Implement the STUQ method using the following sub-steps: a) Query decomposition: Prompt the model with 'Decompose this question into 3-5 simpler, related sub-questions:' followed by the main question. b) Semantic tiling: For each sub-question, prompt with 'Generate 3 closely related questions for the following sub-question:'. c) Tile-level confidence estimation: For each tile (original sub-question and related questions), prompt the model to answer and provide a confidence score (0-100). d) Uncertainty aggregation: Implement a graph-based algorithm that combines tile-level uncertainties, considering the relationships between tiles.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error), 2) Brier score, 3) AUROC for detecting correct vs. incorrect predictions.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their predictions and uncertainty estimates. b) Apply STUQ and record the decomposed questions, semantic tiles, individual confidence scores, and final aggregated uncertainty estimate. c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1) Compare STUQ against baselines using the evaluation metrics. 2) Analyze the quality of query decomposition and semantic tiling (manually review a subset). 3) Investigate how STUQ performs across different types of reasoning tasks and difficulty levels. 4) Examine cases where STUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

This may include: 1) Examining the quality of query decompositions to ensure they effectively break down complex problems. 2) Analyzing the semantic tiling process to verify if it generates relevant and diverse related questions. 3) Investigating the tile-level confidence estimation to check for consistency and accuracy. 4) Reviewing the uncertainty aggregation algorithm to ensure it appropriately weighs and combines tile-level uncertainties. Based on these analyses, we may refine the STUQ method, such as by improving the prompting strategies for decomposition and tiling, or by developing a more sophisticated aggregation algorithm. Additionally, we could explore combining STUQ with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies. If these refinements do not yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of why decomposition-based approaches struggle with certain types of problems, potentially uncovering insights about the limitations of current LLM reasoning capabilities."
