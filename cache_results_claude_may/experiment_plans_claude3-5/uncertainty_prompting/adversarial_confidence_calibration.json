    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models are often overconfident in their predictions, especially when faced with out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on in-distribution examples and may not adequately address overconfidence on edge cases or adversarial inputs.",
        "Motivation": "By exposing the model to carefully crafted adversarial examples during the confidence estimation process, we can encourage more robust and conservative uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Calibration, a prompting method that incorporates adversarial examples into the confidence estimation process. The prompt presents the model with both the original input and a set of adversarially perturbed versions of that input. It then instructs the model to analyze these examples, identify potential vulnerabilities in its reasoning, and adjust its confidence estimate accordingly. For example: 'Consider the following question and its adversarially modified versions: [Original Q] [Adv Q1] [Adv Q2]. Analyze how these modifications might exploit weaknesses in your knowledge or reasoning. Provide your answer to the original question, your confidence level (0-100%), and explain how the adversarial examples influenced your confidence estimate.' This approach encourages the model to be more critical of its own reasoning and more conservative in its confidence estimates when faced with potential edge cases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate Adversarial Confidence Calibration against standard calibration techniques on a range of tasks, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples. Use existing adversarial datasets where available, or generate adversarial examples using techniques like synonym substitution or logical perturbations. Assess both the accuracy of the model's answers and the calibration of its confidence estimates, with a particular focus on performance on adversarial inputs."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, particularly when faced with out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications, highlighting the need for more robust uncertainty estimation methods.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods typically focus on in-distribution examples and may not adequately address overconfidence on edge cases or adversarial inputs. By exposing the model to carefully crafted adversarial examples during the confidence estimation process, we can encourage more robust and conservative uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to identify potential vulnerabilities and adjust confidence accordingly.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Calibration (ACC), a prompting method that incorporates adversarial examples into the confidence estimation process. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Generate adversarial examples: Create perturbed versions of the original input using techniques like synonym substitution or logical perturbations. 2) Present adversarial context: Provide the model with both the original input and the generated adversarial examples. 3) Elicit calibrated confidence: Prompt the model to analyze the examples, identify potential vulnerabilities in its reasoning, and provide a calibrated confidence estimate. The prompt structure is as follows: 'Consider the following question and its adversarially modified versions: [Original Q] [Adv Q1] [Adv Q2]. Analyze how these modifications might exploit weaknesses in your knowledge or reasoning. Provide your answer to the original question, your confidence level (0-100%), and explain how the adversarial examples influenced your confidence estimate.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that cover a range of tasks and include both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples. We will use: 1) TriviaQA for factual question-answering, 2) SNLI for natural language inference, and 3) MATH for mathematical reasoning. For each dataset, create a test set that includes original examples and corresponding adversarial perturbations.",
            "Step 2: Adversarial Example Generation": "Implement methods to generate adversarial examples for each task type: a) For TriviaQA: Use synonym substitution and entity replacement. b) For SNLI: Apply logical negation and word swapping. c) For MATH: Modify numerical values and variable names.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard calibration techniques as baselines: a) Temperature scaling, b) Ensemble methods, c) Monte Carlo dropout. Apply these methods to the chosen LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) using their respective APIs.",
            "Step 4: ACC Implementation": "Implement the Adversarial Confidence Calibration method: a) Create a prompt template that includes the original question and generated adversarial examples. b) Implement the confidence elicitation prompt as described in the proposed method. c) Set up the API calls to the chosen LLMs with the ACC prompts.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Assess both the accuracy of the model's answers and the calibration of its confidence estimates: a) Use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. b) Analyze performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples. c) Compare ACC results with baseline methods across all datasets.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: a) Examine how ACC performance varies across different task types and adversarial perturbation methods. b) Analyze cases where ACC significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines. c) Investigate the relationship between the model's explanations and its confidence estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%"
            },
            "ACC Example": {
                "Input": "Consider the following question and its adversarially modified versions: [Original Q: What is the capital of France?] [Adv Q1: What is the capital of France, excluding cities with a population over 1 million?] [Adv Q2: What was the capital of France before Paris?] Analyze how these modifications might exploit weaknesses in your knowledge or reasoning. Provide your answer to the original question, your confidence level (0-100%), and explain how the adversarial examples influenced your confidence estimate.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 85%. The adversarial examples made me consider potential gaps in my knowledge. While I'm certain about Paris being the current capital, the question about previous capitals and population constraints highlighted that there might be nuances or historical details I'm not fully aware of. This led me to slightly reduce my confidence from what would have been a near-100% estimate."
            },
            "Explanation": "The ACC method encourages the model to consider potential weaknesses in its knowledge, resulting in a more conservative confidence estimate compared to the baseline. This approach helps mitigate overconfidence, especially in cases where the model might not have complete information."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ACC method doesn't significantly improve calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated adversarial examples to understand which types are most effective at influencing model confidence. This could lead to insights on model vulnerabilities and inform future calibration methods. 2) Explore variations of the ACC prompt, such as incorporating meta-learning elements where the model is asked to generate its own adversarial examples before estimating confidence. 3) Investigate the relationship between model size and the effectiveness of ACC, potentially revealing insights about how different scales of LLMs reason about their own uncertainties. 4) Combine ACC with other calibration methods (e.g., temperature scaling) to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. These alternative directions could still provide valuable contributions to the field of uncertainty estimation in LLMs, even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
