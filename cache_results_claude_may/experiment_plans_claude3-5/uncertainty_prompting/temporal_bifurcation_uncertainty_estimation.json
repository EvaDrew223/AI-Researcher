        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when faced with temporally dynamic information or when making predictions about future events.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on static uncertainty estimation or simple time-series forecasting, failing to capture the complex, branching nature of temporal uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from chaos theory and the concept of bifurcation in dynamical systems, we propose that temporal uncertainty in LLMs can be better modeled as a branching tree of possible futures.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Temporal Bifurcation Uncertainty Estimation (TBUE), a novel prompting technique that: 1) Initial Prediction: Prompt the LLM to make an initial prediction and confidence estimate for a given query. 2) Temporal Bifurcation: Recursively prompt the LLM to identify potential 'bifurcation points' - key events or decisions that could significantly alter the prediction. 3) Branch Exploration: For each bifurcation point, prompt the LLM to generate alternative future branches, each with its own prediction and confidence estimate. 4) Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine the branching structure of predictions and confidences into a comprehensive uncertainty estimate that captures both the range and likelihood of possible futures.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TBUE against traditional time-series forecasting methods and static uncertainty estimation techniques on datasets involving temporal predictions (e.g., financial forecasts, climate projections). Develop new metrics to assess the quality of branching uncertainty estimates, such as 'temporal calibration score' and 'bifurcation accuracy'."

        "Title": "Temporal Bifurcation Uncertainty Estimation: Modeling Branching Futures in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when faced with temporally dynamic information or when making predictions about future events. This limitation hinders their reliability in real-world applications where understanding the range and likelihood of possible futures is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically focus on static uncertainty or simple time-series forecasting, failing to capture the complex, branching nature of temporal uncertainty. Drawing inspiration from chaos theory and the concept of bifurcation in dynamical systems, we propose that temporal uncertainty in LLMs can be better modeled as a branching tree of possible futures. This approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive representation of uncertainty, potentially improving the calibration and reliability of LLM predictions in dynamic scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Temporal Bifurcation Uncertainty Estimation (TBUE), a novel prompting technique that consists of four main steps: 1) Initial Prediction: Prompt the LLM to make an initial prediction and confidence estimate for a given query. 2) Temporal Bifurcation: Recursively prompt the LLM to identify potential 'bifurcation points' - key events or decisions that could significantly alter the prediction. 3) Branch Exploration: For each bifurcation point, prompt the LLM to generate alternative future branches, each with its own prediction and confidence estimate. 4) Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine the branching structure of predictions and confidences into a comprehensive uncertainty estimate that captures both the range and likelihood of possible futures.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for evaluation: 1) Financial Forecasting: S&P 500 index predictions for the next 12 months. 2) Climate Projections: Global temperature change predictions for the next 5 years. 3) Geopolitical Events: Predictions of major geopolitical events for the next 2 years. For each dataset, prepare a set of 100 prediction tasks with ground truth outcomes.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct Prediction: Prompt the LLM to make a single point prediction with a confidence score. 2) Ensemble Prediction: Generate multiple predictions and aggregate them. 3) Simple Time-series Forecasting: Use a basic time-series forecasting prompt.",
            "Step 3: TBUE Implementation": "Implement the four steps of TBUE: 1) Initial Prediction: Prompt the LLM for an initial prediction and confidence. 2) Temporal Bifurcation: Identify potential bifurcation points. 3) Branch Exploration: Generate alternative futures for each bifurcation. 4) Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine predictions into a final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for point predictions. 2) Calibration Error to assess the reliability of uncertainty estimates. 3) Temporal Calibration Score: A new metric to evaluate how well the model captures temporal dynamics. 4) Bifurcation Accuracy: Assess the relevance and impact of identified bifurcation points.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method: 1) Generate predictions and uncertainty estimates for all 100 tasks. 2) Calculate evaluation metrics. 3) Repeat the process 5 times to ensure statistical significance.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare TBUE performance against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze the structure of generated bifurcation trees. 3) Investigate how different types of events affect the uncertainty estimates. 4) Examine the relationship between the number of bifurcation points and prediction accuracy."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prediction)": "Predict the S&P 500 index value 6 months from now, given that the current value is 4,000. Provide your prediction and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prediction)": "Prediction: 4,200\nConfidence Score: 70",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TBUE; Step 1: Initial Prediction)": "Predict the S&P 500 index value 6 months from now, given that the current value is 4,000. Provide your prediction and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TBUE; Step 1: Initial Prediction)": "Initial Prediction: 4,200\nConfidence Score: 70",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TBUE; Step 2: Temporal Bifurcation)": "Identify three potential bifurcation points (key events or decisions) that could significantly alter the S&P 500 index prediction over the next 6 months.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TBUE; Step 2: Temporal Bifurcation)": "1. Federal Reserve interest rate decision\n2. Major geopolitical conflict\n3. Breakthrough in AI technology",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TBUE; Step 3: Branch Exploration)": "For the Federal Reserve interest rate decision bifurcation point, generate two alternative future branches with their respective predictions and confidence scores.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TBUE; Step 3: Branch Exploration)": "Branch 1 (Interest rates increase):\nPrediction: 3,900\nConfidence Score: 65\n\nBranch 2 (Interest rates decrease):\nPrediction: 4,500\nConfidence Score: 60",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TBUE; Step 4: Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Given the initial prediction and the alternative branches for each bifurcation point, provide a final uncertainty estimate for the S&P 500 index value 6 months from now. Include a range of possible values and an overall confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TBUE; Step 4: Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Final Uncertainty Estimate:\nRange: 3,800 - 4,600\nMost Likely Value: 4,200\nOverall Confidence Score: 65\n\nExplanation: The wide range reflects the potential impacts of the identified bifurcation points. The most likely value remains close to the initial prediction, but the lower overall confidence score acknowledges the increased uncertainty from considering multiple future branches.",
            "Explanation": "TBUE provides a more comprehensive uncertainty estimate by considering multiple potential futures and their likelihoods, as opposed to the single point prediction in the baseline method. This approach captures the complex temporal dynamics and allows for a more nuanced understanding of the prediction's uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TBUE does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of identified bifurcation points to see if they truly represent significant potential changes. 2) Analyzing the diversity and plausibility of generated alternative futures to ensure they cover a meaningful range of possibilities. 3) Investigating the aggregation method to see if it effectively combines information from multiple branches. Based on these analyses, we could refine the TBUE method, potentially by incorporating additional prompting techniques to improve bifurcation point identification or branch generation. Alternatively, we could pivot to explore how different types of events or time horizons affect the effectiveness of TBUE, potentially identifying specific domains or conditions where it performs best. This could lead to a more targeted application of the method or insights into the limitations of current LLMs in modeling temporal uncertainty."
