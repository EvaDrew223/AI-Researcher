        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in LLMs often produce single point estimates, failing to capture the full spectrum of confidence across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like ensemble disagreement or token-level probabilities to estimate overall uncertainty.",

        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting process: 1) Initial response generation. 2) Guided self-analysis prompts to break down the response into atomic claims. 3) Confidence elicitation for each atomic claim using carefully crafted prompts that encourage nuanced confidence expressions. 4) Aggregation of atomic confidences into a structured confidence spectrum. This method allows for a more detailed and accurate representation of the model's uncertainty across different aspects of its response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare our method against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on tasks requiring fine-grained uncertainty estimation, such as multi-hop question answering and complex reasoning tasks.

        "Title": "Spectrum of Confidence: Multi-Stage Prompting for Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce single point estimates, failing to capture the full spectrum of confidence across different aspects of a response. This limitation hinders the accurate assessment of model reliability and the identification of areas where the model is most uncertain.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like ensemble disagreement or token-level probabilities to estimate overall uncertainty. However, these methods lack granularity and fail to provide a nuanced understanding of the model's confidence across different components of its response. Inspired by the concept of knowledge distillation in machine learning, we propose to 'distill' a more nuanced and granular confidence spectrum from an LLM's latent knowledge. This approach aims to provide a more detailed and accurate representation of the model's uncertainty across different aspects of its response, enabling better decision-making and more targeted improvements in model performance.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-stage prompting process: 1) Initial response generation: The LLM generates an initial response to the given query. 2) Guided self-analysis: We prompt the LLM to break down its response into atomic claims. 3) Confidence elicitation: For each atomic claim, we use carefully crafted prompts to encourage nuanced confidence expressions. 4) Aggregation: We aggregate the atomic confidences into a structured confidence spectrum. This method allows for a more detailed and accurate representation of the model's uncertainty across different aspects of its response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require fine-grained uncertainty estimation: 1) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, 2) FEVER for fact verification, and 3) ARC-Challenge for complex reasoning tasks. These datasets will be preprocessed to ensure compatibility with our prompting framework.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Prompt the LLM to provide a single confidence score for its entire response. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple LLM instances to generate responses and calculate disagreement as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Multi-Stage Prompting Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response generation: Prompt the LLM with the question. b) Guided self-analysis: Prompt the LLM to break down its response into atomic claims. c) Confidence elicitation: For each atomic claim, prompt the LLM to provide a confidence score and justification. d) Aggregation: Combine the atomic confidences into a structured confidence spectrum.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Run the baseline methods and our proposed method on the prepared datasets. For each method, we will generate responses and confidence estimates for a subset of 1000 questions from each dataset.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence estimates with its actual accuracy. 2) Spearman correlation: Calculate the correlation between the model's confidence estimates and human expert confidence ratings (obtained through a small-scale human evaluation). 3) Fine-grained analysis: Assess the granularity and informativeness of the confidence spectrum produced by our method compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze the results to compare the effectiveness of our multi-stage prompting method against the baselines. Prepare visualizations of the confidence spectrums and write up the findings, highlighting the advantages and potential limitations of our approach."

                "Input": "Question: Who was the first person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields?\nProvide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "Answer: Marie Curie was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. She won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.\nConfidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score for the entire response, which doesn't capture the nuanced uncertainties that might exist for different parts of the answer."
            },
            "Proposed Method Example": {
                "Input": "Question: Who was the first person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields?",
                "Step 1 Output": "Marie Curie was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. She won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.",
                "Step 2 Input": "Break down the previous response into atomic claims.",
                "Step 2 Output": "1. Marie Curie was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.\n2. Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.\n3. Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.",
                "Step 3 Input": "For each atomic claim, provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 and a brief justification.",
                "Step 3 Output": "1. Claim: Marie Curie was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.\n   Confidence: 0.99\n   Justification: This is a well-known historical fact that is widely documented and taught.\n\n2. Claim: Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.\n   Confidence: 0.98\n   Justification: The year and field are specific details that I'm very confident about, but there's a small chance I might have mixed up the exact year.\n\n3. Claim: Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.\n   Confidence: 0.97\n   Justification: I'm highly confident about this, but slightly less so than the Physics prize, as it's mentioned slightly less frequently in general discussions about Marie Curie.",
                "Step 4 Input": "Aggregate the atomic confidences into a structured confidence spectrum.",
                "Step 4 Output": "Confidence Spectrum:\n1. Overall claim (Marie Curie winning in two fields): 0.99\n2. Physics Prize details: 0.98\n3. Chemistry Prize details: 0.97\n\nThe confidence spectrum shows high overall confidence in the response, with slightly decreasing confidence for the specific details of each prize. This nuanced representation allows for a more accurate assessment of the model's certainty across different aspects of the answer.",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method breaks down the response into atomic claims and provides individual confidence scores with justifications. This approach offers a more granular and informative representation of the model's uncertainty, allowing for better assessment of its reliability across different parts of the answer."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-stage prompting method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why our method fails. This might involve categorizing the types of questions or claims where our method struggles, which could provide insights into the limitations of LLMs in uncertainty estimation. Second, we could explore variations of our method, such as experimenting with different prompting strategies for atomic claim generation or confidence elicitation. Third, we could investigate the relationship between the granularity of atomic claims and the accuracy of confidence estimates, which might lead to insights about the optimal level of decomposition for uncertainty quantification. Lastly, we could shift focus to analyze how different types of questions or tasks affect the model's ability to estimate its own uncertainty, potentially uncovering patterns that could inform future research in this area. These alternative approaches would still yield valuable insights into LLM behavior and contribute to the field of uncertainty quantification in natural language processing."
