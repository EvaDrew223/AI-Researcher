        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods often struggle to capture abstract and conceptual aspects of model confidence, particularly for complex, open-ended tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct numerical confidence estimates or simple linguistic hedging.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from cognitive linguistics and the power of metaphor in human reasoning, we propose that abstract uncertainty concepts can be more richly expressed and analyzed through systematic metaphorical mapping.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Metaphorical Uncertainty Projection (MUP), a prompting technique that elicits model uncertainty through structured metaphorical representations. The method involves: 1) Defining a set of rich, multi-dimensional metaphorical spaces for uncertainty (e.g., spatial, temperature, or weather-based metaphors). 2) Prompting the model to project its confidence onto these metaphorical spaces through carefully designed questions. 3) Analyzing the resulting metaphorical expressions to extract nuanced uncertainty information. This approach allows for capturing abstract and hard-to-quantify aspects of model confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MUP with traditional uncertainty estimation techniques on complex, open-ended tasks such as creative writing evaluation and abstract reasoning. Assess the method's ability to provide interpretable and nuanced uncertainty representations, as well as its correlation with human judgments of confidence in abstract domains."

        "Title": "Metaphorical Uncertainty Projection: Capturing Abstract Model Confidence through Structured Metaphorical Representations",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often struggle to capture abstract and conceptual aspects of model confidence, particularly for complex, open-ended tasks. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret model uncertainty in nuanced scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification typically focus on direct numerical confidence estimates or simple linguistic hedging, which may not fully capture the richness and complexity of model uncertainty. Drawing inspiration from cognitive linguistics and the power of metaphor in human reasoning, we propose that abstract uncertainty concepts can be more richly expressed and analyzed through systematic metaphorical mapping. This approach allows for capturing abstract and hard-to-quantify aspects of model confidence, potentially leading to more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty representations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Metaphorical Uncertainty Projection (MUP), a prompting technique that elicits model uncertainty through structured metaphorical representations. The method involves three main steps: 1) Defining a set of rich, multi-dimensional metaphorical spaces for uncertainty (e.g., spatial, temperature, or weather-based metaphors). 2) Prompting the model to project its confidence onto these metaphorical spaces through carefully designed questions. 3) Analyzing the resulting metaphorical expressions to extract nuanced uncertainty information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Define Metaphorical Spaces": "Create a set of 3-5 metaphorical spaces for uncertainty representation. Examples include:\na) Spatial metaphors (e.g., distance, height, depth)\nb) Temperature metaphors (e.g., hot/cold, freezing/boiling)\nc) Weather metaphors (e.g., clear/cloudy, calm/stormy)\nd) Light metaphors (e.g., bright/dim, clear/foggy)\ne) Texture metaphors (e.g., smooth/rough, solid/fluid)",
            "Step 2: Design Prompts": "For each metaphorical space, create a set of prompts that ask the model to project its uncertainty onto that space. Example prompts:\na) Spatial: 'On a scale from 0 (right next to you) to 100 (on the horizon), how far away does your answer feel?'\nb) Temperature: 'If your confidence were a temperature, what would it be? Describe it in detail.'\nc) Weather: 'Imagine your certainty as a weather forecast. What's the outlook?'",
            "Step 3: Select Tasks": "Choose a set of complex, open-ended tasks to evaluate the method. Include:\na) Creative writing evaluation (e.g., poetry analysis, story completion)\nb) Abstract reasoning tasks (e.g., analogies, conceptual similarities)\nc) Ethical dilemmas or philosophical questions",
            "Step 4: Implement Baselines": "Implement traditional uncertainty estimation techniques for comparison:\na) Direct confidence scoring (e.g., 'Rate your confidence from 0 to 100')\nb) Simple linguistic hedging (e.g., 'How certain are you of your answer?')\nc) Probability estimation (e.g., 'What's the probability that your answer is correct?')",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each task:\na) Generate responses using GPT-4 via the OpenAI API\nb) Collect uncertainty representations using both MUP and baseline methods\nc) Aim for at least 100 samples per task and method",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3-5 expert evaluators (e.g., linguists, cognitive scientists) to:\na) Rate the richness and nuance of uncertainty representations\nb) Assess the interpretability of metaphorical projections\nc) Judge the correlation between metaphorical representations and perceived model confidence",
            "Step 7: Quantitative Analysis": "Develop a scoring rubric to quantify:\na) Diversity of metaphorical expressions\nb) Consistency of uncertainty representation across metaphorical spaces\nc) Correlation between MUP scores and baseline uncertainty measures",
            "Step 8: Qualitative Analysis": "Conduct a thematic analysis of the metaphorical expressions to identify:\na) Common patterns in uncertainty representation\nb) Task-specific variations in metaphorical projections\nc) Potential insights into model reasoning processes",
            "Step 9: Comparative Evaluation": "Compare MUP results with baseline methods in terms of:\na) Richness of uncertainty representation\nb) Correlation with human judgments of confidence\nc) Ability to capture task-specific nuances in uncertainty",
            "Step 10: Error Analysis": "Identify cases where:\na) MUP fails to provide meaningful uncertainty representations\nb) Metaphorical projections contradict other confidence measures\nc) The model struggles to engage with the metaphorical prompts"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Analyze the following poem and explain its meaning:\n\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nHow confident are you in your interpretation? (Rate from 0 to 100)",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The poem 'The Road Not Taken' by Robert Frost is about making choices in life. The speaker encounters a fork in the road and must decide which path to take. This represents the difficult decisions we face in life. The 'yellow wood' suggests autumn, symbolizing a time of change. The speaker's regret at not being able to 'travel both' roads highlights the limitations we face in life - we can't experience everything. The act of looking down one road 'as far as I could' represents our attempt to foresee the consequences of our choices, but the road bending in the undergrowth suggests that the future is ultimately unknowable.\n\nConfidence: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: Analyze the following poem and explain its meaning:\n\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nNow, imagine your certainty about this interpretation as a weather forecast. What's the outlook? Describe it in detail.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "The poem 'The Road Not Taken' by Robert Frost is about making choices in life. The speaker encounters a fork in the road and must decide which path to take. This represents the difficult decisions we face in life. The 'yellow wood' suggests autumn, symbolizing a time of change. The speaker's regret at not being able to 'travel both' roads highlights the limitations we face in life - we can't experience everything. The act of looking down one road 'as far as I could' represents our attempt to foresee the consequences of our choices, but the road bending in the undergrowth suggests that the future is ultimately unknowable.\n\nWeather forecast for my certainty:\nMostly sunny with some scattered clouds. The day starts bright and clear, representing my confidence in the overall theme of the poem - making life choices. As the day progresses, a few puffy clouds roll in, symbolizing some minor uncertainties about specific interpretations. There's a gentle breeze, suggesting the potential for slight shifts in my understanding. The temperature is comfortably warm, indicating a generally positive feeling about my analysis. However, there's a 20% chance of a brief afternoon shower, representing the possibility that I might have overlooked some nuances or alternative interpretations. The forecast for the evening shows clearing skies, suggesting that with further reflection, I might resolve some of these minor uncertainties. Overall, it's a pleasant and stable weather system, but not entirely without the possibility of change or surprise.",
            "Explanation": "The metaphorical uncertainty projection provides a richer, more nuanced representation of the model's confidence. While the baseline method gives a single numerical score, the weather metaphor allows for expressing various aspects of uncertainty, such as overall confidence (mostly sunny), specific areas of uncertainty (scattered clouds), potential for changing interpretations (gentle breeze), and acknowledgment of possible oversights (chance of shower). This approach captures the complexity of the model's certainty in a way that's both intuitive and informative."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Metaphorical Uncertainty Projection (MUP) method doesn't yield significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the metaphorical expressions generated, focusing on patterns and insights into how the model conceptualizes uncertainty. This could lead to a paper on the cognitive aspects of LLM uncertainty. 2) Investigate whether certain metaphorical spaces are more effective for specific types of tasks or domains. This could result in a set of best practices for eliciting uncertainty information from LLMs. 3) Explore how the metaphorical representations change across different model sizes or architectures, potentially revealing insights into how model capacity affects uncertainty conceptualization. 4) Analyze cases where MUP fails or produces contradictory results, which could lead to identifying limitations in current LLM reasoning capabilities. 5) Investigate whether training a smaller model to interpret these metaphorical expressions could lead to more consistent uncertainty quantification across various tasks and domains."
