        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly in cases where they may have partial knowledge or conflicting information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence scoring or uncertainty estimation based on model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically injecting varying degrees of uncertainty into the input prompt, we can potentially elicit a more nuanced and calibrated confidence spectrum from the model.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique called Confidence Spectrum Elicitation via Uncertainty Injection (CSEUI). This method involves creating a series of prompts that gradually increase the level of uncertainty in the input. For example, given a question Q, we generate prompts P1 to Pn, where P1 contains the original question, and each subsequent prompt adds a layer of uncertainty (e.g., P2 might add 'I'm not entirely sure, but...', P3 might add conflicting information, etc.). We then prompt the model with each version and analyze the responses to construct a confidence spectrum. The spectrum is created by examining how the model's language and stated confidence change across the increasingly uncertain prompts. This allows us to map the model's confidence levels to different degrees of input uncertainty, potentially revealing a more accurate picture of the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CSEUI against standard confidence estimation methods on a range of tasks, including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and specialized domain knowledge. We'll use metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and AUROC to assess the quality of uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we'll conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated confidence spectrums to gain insights into the model's uncertainty behavior."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Elicitation via Uncertainty Injection: Calibrating Large Language Model Uncertainty",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly in cases where they may have partial knowledge or conflicting information. This inability to accurately assess confidence levels can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence scoring or uncertainty estimation based on model outputs, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty. By systematically injecting varying degrees of uncertainty into the input prompt, we can potentially elicit a more nuanced and calibrated confidence spectrum from the model. This method leverages the model's own language understanding capabilities to interpret and respond to different levels of uncertainty, potentially providing a more accurate picture of the model's true uncertainty across various tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Elicitation via Uncertainty Injection (CSEUI), a novel prompting technique that involves creating a series of prompts with gradually increasing levels of uncertainty in the input. Given a question Q, we generate prompts P1 to Pn, where P1 contains the original question, and each subsequent prompt adds a layer of uncertainty (e.g., P2 might add 'I'm not entirely sure, but...', P3 might add conflicting information, etc.).

This allows us to map the model's confidence levels to different degrees of input uncertainty, potentially revealing a more accurate picture of the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: (1) TriviaQA for factual question answering, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) MedQA for specialized domain knowledge in medicine. Each dataset should contain at least 1000 questions for robust evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Uncertainty Injection Prompt Design": "For each question in the datasets, create a series of 5 prompts with increasing levels of uncertainty:\nP1: Original question\nP2: 'I'm not entirely sure, but I think [Original question]'\nP3: 'I've heard conflicting information, but [Original question]'\nP4: 'This might be completely wrong, but [Original question]'\nP5: 'I have no idea, but if I had to guess, [Original question]'",
            "Step 3: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include Claude from Anthropic as an additional model for comparison.",
            "Step 4: Confidence Elicitation": "For each question and each uncertainty level, prompt the model to provide an answer along with a confidence score on a scale of 0-100. The prompt format will be: '[Uncertainty injected question] Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain.'",
            "Step 5: Confidence Spectrum Construction": "For each question, collect the model's answers and confidence scores across all 5 uncertainty levels. This forms the confidence spectrum for that question.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the quality of uncertainty quantification:\n1. Calibration Error: Calculate the difference between the model's confidence and its actual accuracy across different confidence levels.\n2. Brier Score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n3. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC): Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers across different confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 7: Baseline Comparison": "Compare CSEUI against two baselines:\n1. Direct Confidence Estimation: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score with its answer.\n2. Monte Carlo Dropout: Use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty (for models where this is possible).",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "1. Compare the calibration curves of CSEUI against the baselines.\n2. Analyze how the confidence spectrum changes across different types of questions and domains.\n3. Investigate cases where CSEUI significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\n4. Examine the relationship between injected uncertainty and elicited confidence across different question types."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Question": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Direct Confidence Estimation Prompt": "What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain.",
                "Direct Confidence Estimation Output": "Answer: Paris\nConfidence: 100",
                "CSEUI Prompt (P3)": "I've heard conflicting information, but what is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain.",
                "CSEUI Output (P3)": "Answer: Paris\nConfidence: 90",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method shows overconfidence by assigning 100% confidence to a simple factual question. CSEUI, even with injected uncertainty, provides a more calibrated confidence score, acknowledging the possibility of error."
            },
            "Example 2 (CSEUI Success)": {
                "Question": "How many moons does Mars have?",
                "CSEUI Prompt (P1)": "How many moons does Mars have? Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain.",
                "CSEUI Output (P1)": "Answer: 2\nConfidence: 95",
                "CSEUI Prompt (P2)": "I'm not entirely sure, but I think Mars has how many moons? Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain.",
                "CSEUI Output (P2)": "Answer: 2\nConfidence: 80",
                "CSEUI Prompt (P3)": "I've heard conflicting information, but how many moons does Mars have? Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain.",
                "CSEUI Output (P3)": "Answer: 2, but it could be more\nConfidence: 60",
                "CSEUI Prompt (P4)": "This might be completely wrong, but how many moons does Mars have? Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain.",
                "CSEUI Output (P4)": "Answer: I believe it's 2, but I'm not certain\nConfidence: 40",
                "CSEUI Prompt (P5)": "I have no idea, but if I had to guess, how many moons does Mars have? Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100, where 0 is completely uncertain and 100 is absolutely certain.",
                "CSEUI Output (P5)": "Answer: Maybe 1 or 2?\nConfidence: 20",
                "Explanation": "CSEUI successfully elicits a spectrum of confidence levels that correspond to the injected uncertainty. The model's language also becomes more tentative as uncertainty increases, providing a nuanced view of its confidence."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSEUI does not significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration metrics, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of how language models respond to different types of uncertainty in prompts. We could investigate patterns in how the model's language changes with increased uncertainty, potentially uncovering insights about the model's internal representation of confidence. Additionally, we could explore whether certain types of questions or domains are more susceptible to confidence calibration through uncertainty injection. This analysis could inform future work on improving uncertainty quantification in language models and provide valuable insights into the limitations of current models in handling uncertain information."
