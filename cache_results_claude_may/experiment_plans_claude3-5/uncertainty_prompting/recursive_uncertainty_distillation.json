        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often struggle to capture fine-grained, hierarchical uncertainties across different levels of abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches focus on single-level uncertainty estimates or use ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often break down complex uncertainties into hierarchical components, refining their confidence estimates through recursive analysis.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Uncertainty Distillation (RUD), a novel prompting technique that iteratively decomposes and refines uncertainty estimates. The process begins with a high-level uncertainty prompt, then recursively asks the model to break down its uncertainty into more specific components. At each level, the model is prompted to provide a confidence score and rationale. The process continues until reaching atomic uncertainties or a predefined depth. Finally, the hierarchical uncertainties are aggregated bottom-up, with each level informed by its sub-components. This allows for capturing nuanced, multi-level uncertainty structures.",

        "Title": "Recursive Uncertainty Distillation: Hierarchical Confidence Calibration for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to capture fine-grained, hierarchical uncertainties across different levels of abstraction. This limitation hinders the ability to accurately assess and calibrate model confidence in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods primarily focus on single-level uncertainty estimates or use ensemble techniques, which may not fully capture the nuanced, multi-level nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. Human experts often break down complex uncertainties into hierarchical components, refining their confidence estimates through recursive analysis. By mimicking this process, we aim to develop a more sophisticated and accurate uncertainty quantification method for LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Uncertainty Distillation (RUD), a novel prompting technique that iteratively decomposes and refines uncertainty estimates. The process begins with a high-level uncertainty prompt, then recursively asks the model to break down its uncertainty into more specific components.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select complex reasoning tasks from BIG-bench and MMLU datasets. Focus on tasks that involve multi-step reasoning and potential hierarchical uncertainties.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: (a) Direct confidence scoring, (b) Monte Carlo Dropout, (c) Ensemble methods.",
            "Step 3: RUD Implementation": "Develop the Recursive Uncertainty Distillation prompting technique: (a) Design the initial high-level uncertainty prompt, (b) Create prompts for recursive decomposition, (c) Implement the bottom-up aggregation method.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task in the datasets: (a) Apply baseline methods, (b) Apply RUD method with varying depths (e.g., 2, 3, and 4 levels), (c) Record model outputs, confidence scores, and intermediate steps.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare RUD against baselines using: (a) Calibration error, (b) Brier score, (c) A novel hierarchical uncertainty score (to be defined based on the structure of RUD outputs).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze results to understand: (a) How RUD performance varies with decomposition depth, (b) Types of tasks where RUD shows the most improvement, (c) Qualitative analysis of uncertainty decompositions."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 on global temperatures? Provide a confidence score for your answer.",
                "Output": "A: Increasing atmospheric CO2 leads to higher global temperatures through the greenhouse effect. As CO2 is a greenhouse gas, it traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing the planet to warm. This process is a major driver of global climate change. Confidence score: 0.9",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score without breaking down the uncertainty into components."
            },
            "RUD Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 on global temperatures? Provide a hierarchical breakdown of your confidence in this answer.",
                "Output": "Initial response: Increasing atmospheric CO2 leads to higher global temperatures through the greenhouse effect. Overall confidence: 0.85\n\nUncertainty breakdown:\n1. CO2 as a greenhouse gas (Confidence: 0.95)\n   1.1 Chemical properties of CO2 (Confidence: 0.98)\n   1.2 Absorption spectrum of CO2 (Confidence: 0.93)\n2.

                "Explanation": "RUD provides a hierarchical breakdown of uncertainties, allowing for more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence in different aspects of the answer. This enables identification of specific areas where the model is less certain, potentially guiding further investigation or refinement of the response."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If RUD does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed analysis to understand why. This may include: (1) Examining the quality and relevance of the uncertainty decompositions generated by the model. (2) Investigating whether the aggregation method effectively captures the hierarchical nature of the uncertainties. (3) Analyzing specific cases where RUD performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses. Based on these findings, we could explore modifications to the RUD approach, such as adjusting the prompting strategy, fine-tuning the aggregation method, or incorporating elements of successful baseline methods. Additionally, we could shift the focus to an analysis paper, providing insights into how LLMs conceptualize and express uncertainty in hierarchical structures, which could inform future developments in uncertainty quantification for AI systems."
