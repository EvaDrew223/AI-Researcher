        "Title": "Confidence Gradient Mapping: Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different parts of their generated responses, leading to inconsistent confidence levels within a single output. This inconsistency can result in unreliable outputs, especially in critical applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on global confidence scores or simple token-level probabilities, which fail to capture the nuanced uncertainty patterns within model outputs. Inspired by gradient-based saliency maps in computer vision, we propose to map confidence gradients across generated text to provide fine-grained uncertainty quantification. This method allows for a more detailed understanding of model uncertainty, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Gradient Mapping (CGM), which involves the following steps: 1) Generate an initial response. 2) Iteratively mask each token and measure the change in perplexity of surrounding context. 3) Compute a confidence gradient for each token based on perplexity changes. 4) Visualize the gradient map and use it to refine uncertain segments. The prompt includes instructions for the model to perform these steps and interpret the resulting gradient map.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: 1) Long-form question answering dataset from ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five). 2) Document summarization dataset from CNN/DailyMail. These datasets are suitable for evaluating fine-grained uncertainty as they require generating longer, more complex outputs.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Global confidence scoring: Use the model's overall output probability as a single confidence score. 2) Token-level probabilities: Use the model's predicted probability for each token as a local confidence score.",
            "Step 3: CGM Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Gradient Mapping method: a) Generate initial response. b) For each token, mask it and compute perplexity change in a window of 5 tokens before and after. c) Compute confidence gradient based on perplexity changes. d) Normalize gradients to [0, 1] range for visualization and comparison.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of CGM: 1) Initial response generation. 2) Token masking and perplexity computation. 3) Gradient computation. 4) Interpretation and refinement based on the gradient map.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Token-level calibration: Compare predicted confidence (from baselines and CGM) with human judgments of correctness. 2) Uncertainty alignment: Measure correlation between model uncertainty and human-perceived uncertainty. 3) Refinement quality: Assess improvement in output quality after CGM-guided refinement.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation Setup": "Recruit 3 expert annotators to judge: 1) Token-level correctness of model outputs. 2) Perceived uncertainty for each segment of the output. 3) Quality of refined outputs.",
            "Step 8: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: 1) Generate responses using baseline methods and CGM. 2) Compute evaluation metrics. 3) Conduct human evaluation. 4) Compare performance of CGM against baselines.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "1) Compare CGM performance against baselines across different tasks and models. 2) Analyze patterns in confidence gradients and their correlation with output quality. 3) Investigate cases where CGM significantly improves or fails to improve over baselines."

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CGM; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, primarily in the leaves. The process involves several steps: 1) Light absorption by chlorophyll. 2) Water splitting to produce oxygen. 3) Carbon dioxide fixation to produce glucose. [Full explanation...]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CGM; Step 2: Compute Gradients)": "For each token in the response, mask it and compute the perplexity change in a window of 5 tokens before and after. Then, compute the confidence gradient based on these perplexity changes.",

            "Proposed Prompt Input (CGM; Step 3: Interpret and Refine)": "Based on the computed confidence gradients, identify areas of low confidence and refine the explanation to improve those parts:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CGM; Step 3: Interpret and Refine)": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, primarily in the leaves. The process involves several key steps: 1) Light absorption: Chlorophyll and other pigments in the thylakoid membranes absorb light energy. 2) Water splitting: Light energy is used to split water molecules, producing oxygen as a byproduct. This occurs in the oxygen-evolving complex of Photosystem II. 3) Electron transport chain: Electrons from the split water molecules are passed through a series of proteins, generating ATP and NADPH. 4) Carbon fixation: In the Calvin cycle, which occurs in the stroma, CO2 is fixed into organic compounds using the ATP and NADPH generated in the previous steps. This ultimately produces glucose and other carbohydrates. [Further refined explanation...]",
            "explanation": "The CGM method allows for a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence across different parts of the explanation. By identifying areas of low confidence (indicated by high gradients), the model can focus on refining those specific parts, resulting in a more accurate and detailed explanation. This is particularly evident in the expanded explanations of the light absorption and water splitting steps, which were likely areas of lower confidence in the initial response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CGM method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why CGM is not effective. This could involve examining the relationship between perplexity changes and actual output quality. 2) Explore alternative gradient computation methods, such as using attention weights or intermediate layer activations instead of perplexity. 3) Investigate how CGM performance varies across different types of tasks or question complexities. This could lead to insights about when fine-grained uncertainty quantification is most beneficial. 4) Combine CGM with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to see if there are synergistic effects. 5) If CGM shows promise in identifying uncertain areas but struggles with refinement, we could focus on developing better strategies for using the gradient information to guide targeted improvements in the output."
