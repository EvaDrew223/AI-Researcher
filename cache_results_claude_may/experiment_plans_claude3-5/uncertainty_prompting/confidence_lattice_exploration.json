    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different levels of abstraction and specificity in their responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often focus on single-level confidence estimation or use simple aggregation methods across multiple samples.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring a lattice of increasingly specific assertions, we can better capture the nuanced uncertainties in LLM responses and identify the exact point where confidence begins to waver.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Lattice Exploration (CLE), a multi-step prompting technique that constructs a hierarchical lattice of assertions. Starting with a broad claim, we iteratively prompt the LLM to generate more specific sub-claims and estimate confidence for each. The process continues until reaching atomic facts or a confidence threshold. We then aggregate confidences using a novel bottom-up propagation algorithm that accounts for logical dependencies between levels. Prompts are carefully designed to elicit both the sub-claims and associated confidences at each step.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CLE against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on tasks requiring multi-level reasoning, such as scientific claim verification and complex question-answering. Measure performance using calibration metrics and a new metric for hierarchical confidence assessment."

        "Title": "Confidence Lattice Exploration: Hierarchical Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different levels of abstraction and specificity in their responses. This limitation hinders their reliability and interpretability in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches often focus on single-level confidence estimation or use simple aggregation methods across multiple samples. These methods fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties that arise when LLMs reason across different levels of abstraction. By exploring a lattice of increasingly specific assertions, we can better capture the nuanced uncertainties in LLM responses and identify the exact point where confidence begins to waver. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems and assess our confidence at each step.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Lattice Exploration (CLE), a multi-step prompting technique that constructs a hierarchical lattice of assertions. Starting with a broad claim, we iteratively prompt the LLM to generate more specific sub-claims and estimate confidence for each. The process continues until reaching atomic facts or a confidence threshold. We then aggregate confidences using a novel bottom-up propagation algorithm that accounts for logical dependencies between levels. Prompts are carefully designed to elicit both the sub-claims and associated confidences at each step.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: (1) Scientific claim verification dataset (e.g., SciFact), (2) Multi-hop question answering dataset (e.g., HotpotQA), and (3) Complex reasoning dataset (e.g., StrategyQA). These datasets cover a range of tasks requiring multi-level reasoning and uncertainty quantification.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: simply ask the LLM to provide a confidence score for its answer. (2) Ensemble method: generate multiple responses and use their agreement as a proxy for confidence. (3) Monte Carlo Dropout: if using an open-source LLM, apply MC dropout during inference to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CLE Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Lattice Exploration method: (a) Design prompts for generating sub-claims and confidence estimates. (b) Implement the iterative process of generating the lattice. (c) Develop the bottom-up confidence propagation algorithm.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design effective prompts for each step of CLE: (1) Initial broad claim generation, (2) Sub-claim generation, (3) Confidence estimation for each claim. Example prompt for sub-claim generation: 'Given the claim \"{claim}\", generate 2-3 more specific sub-claims that together support or explain this claim. For each sub-claim, also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. If computational resources allow, we will also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CLE against baselines using the following metrics: (1) Calibration error: measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. (2) Hierarchical Confidence Assessment (HCA) score: a new metric we'll develop to assess the consistency and accuracy of confidence estimates across the lattice levels. (3) Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., F1 score for QA tasks).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: (1) Compare CLE performance against baselines across different tasks and models. (2) Analyze the structure of generated lattices and how confidence propagates through them. (3) Investigate cases where CLE significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines to understand its strengths and limitations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who invented the telephone? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Confidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLE; Step 1: Initial Claim)": "Q: Who invented the telephone? Provide an initial broad claim as an answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLE; Step 1: Initial Claim)": "Alexander Graham Bell is credited with inventing the telephone in the 1870s.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLE; Step 2: Sub-claims)": "Given the claim \"Alexander Graham Bell is credited with inventing the telephone in the 1870s\", generate 2-3 more specific sub-claims that together support or explain this claim. For each sub-claim, also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLE; Step 2: Sub-claims)": "1. Bell patented the first practical telephone in 1876. (Confidence: 0.98)\n2. Bell's invention was based on his work with sound and speech transmission. (Confidence: 0.95)\n3. There were other inventors working on similar technologies at the time, but Bell was first to patent. (Confidence: 0.85)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLE; Step 3: Further Sub-claims)": "For the sub-claim \"Bell patented the first practical telephone in 1876\", generate 2-3 more specific sub-claims. For each sub-claim, also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLE; Step 3: Further Sub-claims)": "1. Bell's patent, No. 174,465, was issued on March 7, 1876. (Confidence: 0.99)\n2. Bell's patent application was filed just hours before a similar one by Elisha Gray. (Confidence: 0.90)\n3. Bell's patent described the method of transmitting vocal sounds telegraphically. (Confidence: 0.95)",
            "explanation": "CLE allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's knowledge and uncertainty. It reveals areas where the model is very confident (e.g., the specific patent details) and areas where it's less certain (e.g., the competition with other inventors). This hierarchical approach provides a richer understanding of the model's confidence across different levels of specificity, which is not captured by the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CLE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated lattices to understand why the method isn't improving performance. This could reveal interesting insights about how LLMs structure knowledge and reason about uncertainty. (2) Explore variations of the CLE method, such as different lattice structures or alternative confidence propagation algorithms. (3) Investigate how the performance of CLE varies across different types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when hierarchical uncertainty quantification is most beneficial. (4) Combine CLE with other techniques like chain-of-thought prompting or retrieval-augmented generation to see if there are synergistic effects. (5) If the lattice generation is high-quality but confidence estimation is poor, we could focus on improving the confidence calibration aspect, potentially incorporating external calibration methods."
