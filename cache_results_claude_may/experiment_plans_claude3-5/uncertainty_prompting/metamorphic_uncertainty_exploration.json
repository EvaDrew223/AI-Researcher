    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often struggle to maintain consistent levels of expressed uncertainty when faced with semantically equivalent but syntactically different inputs, leading to unreliable confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-prompt uncertainty estimation, neglecting the potential insights gained from exploring variations of the same query.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring semantically equivalent variations of a query, we can obtain a more robust estimate of the model's true uncertainty and identify inconsistencies in confidence expression.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Uncertainty Exploration (MUE), a prompting technique that leverages the principles of metamorphic testing. The method involves: 1) Generating multiple semantically equivalent variations of the input query using paraphrasing techniques. 2) Prompting the model with each variation and collecting confidence estimates. 3) Analyzing the distribution of confidence scores across variations to identify inconsistencies. 4) Constructing a meta-prompt that highlights these inconsistencies and asks the model to reconcile them, e.g., 'You expressed [high/low] confidence for [original query] but [low/high] confidence for the equivalent query [paraphrased version]. Please explain this discrepancy and provide a revised confidence estimate.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MUE with standard single-prompt methods on tasks such as fact-checking, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference. Evaluate using metrics like consistency of confidence estimates across variations, calibration improvement after reconciliation, and correlation with human judgments of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Metamorphic Uncertainty Exploration: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Language models often struggle to maintain consistent levels of expressed uncertainty when faced with semantically equivalent but syntactically different inputs, leading to unreliable confidence estimates. This inconsistency hinders the models' ability to accurately convey their level of certainty, which is crucial for many real-world applications where understanding the model's confidence is as important as the prediction itself.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on single-prompt uncertainty estimation, neglecting the potential insights gained from exploring variations of the same query. By systematically exploring semantically equivalent variations of a query, we can obtain a more robust estimate of the model's true uncertainty and identify inconsistencies in confidence expression. This approach is inspired by metamorphic testing in software engineering, where input relations are used to detect inconsistencies in program behavior. In our case, we leverage the principle that semantically equivalent inputs should yield consistent confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Uncertainty Exploration (MUE), a prompting technique that leverages the principles of metamorphic testing. The method involves: 1) Generating multiple semantically equivalent variations of the input query using paraphrasing techniques. 2) Prompting the model with each variation and collecting confidence estimates. 3) Analyzing the distribution of confidence scores across variations to identify inconsistencies. 4) Constructing a meta-prompt that highlights these inconsistencies and asks the model to reconcile them, e.g., 'You expressed [high/low] confidence for [original query] but [low/high] confidence for the equivalent query [paraphrased version]. Please explain this discrepancy and provide a revised confidence estimate.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for our experiments: 1) FEVER for fact-checking, 2) Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) for sentiment analysis, and 3) SNLI for natural language inference. These datasets cover a range of tasks where confidence calibration is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Paraphrase Generation": "For each input in the datasets, generate 5 paraphrased versions using a pre-trained paraphrasing model (e.g., T5 fine-tuned on ParaNMT). Ensure that the paraphrases maintain the original meaning.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Confidence Collection": "Prompt the target LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) with each original input and its paraphrases individually. Ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100%). Store these results.",
            "Step 4: Inconsistency Detection": "For each set of paraphrases, calculate the standard deviation of confidence scores. Flag sets with high standard deviation (e.g., > 15%) as inconsistent.",
            "Step 5: Meta-prompt Construction": "For inconsistent sets, construct a meta-prompt that presents the original query, two paraphrases with the most divergent confidence scores, and ask the model to explain the discrepancy and provide a revised confidence estimate.",
            "Step 6: Meta-prompt Execution": "Run the meta-prompts through the LLM and collect the explanations and revised confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of the baseline method (single-prompt) with MUE on the following metrics: 1) Consistency: average standard deviation of confidence scores across paraphrases. 2) Calibration: expected calibration error (ECE) and maximum calibration error (MCE). 3) Correlation with human judgments: collect human ratings of uncertainty for a subset of examples and compute Spearman correlation with model confidence.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the explanations provided by the model in the meta-prompt stage. Categorize common types of reasoning used to reconcile discrepancies. Investigate whether certain types of queries or paraphrases are more prone to inconsistencies."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Is the following statement true or false? The Eiffel Tower is located in London. Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: False\nConfidence: 95%\nExplanation: The Eiffel Tower is not located in London. It is located in Paris, France. I am highly confident in this answer as it is a well-known fact.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Paraphrase)": "Q1: Is it accurate to say that the Eiffel Tower can be found in London? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).\nQ2: Does the city of London house the famous Eiffel Tower? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Paraphrase)": "Q1 Answer: False\nQ1 Confidence: 90%\nQ1 Explanation: The Eiffel Tower is not located in London. It is a famous landmark in Paris, France.\n\nQ2 Answer: False\nQ2 Confidence: 75%\nQ2 Explanation: The Eiffel Tower is not housed in London. It is situated in Paris, France, although I'm not as certain about this as I was in the previous question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Meta-prompt)": "You provided different confidence levels for semantically equivalent questions:\nQ1: Is it accurate to say that the Eiffel Tower can be found in London? (Confidence: 90%)\nQ2: Does the city of London house the famous Eiffel Tower? (Confidence: 75%)\nPlease explain this discrepancy and provide a revised confidence estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Meta-prompt)": "Explanation of discrepancy: I apologize for the inconsistency in my confidence levels. Upon reflection, I realize that both questions are asking the same thing, and my knowledge about the location of the Eiffel Tower hasn't changed. The variation in confidence likely stemmed from the different phrasings momentarily affecting my certainty, which shouldn't have happened.\n\nRevised confidence estimate: 95%\n\nJustification: The Eiffel Tower is definitively located in Paris, France, not in London. This is a well-known fact that I'm very confident about. The 95% confidence reflects my high certainty while allowing for a small margin of error, as it's generally advisable not to claim 100% confidence in most cases.",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how MUE can identify inconsistencies in confidence estimates across paraphrases and prompt the model to reconcile these differences, leading to a more reliable and consistent confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUE method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the types of queries and paraphrases that lead to the most inconsistent confidence estimates. This could provide insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in uncertainty estimation. 2) Investigate whether the explanations generated during the meta-prompt stage contain useful information about the model's reasoning process, even if they don't lead to better calibration. This could turn the project into an analysis of LLM self-reflection capabilities. 3) Explore whether combining MUE with other calibration techniques (e.g., temperature scaling or ensemble methods) yields better results than either approach alone. 4) If the paraphrasing approach doesn't work well, we could try other metamorphic relations, such as negating the question or changing the subject while keeping the predicate the same. This would allow us to test different aspects of the model's uncertainty estimation capabilities."
