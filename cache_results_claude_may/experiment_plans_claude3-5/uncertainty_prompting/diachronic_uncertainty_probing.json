        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit inconsistent confidence levels when queried about events or concepts from different time periods, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates for temporal-sensitive tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically treat temporal aspects implicitly or rely on static knowledge cutoffs, failing to capture the dynamic nature of model uncertainty across time.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by diachronic linguistics, which studies language change over time, we propose that probing an LLM's uncertainty across different time periods can reveal more accurate and nuanced confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Diachronic Uncertainty Probing (DUP), a prompting technique that systematically queries the model about a given topic across multiple time periods to construct a temporal uncertainty profile. The method involves: 1) Temporal anchoring: Establish a baseline query in the present time. 2) Retrospective probing: Generate a series of prompts that shift the query backwards in time (e.g., 'How would you answer this question 10 years ago? 50 years ago? 100 years ago?'). 3) Prospective probing: Similarly, generate prompts that project the query into the future. 4) Confidence elicitation: For each temporal variant, elicit a confidence score. 5) Temporal uncertainty synthesis: Analyze the pattern of confidence scores across the timeline to derive a comprehensive uncertainty estimate that accounts for temporal variation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DUP on a curated dataset of temporally sensitive queries spanning history, science, and current events. Performance will be measured against traditional static confidence estimation methods, focusing on calibration accuracy, temporal consistency, and correlation with known historical uncertainties. We'll also assess the method's ability to identify anachronisms and future speculation in model outputs."

        "Title": "Diachronic Uncertainty Probing: Calibrating LLM Confidence Across Time",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent confidence levels when queried about events or concepts from different time periods, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates for temporal-sensitive tasks. This inconsistency hampers the models' ability to provide accurate and well-calibrated responses across various historical contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in LLMs typically treat temporal aspects implicitly or rely on static knowledge cutoffs, failing to capture the dynamic nature of model uncertainty across time. Inspired by diachronic linguistics, which studies language change over time, we propose that probing an LLM's uncertainty across different time periods can reveal more accurate and nuanced confidence estimates. This approach leverages the model's inherent understanding of temporal context to provide a more comprehensive uncertainty profile.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Diachronic Uncertainty Probing (DUP), a prompting technique that systematically queries the model about a given topic across multiple time periods to construct a temporal uncertainty profile. The method involves five key steps: 1) Temporal anchoring: Establish a baseline query in the present time. 2) Retrospective probing: Generate a series of prompts that shift the query backwards in time. 3) Prospective probing: Generate prompts that project the query into the future. 4) Confidence elicitation: For each temporal variant, elicit a confidence score. 5) Temporal uncertainty synthesis: Analyze the pattern of confidence scores across the timeline to derive a comprehensive uncertainty estimate that accounts for temporal variation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of temporally sensitive queries spanning history, science, and current events. Ensure a diverse range of topics and time periods. For each query, create a ground truth timeline of when certain information became known or relevant.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement traditional static confidence estimation methods as baselines. These should include: a) Direct confidence elicitation (e.g., 'How confident are you in this answer?') b) Probability calibration using temperature scaling c) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using multiple model runs",
            "Step 3: DUP Implementation": "Implement the Diachronic Uncertainty Probing method: a) For each query, generate temporal variants spanning past, present, and future (e.g., 'Answer this as if it's 1950', 'Answer this for the present day', 'Predict the answer for 2050') b) For each variant, prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score c) Aggregate the confidence scores into a temporal uncertainty profile",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, use open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of DUP against baselines using the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare predicted confidence with actual accuracy across time periods b) Temporal consistency: Measure how well the uncertainty profile aligns with known historical uncertainties c) Anachronism detection: Assess the method's ability to identify temporally inconsistent information d) Correlation with ground truth: Compare the temporal uncertainty profile with the ground truth timeline",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: a) Compare DUP performance across different types of queries (e.g., historical events vs. scientific discoveries) b) Analyze how the temporal uncertainty profile changes for different types of information c) Investigate cases where DUP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of DUP: a) Vary the number and distribution of temporal probe points b) Compare different methods of aggregating the temporal confidence scores c) Evaluate the impact of different prompting strategies for eliciting confidence"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How confident are you in your answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUP; Step 1: Temporal Anchoring)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Answer this question as if it's the present day and provide your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUP; Step 1: Temporal Anchoring)": "A: As of the present day, the first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUP; Step 2: Retrospective Probing)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Answer this question as if it's 1965 and provide your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUP; Step 2: Retrospective Probing)": "A: As of 1965, no one has yet walked on the moon. The space race between the United States and the Soviet Union is ongoing, and both countries are working towards achieving this goal. However, it's uncertain who will be the first to accomplish this feat. Confidence: 90%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUP; Step 3: Prospective Probing)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Predict the answer for the year 2100 and provide your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUP; Step 3: Prospective Probing)": "A: In 2100, the first person to walk on the moon will still be recognized as Neil Armstrong, who accomplished this feat on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission. While there may have been many more moon landings and possibly even permanent lunar bases by 2100, Armstrong's historic first step will remain unchanged. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DUP; Step 4: Confidence Elicitation)": "Based on the answers provided for different time periods, generate a confidence score (0-100%) for the overall question: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DUP; Step 4: Confidence Elicitation)": "Overall confidence score: 98%. This high confidence is based on the consistent information across different time periods, with slight uncertainty in the future prediction due to potential unforeseen developments in space exploration or historical record-keeping.",
            "Explanation": "The DUP method provides a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence across time. While the baseline method gives a flat 100% confidence, DUP reveals variations in certainty depending on the temporal context. This allows for a more accurate assessment of the model's knowledge and uncertainty, particularly for questions with temporal aspects."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DUP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of how LLMs represent and reason about temporal uncertainty. This could involve: 1) Analyzing the patterns of temporal confidence across different types of queries to understand where and why the model's uncertainty changes over time. 2) Investigating how the model's responses change when given explicit temporal context versus when it has to infer the temporal setting. 3) Exploring how different prompting strategies affect the model's expression of uncertainty, which could lead to insights on improving temporal reasoning in LLMs. 4) Conducting a comparative study across different LLMs to understand how model size and training data affect temporal uncertainty representation. These analyses could provide valuable insights into the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs and inform future research on improving their performance on time-sensitive tasks."
