        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to account for the temporal consistency of model outputs, leading to overconfident predictions in scenarios requiring reasoning over time.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on static confidence estimation or use simple ensemble methods over multiple runs.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of temporal coherence in physics and signal processing, we propose that a model's uncertainty should be informed by the consistency of its outputs over time and across slight variations in input.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Gauging (TCUG), a novel prompting technique that assesses LLM uncertainty by measuring the temporal coherence of its outputs. The method consists of four steps: 1) Temporal Expansion: Generate a series of time-shifted variants of the original query, creating a temporal sequence. 2) Coherent Response Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate responses for each time-shifted query, ensuring consistency across the temporal sequence. 3) Coherence Measurement: Compute a coherence score by analyzing the consistency and logical flow of responses across the temporal sequence. 4) Uncertainty Mapping: Map the coherence score to an uncertainty estimate using a calibrated function. Low coherence across the temporal sequence indicates high uncertainty, while high coherence suggests low uncertainty. This method captures the model's ability to maintain consistent reasoning over time, providing a more robust measure of its true uncertainty.",

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Gauging: Calibrating LLM Confidence through Time-Aware Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for the temporal consistency of model outputs, leading to overconfident predictions in scenarios requiring reasoning over time. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks that demand coherent reasoning across multiple time steps or temporal contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on static confidence estimation or use simple ensemble methods over multiple runs, which do not capture the temporal dynamics of model uncertainty. Inspired by the concept of temporal coherence in physics and signal processing, we propose that a model's uncertainty should be informed by the consistency of its outputs over time and across slight variations in input. This approach is particularly relevant for tasks that require maintaining logical consistency across a temporal sequence, such as story completion, multi-step reasoning, and time-dependent question answering.",
        "Proposed Method": "We present Temporal Coherence Uncertainty Gauging (TCUG), a novel prompting technique that assesses LLM uncertainty by measuring the temporal coherence of its outputs. The method consists of four steps: 1) Temporal Expansion: Generate a series of time-shifted variants of the original query, creating a temporal sequence. 2) Coherent Response Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate responses for each time-shifted query, ensuring consistency across the temporal sequence. 3) Coherence Measurement: Compute a coherence score by analyzing the consistency and logical flow of responses across the temporal sequence. 4) Uncertainty Mapping: Map the coherence score to an uncertainty estimate using a calibrated function. Low coherence across the temporal sequence indicates high uncertainty, while high coherence suggests low uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require temporal reasoning: 1) ROCStories for story completion, 2) CLUTRR for multi-step reasoning, and 3) TempQuestions for time-dependent question answering. For each dataset, we'll create a test set of 1000 examples.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting with temperature sampling, 2) Ensemble method with multiple runs. For each baseline, we'll use the model's output probability as the confidence score.",
            "Step 3: TCUG Implementation": "Implement the four steps of TCUG: a) Temporal Expansion: For each query, generate 5 time-shifted variants. For stories, shift events forward/backward. For reasoning tasks, introduce temporal gaps. For questions, modify time references. b) Coherent Response Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate responses for each variant, emphasizing temporal consistency. c) Coherence Measurement: Implement a coherence scoring function that evaluates consistency across the temporal sequence. d) Uncertainty Mapping: Develop a function to map coherence scores to uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run baseline methods and collect predictions and confidence scores. b) Apply TCUG method and collect predictions and uncertainty estimates. c) Repeat each experiment 5 times to ensure statistical significance.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Compare the correctness of predictions across methods. b) Calibration Error: Measure how well the confidence/uncertainty estimates align with actual performance. c) Temporal Consistency: Assess the logical coherence of responses across the temporal sequence. d) Qualitative Analysis: Manually review a subset of examples to understand the nature of improvements or failures.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze the results to compare TCUG against baselines. Investigate how TCUG performs across different types of temporal reasoning tasks. Prepare visualizations to illustrate the relationship between temporal coherence and prediction accuracy."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Complete the story: John went to the store. He bought some milk. When he got home...",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "When he got home, John realized he had forgotten to buy bread. He put the milk in the refrigerator and decided to make a sandwich with what he had available. Despite the missing bread, John managed to prepare a satisfying snack using crackers instead.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUG Step 1: Temporal Expansion)": "Generate 5 time-shifted variants of the story: John went to the store. He bought some milk. When he got home...",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUG Step 1: Temporal Expansion)": "1. Earlier that day: John made a shopping list. He noticed he was out of milk. He decided to go to the store.\n2. At the store: John walked through the aisles. He picked up a carton of milk. He headed to the checkout.\n3. On the way home: John carried his grocery bag. The milk carton felt cold in his hand. He walked briskly.\n4. Arriving home: John reached his front door. He fumbled for his keys. He entered his house with the milk.\n5. Later that evening: John opened the refrigerator. He saw the milk he had bought earlier. He poured himself a glass.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUG Step 2: Coherent Response Generation)": "Complete each of the following story segments, ensuring consistency across the temporal sequence: [Include the 5 time-shifted variants]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUG Step 2: Coherent Response Generation)": "1. Earlier that day: John made a shopping list. He noticed he was out of milk. He decided to go to the store. John grabbed his wallet and keys, determined to get the milk he needed for his morning coffee tomorrow.\n2. At the store: John walked through the aisles. He picked up a carton of milk. He headed to the checkout. As he waited in line, John remembered he also needed bread, but decided to stick to his original plan of just buying milk.\n3. On the way home: John carried his grocery bag. The milk carton felt cold in his hand. He walked briskly. He thought about how he'd have to come back tomorrow for the bread he forgot.\n4. Arriving home: John reached his front door. He fumbled for his keys. He entered his house with the milk. He went straight to the kitchen, looking forward to putting the milk in the refrigerator.\n5. Later that evening: John opened the refrigerator. He saw the milk he had bought earlier. He poured himself a glass. As he sipped the cold milk, he made a mental note to buy bread first thing in the morning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUG Step 3: Coherence Measurement)": "Analyze the coherence of the following story segments: [Include the completed story segments]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUG Step 3: Coherence Measurement)": "Coherence Score: 0.92\nJustification: The story segments maintain high temporal coherence. Key elements (milk, forgetting bread) are consistently referenced across all time points. The character's actions and thoughts logically progress from making a shopping list to enjoying the purchased milk. The only minor inconsistency is the absence of mentioning the forgotten bread in segment 4, slightly reducing the perfect coherence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCUG Step 4: Uncertainty Mapping)": "Based on the coherence score of 0.92, estimate the uncertainty of the model's prediction for the original story completion task.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCUG Step 4: Uncertainty Mapping)": "Uncertainty Estimate: 0.08\nJustification: Given the high coherence score of 0.92, we can infer that the model's predictions are highly consistent across the temporal sequence. This suggests a low uncertainty in the model's ability to complete the original story. The uncertainty estimate of 0.08 (1 - 0.92) reflects the high confidence in the model's prediction while accounting for the small degree of inconsistency observed.",
            "Explanation": "The TCUG method provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by considering the temporal coherence of the model's outputs across multiple time points. This approach captures the model's ability to maintain consistent reasoning over time, which is crucial for tasks requiring temporal understanding. In contrast, baseline methods might provide overconfident estimates based solely on the model's output probability for a single completion, without considering its temporal consistency."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCUG method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a detailed analysis to understand the limitations. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and diversity of generated temporal variants to ensure they adequately capture different temporal aspects of the task. 2) Analyzing the coherence measurement function to verify if it accurately reflects temporal consistency. 3) Investigating whether certain types of temporal reasoning tasks benefit more from TCUG than others. Based on these analyses, we could refine the TCUG method, for example, by developing task-specific temporal expansion strategies or more sophisticated coherence measurement techniques. Additionally, we could explore combining TCUG with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies. If improvements remain limited, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of how different types of language models handle temporal reasoning tasks, providing insights into the temporal reasoning capabilities and limitations of current LLMs."
