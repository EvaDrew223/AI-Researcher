    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to capture the full spectrum of possible interpretations and confidence levels for a given input.",
        "Existing Methods": "Traditional approaches like ensemble methods or dropout-based uncertainty estimation provide limited insight into the model's internal uncertainty landscape.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by quantum mechanics, we can conceptualize LLM responses as existing in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for a richer representation of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Confidence Prompting (QSCP), which involves prompting the LLM to generate multiple parallel responses, each with an associated confidence level. The prompt instructs the model to imagine it exists in multiple 'quantum states' simultaneously, each offering a different interpretation or answer. For example: 'Imagine you are in 5 parallel universes. In each universe, provide a different answer to the question along with your confidence level (0-100%) for that answer.' This approach allows for capturing a diverse set of responses and their associated confidences, providing a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare QSCP against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble techniques on various question-answering and reasoning tasks. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and a novel 'quantum uncertainty score' that measures the diversity and distribution of confidence across the generated responses."

        "Title": "Quantum Superposition Confidence Prompting: A Novel Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the full spectrum of possible interpretations and confidence levels for a given input. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs, especially in critical applications where understanding the model's uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Traditional approaches like ensemble methods or dropout-based uncertainty estimation provide limited insight into the model's internal uncertainty landscape. Inspired by quantum mechanics, we conceptualize LLM responses as existing in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for a richer representation of uncertainty. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to generate diverse responses and self-assess confidence, potentially offering a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Confidence Prompting (QSCP), which involves prompting the LLM to generate multiple parallel responses, each with an associated confidence level. The prompt instructs the model to imagine it exists in multiple 'quantum states' simultaneously, each offering a different interpretation or answer.

This approach allows for capturing a diverse set of responses and their associated confidences, providing a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets that cover various domains and types of questions. We will use: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) AmbigQA for ambiguous questions, and 3) MMLU for multi-domain knowledge evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Ask the model to provide a single answer with a confidence score. b) Ensemble technique: Use multiple forward passes with different random seeds and aggregate the results. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and perform multiple forward passes.",
            "Step 3: QSCP Implementation": "Develop the QSCP prompt template: 'Imagine you are in N parallel universes. In each universe, provide a different answer to the following question along with your confidence level (0-100%) for that answer. Question: [INSERT QUESTION]' We will experiment with N = 3, 5, and 7.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and each method (baselines and QSCP), generate responses for all questions. For QSCP, collect N different answers and their associated confidence levels for each question.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence with its actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Quantum Uncertainty Score (QUS): A novel metric that measures the diversity and distribution of confidence across the generated responses. Calculate as the entropy of the confidence distribution normalized by log(N).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare QSCP against baseline methods using the implemented metrics. Analyze how the number of 'parallel universes' (N) affects the results. Examine cases where QSCP outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the prompt wording (e.g., 'parallel worlds' instead of 'universes') and the confidence scale (e.g., 1-10 instead of 0-100%) to assess the robustness of QSCP."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%) in your response.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon. Confidence: 95%",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Ensemble Technique)": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the moon?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Ensemble Technique)": "[After multiple runs] A: Neil Armstrong (4 times), Buzz Aldrin (1 time). Confidence: 80% (4/5 agreement)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (QSCP)": "Imagine you are in 5 parallel universes. In each universe, provide a different answer to the following question along with your confidence level (0-100%) for that answer. Question: Who was the first person to step on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (QSCP)": "Universe 1: Neil Armstrong (Confidence: 95%)\nUniverse 2: Buzz Aldrin (Confidence: 20%)\nUniverse 3: Neil Armstrong (Confidence: 98%)\nUniverse 4: Yuri Gagarin (Confidence: 5%)\nUniverse 5: Neil Armstrong (Confidence: 97%)",
            "Explanation": "QSCP provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty. It captures the correct answer (Neil Armstrong) with high confidence in multiple 'universes', but also shows awareness of potential alternatives (Buzz Aldrin, who was the second person on the moon) and even incorrect answers (Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space) with appropriately low confidence. This richer representation allows for better uncertainty quantification compared to the baselines."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If QSCP doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the patterns in the generated 'quantum' responses to gain insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases. This could lead to a paper on the internal workings of LLMs when forced to generate diverse responses. Second, we could explore combining QSCP with other techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting, to see if this hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could investigate whether QSCP is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, potentially leading to a targeted application of the method in specific areas where it shows the most promise."
