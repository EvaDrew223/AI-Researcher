    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often fail to account for the temporal nature of knowledge and the uncertainty that arises from potential future changes or discoveries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current uncertainty quantification methods typically focus on present knowledge states without considering how certainty might change over time.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to consider potential future developments and how they might affect current knowledge, we can obtain a more comprehensive and forward-looking uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Quantification (TDUQ), a prompting technique that explicitly incorporates the temporal dimension into uncertainty estimation. TDUQ first elicits a standard response to a query, then prompts the model to generate hypothetical future scenarios at various time points (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 20 years from now). For each time point, the model is asked to consider potential discoveries, technological advancements, or paradigm shifts that could affect the certainty of the original answer. The model then re-evaluates its original response in light of these hypothetical futures, adjusting its certainty estimates accordingly. TDUQ aggregates these temporal projections to create a 'temporal uncertainty profile' that shows how the model's certainty might evolve over time. This profile captures both immediate uncertainty and the potential for future uncertainty due to anticipated changes in knowledge or context.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TDUQ on a range of questions in rapidly evolving fields such as technology, medicine, and climate science. Performance will be compared against standard uncertainty estimation techniques that do not consider temporal factors. We will also conduct a longitudinal study, revisiting questions after actual time has passed to assess the accuracy of the temporal uncertainty profiles."

        "Title": "Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Quantification: Calibrating LLM Confidence Through Time-Aware Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often fail to account for the temporal nature of knowledge and the uncertainty that arises from potential future changes or discoveries. This leads to overconfident predictions and a lack of nuance in their uncertainty estimates, particularly for topics that are rapidly evolving or subject to future developments.",
        "Motivation": "Current uncertainty quantification methods typically focus on present knowledge states without considering how certainty might change over time. By prompting the model to consider potential future developments and how they might affect current knowledge, we can obtain a more comprehensive and forward-looking uncertainty estimate. This approach is inspired by human expert reasoning, where confidence in predictions often varies based on anticipated future changes in the field.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Quantification (TDUQ), a prompting technique that explicitly incorporates the temporal dimension into uncertainty estimation. TDUQ consists of the following steps:\n1. Elicit a standard response to a query, along with a confidence score.\n2. Prompt the model to generate hypothetical future scenarios at various time points (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 20 years from now).\n3. For each time point, ask the model to consider potential discoveries, technological advancements, or paradigm shifts that could affect the certainty of the original answer.\n4. Prompt the model to re-evaluate its original response in light of these hypothetical futures, adjusting its certainty estimates accordingly.\n5. Aggregate these temporal projections to create a 'temporal uncertainty profile' that shows how the model's certainty might evolve over time.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of questions from rapidly evolving fields such as technology, medicine, and climate science. Ensure a mix of questions that are likely to have varying degrees of temporal uncertainty. For each question, include a ground truth answer and, if possible, expert-provided uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation techniques as baselines:\na) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score.\nb) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use multiple model runs or different model versions to estimate uncertainty.\nc) Calibrated confidence estimation: Apply post-hoc calibration techniques to the model's confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: TDUQ Implementation": "Implement the TDUQ method with the following prompts:\na) Initial response: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'\nb) Future scenario generation: 'Imagine potential developments in 1 year, 5 years, and 20 years that could affect the answer to this question: [QUESTION]'\nc) Re-evaluation: 'Given these potential future developments, re-evaluate your answer and confidence score for the original question: [QUESTION]'\nd) Aggregate the confidence scores across time points to create the temporal uncertainty profile.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. If possible, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of TDUQ against the baselines using the following metrics:\na) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence scores with actual accuracy.\nb) Sharpness: Measure the specificity of the uncertainty estimates.\nc) Temporal consistency: Assess how well the uncertainty profiles align with expert judgments on how certainty should change over time.\nd) Longitudinal accuracy: For a subset of questions, track actual developments over time and compare them with the model's projected uncertainty profiles.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results:\na) Compare TDUQ performance across different domains and time horizons.\nb) Analyze cases where TDUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\nc) Examine the quality and relevance of generated future scenarios.\nd) Investigate how different aggregation methods for creating the temporal uncertainty profile affect performance."

The breakthroughs in perovskite solar cells and advancements in energy storage could further boost solar energy's dominance. However, major investments in offshore wind farms and potential policy shifts towards green hydrogen production introduce more competition. The longer-term developments like fusion energy and space-based solar power are unlikely to significantly impact the 2030 timeframe but add to the overall uncertainty.\n\nRevised confidence score: 65",
            "Explanation": "The TDUQ method provides a more nuanced and time-aware uncertainty estimate. By considering potential future developments, the model reduces its confidence and provides a more detailed explanation of the factors that could influence the outcome. This approach captures the temporal nature of uncertainty in a way that the baseline method does not."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TDUQ method does not show significant improvements over the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the generated future scenarios to understand the model's ability to predict plausible developments. This could lead to insights about the model's knowledge representation and temporal reasoning capabilities.\n2. Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from TDUQ than others. This could inform a more targeted application of the method.\n3. Explore different ways of aggregating the temporal uncertainty profiles, such as weighting recent time points more heavily or using non-linear combinations of confidence scores.\n4. Combine TDUQ with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods.\n5. Conduct a qualitative analysis of how TDUQ affects the model's reasoning process, potentially revealing insights about how temporal considerations influence language model outputs.\n6. If the method shows promise but lacks quantitative improvements, focus on developing better evaluation metrics that capture the nuanced aspects of temporal uncertainty."
