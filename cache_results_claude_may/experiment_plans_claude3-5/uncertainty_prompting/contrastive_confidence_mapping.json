        "Problem": "LLMs struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across diverse tasks and domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on task-specific fine-tuning or external calibration models, limiting their generalizability.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often assess their confidence by comparing their knowledge across different domains. We can adapt this contrastive approach to improve LLM calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Mapping (CCM), a prompting technique that leverages cross-domain comparisons to calibrate confidence. For a given query, we prompt the model to compare its knowledge to a series of benchmark tasks across various domains, ranging from common knowledge to specialized fields. The model must rate its relative confidence between the original query and each benchmark task. These comparisons are then aggregated into a calibrated confidence score. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to introspect on its knowledge breadth and depth.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCM against standard confidence elicitation on a diverse set of tasks spanning multiple domains. Assess calibration quality and performance consistency across different types of queries."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Mapping: Improving LLM Calibration through Cross-Domain Comparisons",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across diverse tasks and domains, leading to overconfident predictions on unfamiliar topics or underconfident responses in areas of expertise.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning or external calibration models, which limits their generalizability. Inspired by human metacognition, where individuals assess their confidence by comparing knowledge across different domains, we propose a novel prompting technique that leverages cross-domain comparisons to improve LLM calibration without the need for task-specific training or external models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Mapping (CCM), a prompting technique that calibrates LLM confidence through cross-domain comparisons. For a given query, CCM prompts the model to compare its knowledge to a series of benchmark tasks across various domains, ranging from common knowledge to specialized fields. The model must rate its relative confidence between the original query and each benchmark task. These comparisons are then aggregated into a calibrated confidence score. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to introspect on its knowledge breadth and depth, leading to more accurate confidence estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Prepare Benchmark Tasks": "Create a diverse set of benchmark tasks spanning multiple domains (e.g., general knowledge, science, history, current events, specialized fields). Each benchmark task should have a known difficulty level and domain classification.",
            "Step 2: Develop CCM Prompts": "Design prompts that instruct the LLM to compare its confidence on the target query to each benchmark task. Example prompt structure: 'Compare your confidence in answering the following question: [TARGET QUERY] to your confidence in answering this benchmark question: [BENCHMARK TASK]. Rate your relative confidence on a scale from -5 (much less confident in target query) to +5 (much more confident in target query).'",
            "Step 3: Implement Confidence Aggregation": "Develop a method to aggregate the relative confidence ratings into a final calibrated confidence score. This could involve weighted averaging based on benchmark task difficulty or domain relevance.",
            "Step 4: Select Evaluation Datasets": "Choose diverse datasets that cover multiple domains and difficulty levels. Suggested datasets: TriviaQA, SQuAD 2.0, MMLU, and ARC-Challenge.",
            "Step 5: Baseline Methods": "Implement standard confidence elicitation methods for comparison: (1) Direct prompting: 'Answer the following question and rate your confidence from 0-100%', (2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings and convert logits to confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Select LLMs": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for primary experiments. If resources allow, include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM from Google for broader comparison.",
            "Step 7: Run Experiments": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Generate answers and confidence scores using baseline methods, (b) Apply CCM to generate calibrated confidence scores, (c) Record model outputs, confidence scores, and ground truth answers.",
            "Step 8: Evaluate Calibration": "Assess calibration quality using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. Compare CCM results against baseline methods.",
            "Step 9: Analyze Performance": "Examine how CCM performs across different domains, difficulty levels, and query types. Identify areas where CCM shows the most improvement and potential limitations.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: (a) Vary the number and selection of benchmark tasks, (b) Experiment with different aggregation methods for confidence scores, (c) Test the effect of providing domain information in the prompt."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Rate your confidence in your answer from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Compare your confidence in answering this question to the following benchmark tasks:\n1. What is 2+2?\n2. Who was the 3rd President of the United States?\n3. What is the chemical formula for glucose?\n4. Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022?\nRate your relative confidence for each comparison on a scale from -5 to +5.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Comparisons:\n1. 2+2: -1 (Slightly less confident than this basic math question)\n2. 3rd US President: +2 (More confident than this specific history question)\n3. Glucose formula: +3 (Significantly more confident than this chemistry question)\n4. 2022 Nobel Physics: +4 (Much more confident than this recent specialized knowledge)\n\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\nCalibrated Confidence: 92% (Based on the pattern of comparisons, showing high but not absolute confidence)",
            "Explanation": "CCM provides a more nuanced confidence assessment by leveraging comparisons across domains. The model demonstrates high confidence but acknowledges there are some questions it's even more certain about (like 2+2), leading to a slightly lower but potentially more accurate confidence score compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCM does not significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Analyze the generated comparisons to gain insights into the model's self-assessment across domains. This could lead to a paper on LLM metacognition patterns. (2) Investigate whether CCM improves performance on specific subsets of queries or domains, which could inform more targeted calibration strategies. (3) Explore using CCM as a data generation technique for training external calibration models, potentially combining the benefits of prompting and fine-tuning approaches. (4) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why CCM may not be effective, which could reveal important limitations of current LLMs in self-assessment and guide future research in this area."
