        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often fail to capture the model's robustness to slight changes in input conditions, leading to overconfident predictions on unstable knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include dropout-based uncertainty, ensemble methods, and direct confidence elicitation.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by causal inference and robustness testing in machine learning, we propose that a model's certainty should be reflected in its consistency across counterfactual scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Consistency Analysis for Uncertainty Quantification (CCAUQ). For a given query, we generate a set of counterfactual scenarios by systematically varying key elements of the input (e.g., entities, relations, contextual factors). We then prompt the LLM to answer the original query and its counterfactual variants. Uncertainty is estimated based on the consistency of the model's responses across these scenarios. High consistency indicates low uncertainty, while significant variations in responses suggest high uncertainty. We also analyze the patterns of inconsistencies to provide structured uncertainty information, identifying specific aspects of the query that contribute most to the model's uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCAUQ against standard uncertainty quantification methods on tasks such as factual question answering, causal reasoning, and prediction tasks. Measure performance using calibration error, sharpness, and correlation with human judgments of uncertainty. Additionally, assess the method's ability to identify specific sources of uncertainty in the model's knowledge."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Consistency Analysis for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the model's robustness to slight changes in input conditions, leading to overconfident predictions on unstable knowledge. This problem is particularly critical in high-stakes applications where understanding the model's confidence is crucial for decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs, such as dropout-based uncertainty, ensemble methods, and direct confidence elicitation, do not adequately capture the model's sensitivity to input variations. Inspired by causal inference and robustness testing in machine learning, we propose that a model's certainty should be reflected in its consistency across counterfactual scenarios. This approach aligns with the intuition that truly confident predictions should remain stable under small perturbations of the input.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Consistency Analysis for Uncertainty Quantification (CCAUQ). For a given query, we generate a set of counterfactual scenarios by systematically varying key elements of the input (e.g., entities, relations, contextual factors). We then prompt the LLM to answer the original query and its counterfactual variants. Uncertainty is estimated based on the consistency of the model's responses across these scenarios. High consistency indicates low uncertainty, while significant variations in responses suggest high uncertainty. We also analyze the patterns of inconsistencies to provide structured uncertainty information, identifying specific aspects of the query that contribute most to the model's uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for evaluation: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) COPA for causal reasoning. These datasets cover a range of reasoning tasks where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation methods: (1) Softmax probability as confidence, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (3) Ensemble of 5 different model checkpoints or API calls.",
            "Step 3: CCAUQ Implementation": "Implement the CCAUQ method with the following sub-steps: (a) Counterfactual generation: For each query, generate 5 counterfactual variants by replacing key entities, modifying relations, or altering contextual information. (b) Response generation: Use the LLM to generate responses for the original query and all counterfactual variants. (c) Consistency analysis: Compute a consistency score based on the similarity of responses across counterfactuals. (d) Uncertainty estimation: Map the consistency score to an uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of CCAUQ: (a) Counterfactual generation prompt: \"Generate 5 variations of the following question by changing key entities, relations, or context: [QUESTION]\". (b) Response generation prompt: \"Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]\". (c) Consistency analysis prompt: \"On a scale of 1-5, how consistent are the following answers? [ANSWERS] Explain your reasoning.\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B model as a comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: (1) Calibration error: measure how well the uncertainty estimates align with actual error rates. (2) Sharpness: assess the concentration of uncertainty estimates. (3) Correlation with human judgments: compare model uncertainty with human-rated confidence on a subset of 100 examples per dataset.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3 expert annotators to rate the confidence of model answers on a scale of 1-5 for 100 randomly selected examples from each dataset. Use these ratings to compute correlation with model uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: (1) Compare CCAUQ performance against baselines across all metrics. (2) Analyze patterns of inconsistencies to identify common sources of uncertainty. (3) Investigate the relationship between input complexity and uncertainty estimates. (4) Examine how uncertainty estimates vary across different types of reasoning tasks."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Output (Softmax Probability)": "Answer: Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method simply uses the softmax probability as a confidence score, which can be overconfident even when the model's knowledge is uncertain or incorrect."
            },
            "CCAUQ Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
                "Counterfactual Generation": "1. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the first person to orbit the moon?\n3. Who was the first American to walk in space?\n4. Who was the first woman to walk on the moon?\n5. Who was the last person to walk on the moon?",
                "Response Generation": "Original: Neil Armstrong\n1. Buzz Aldrin\n2. Frank Borman\n3. Ed White\n4. No woman has walked on the moon yet\n5. Eugene Cernan",
                "Consistency Analysis": "Consistency Score: 4/5. The model shows high consistency in moon-related knowledge, but some uncertainty about specific roles and achievements.",
                "Output": "Answer: Neil Armstrong. Uncertainty: Low (0.2)",
                "Explanation": "CCAUQ generates counterfactuals to test the model's consistency. The high consistency across related questions suggests low uncertainty, but the method captures nuanced uncertainty about specific space exploration facts."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCAUQ does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: (1) Analyzing the quality and relevance of generated counterfactuals to ensure they are testing the right aspects of knowledge. (2) Investigating whether the consistency analysis is capturing meaningful variations in model responses. (3) Exploring different ways to aggregate consistency scores across counterfactuals. We could also expand the project to compare CCAUQ with other advanced uncertainty estimation methods like calibrated ensembles or Bayesian neural networks. Additionally, we might focus on specific domains or types of questions where CCAUQ shows the most promise, turning the project into a focused analysis of when and why counterfactual consistency is most informative for uncertainty estimation in LLMs."
