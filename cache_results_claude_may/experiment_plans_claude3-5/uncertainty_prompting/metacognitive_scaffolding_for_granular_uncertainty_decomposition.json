        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often provide a single, coarse-grained confidence score, failing to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall task confidence without breaking down uncertainty into its constituent components or reasoning steps.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by metacognitive strategies in human learning and the concept of scaffolding in education, we propose a method that guides the model through a structured self-reflection process to decompose and quantify uncertainty at multiple levels of granularity.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metacognitive Scaffolding for Granular Uncertainty Decomposition (MSGUD), a multi-stage prompting technique that breaks down the uncertainty estimation process into explicit metacognitive steps. The process involves: 1) Task decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the main task into subtasks or reasoning steps. 2) Knowledge assessment: For each subtask, prompt the model to assess its relevant knowledge, identifying gaps or potential misconceptions. 3) Reasoning uncertainty: Guide the model to evaluate the uncertainty in its reasoning process for each subtask, considering factors like logical leaps or potential fallacies. 4) Evidence evaluation: Prompt the model to assess the quality and relevance of any evidence or facts it's using. 5) Confidence synthesis: Based on the previous steps, prompt the model to synthesize a structured uncertainty report, providing granular confidence scores for different aspects of the task and an overall uncertainty estimate. This method provides a detailed, interpretable breakdown of the model's uncertainty, allowing for targeted improvements or more informed decision-making based on the results.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MSGUD against standard uncertainty estimation methods on complex reasoning tasks from benchmarks like ARC and MMLU. We'll measure both overall calibration and the quality of the granular uncertainty decomposition. We'll also conduct expert evaluations to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the detailed uncertainty reports for real-world decision-making scenarios."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Scaffolding for Granular Uncertainty Decomposition in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models often provide a single, coarse-grained confidence score, failing to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation hinders our ability to understand and improve model performance, as well as to make informed decisions based on model outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall task confidence without breaking down uncertainty into its constituent components or reasoning steps. This coarse-grained approach fails to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by metacognitive strategies in human learning and the concept of scaffolding in education, we propose a method that guides the model through a structured self-reflection process to decompose and quantify uncertainty at multiple levels of granularity. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to analyze its reasoning process, potentially leading to more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from the following datasets: 1) ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) for scientific reasoning, 2) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for diverse domain knowledge, focusing on the sections requiring multi-step reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are chosen for their strong performance on complex reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with a request for confidence score, 2) Temperature scaling method where we use different temperature settings to generate multiple outputs and calculate uncertainty based on the variance of these outputs.",
            "Step 4: MSGUD Implementation": "Implement the MSGUD method with the following sub-steps for each question: a) Task decomposition prompt: 'Break down this question into 3-5 subtasks or reasoning steps.', b) Knowledge assessment prompt: 'For each subtask, rate your knowledge level from 1-10 and explain any gaps or uncertainties.', c) Reasoning uncertainty prompt: 'Evaluate your reasoning process for each subtask. Identify any logical leaps or potential fallacies.', d) Evidence evaluation prompt: 'Assess the quality and relevance of the evidence or facts you're using for each subtask.', e) Confidence synthesis prompt: 'Based on your previous analyses, provide a structured uncertainty report with granular confidence scores for different aspects and an overall uncertainty estimate.'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence scores with its actual performance, 2) Spearman rank correlation: Measure how well the model's uncertainty estimates correlate with human expert ratings, 3) Interpretability score: Have human experts rate the usefulness and clarity of the uncertainty breakdowns.",
            "Step 6: Human Expert Evaluation": "Recruit 3-5 domain experts to rate a subset of the model's uncertainty reports on a scale of 1-5 for usefulness and interpretability.",
            "Step 7: Comparative Analysis": "Compare the performance of MSGUD against the baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the granularity and interpretability of the uncertainty estimates provided by MSGUD.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing each step of the MSGUD process to understand the contribution of each component to the final performance.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Analyze cases where MSGUD performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines. Identify patterns in these cases to understand the strengths and limitations of the method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: A container ship carries 160 cars. How many container ships are needed to transport 720 cars? Please provide your answer and your confidence level from 0 to 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "To determine how many container ships are needed to transport 720 cars, we need to divide the total number of cars by the number of cars each ship can carry.\n\n720 cars \u00f7 160 cars per ship = 4.5 ships\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a ship, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 5 container ships are needed to transport 720 cars.\n\nAnswer: 5 container ships\n\nConfidence level: 0.95\n\nI'm highly confident in this answer because it involves straightforward arithmetic and logical reasoning. The only potential source of uncertainty is whether partial ships are allowed, but I addressed this by rounding up to the nearest whole number.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: A container ship carries 160 cars. How many container ships are needed to transport 720 cars?\n\nLet's approach this question step by step using the Metacognitive Scaffolding for Granular Uncertainty Decomposition (MSGUD) method:\n\n1. Task decomposition:\nBreak down this question into 3-5 subtasks or reasoning steps.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Task decomposition:\n1. Understand the given information: container ship capacity and total cars to transport.\n2. Calculate the number of ships needed using division.\n3. Determine if a fractional result is acceptable or if rounding is necessary.\n4. If rounding is needed, decide whether to round up or down.\n5. Provide the final answer as a whole number of ships.\n\nNow, let's assess each subtask:\n\n2. Knowledge assessment:\nFor each subtask, rate your knowledge level from 1-10 and explain any gaps or uncertainties.\n\n1. Understand given information: 10/10 - The information is clearly stated in the question.\n2. Calculate using division: 10/10 - This is a simple arithmetic operation.\n3. Determine if fractional result is acceptable: 8/10 - In most real-world scenarios, fractional ships aren't possible, but there might be exceptions.\n4. Decide on rounding method: 9/10 - Generally, we round up for capacity issues, but there might be specific scenarios where this isn't the case.\n5. Provide final answer: 10/10 - Once previous steps are resolved, this is straightforward.\n\n3. Reasoning uncertainty:\nEvaluate your reasoning process for each subtask. Identify any logical leaps or potential fallacies.\n\n1. No uncertainty in understanding the given information.\n2. The division calculation is straightforward with no uncertainty.\n3. Assuming fractional ships aren't possible is a potential logical leap, though it's based on real-world knowledge.\n4. Deciding to round up is based on the assumption that all cars must be transported, which might not always be explicitly stated.\n5. No uncertainty in providing the final answer once previous steps are resolved.\n\n4. Evidence evaluation:\nAssess the quality and relevance of the evidence or facts you're using for each subtask.\n\n1. The given information is directly from the question and highly relevant.\n2. The use of division is based on fundamental mathematical principles and is highly relevant.\n3. The assumption about fractional ships is based on general knowledge about shipping, which is relevant but not explicitly stated in the question.\n4. The decision to round up is based on the implicit goal of transporting all cars, which is relevant but not explicitly stated.\n5. The final answer directly addresses the question and is highly relevant.\n\n5. Confidence synthesis:\nBased on your previous analyses, provide a structured uncertainty report with granular confidence scores for different aspects and an overall uncertainty estimate.\n\nStructured Uncertainty Report:\n\n1. Understanding of given information: 100% confident\n2. Mathematical calculation: 100% confident\n3. Assumption about fractional ships: 90% confident\n4. Rounding decision: 95% confident\n5. Final answer provision: 100% confident\n\nOverall confidence: 97%\n\nThe main sources of uncertainty are the assumptions about fractional ships and the rounding decision. While these are based on real-world knowledge and logical reasoning, they aren't explicitly stated in the question. However, given the high confidence in the mathematical calculation and the understanding of the given information, the overall confidence remains high.\n\nFinal Answer: 5 container ships are needed to transport 720 cars.\n\nThis answer takes into account the need to round up from the calculated 4.5 ships to ensure all cars can be transported.",
            "explanation": "The MSGUD method provides a more detailed and nuanced uncertainty assessment compared to the baseline. It breaks down the problem into subtasks, evaluates knowledge and reasoning for each, and provides a granular confidence score. This allows for a more precise identification of sources of uncertainty, such as the assumptions about fractional ships and rounding. The baseline, while providing a single confidence score, doesn't offer insight into these specific areas of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MSGUD method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines in terms of calibration error or interpretability, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of where and why MSGUD fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in metacognitive tasks. This could involve categorizing the types of questions where MSGUD underperforms and analyzing the patterns in the model's responses. Second, we could explore variations of the MSGUD method, such as changing the order of the prompting steps or experimenting with different phrasings for each step. This could help identify which aspects of metacognitive prompting are most effective. Third, we could compare MSGUD's performance across different model sizes and architectures to understand how model capacity affects metacognitive abilities. Finally, we could shift focus to use MSGUD as a tool for analyzing model behavior rather than improving performance, using it to gain insights into how LLMs approach complex reasoning tasks and where their uncertainties lie. This could contribute to our understanding of LLM reasoning processes and inform future model development."
