    "idea_name": "Confidence Spectrum Stratification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often produce single-point estimates, failing to capture the nuanced spectrum of confidence across different aspects of a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on token-level probabilities or simple self-reported confidence scores.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express varying levels of confidence for different parts of their knowledge. Inspired by this, we aim to develop a method that allows LLMs to stratify their confidence across different components of their responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Stratification (CSS), a novel prompting technique that guides LLMs to decompose their responses into distinct confidence levels. The prompt instructs the model to categorize different parts of its answer into predefined confidence strata (e.g., 'Certain', 'Likely', 'Possible', 'Uncertain'). For instance, given a question about historical events, the prompt might be structured as: 'Provide your answer, categorizing each statement into one of the following confidence levels: [Certain], [Likely], [Possible], [Uncertain]. Begin each statement with its confidence level.' This approach encourages the model to explicitly reason about and communicate its varying degrees of certainty for different aspects of the response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CSS against baselines like direct prompting and single-point confidence estimation on tasks such as open-domain QA and fact verification. Metrics will include stratified calibration error and human evaluation of confidence alignment."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Stratification: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce single-point estimates, failing to capture the nuanced spectrum of confidence across different aspects of a response. This limitation hinders the ability to accurately assess the reliability of model outputs, particularly in complex tasks where varying degrees of certainty are crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on token-level probabilities or simple self-reported confidence scores, which do not fully capture the multifaceted nature of model uncertainty. Human experts often express varying levels of confidence for different parts of their knowledge, and we aim to replicate this nuanced approach in LLMs. By developing a method that allows LLMs to stratify their confidence across different components of their responses, we can provide users with a more granular and informative assessment of model certainty, potentially improving decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Stratification (CSS), a novel prompting technique that guides LLMs to decompose their responses into distinct confidence levels. The method involves a two-step process: 1) Confidence-stratified generation: The model is prompted to categorize different parts of its answer into predefined confidence strata (e.g., 'Certain', 'Likely', 'Possible', 'Uncertain'). 2) Calibration: We implement a calibration step to align the model's reported confidence levels with its actual performance, using a held-out validation set.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question-answering, 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with a single confidence score, 2) Token-level probability-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: CSS Prompt Design": "Design the CSS prompt template. Example: 'Provide your answer to the following question, categorizing each statement into one of these confidence levels: [Certain], [Likely], [Possible], [Uncertain]. Begin each statement with its confidence level. Question: {question}'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: CSS Implementation": "Implement the CSS method using the designed prompt template. Generate responses for all questions in the datasets.",
            "Step 6: Calibration": "Using the validation set, calculate the actual accuracy for each confidence level. Adjust the confidence levels based on this calibration.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CSS against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Stratified Calibration Error, 2) Brier Score, 3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 4) Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic curve (AUCE).",
            "Step 8: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (50 examples per dataset) to assess the alignment between model-reported confidence and human judgment of answer quality.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of CSS performance across different tasks and domains, 2) Analysis of the distribution of confidence levels for different question types, 3) Investigation of cases where CSS significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Also, provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSS)": "Provide your answer to the following question, categorizing each statement into one of these confidence levels: [Certain], [Likely], [Possible], [Uncertain]. Begin each statement with its confidence level. Question: What is the capital of France, and when was the Eiffel Tower constructed?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSS)": "[Certain] The capital of France is Paris.\n[Likely] The Eiffel Tower was constructed in the late 19th century.\n[Possible] The construction of the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.\n[Uncertain] The exact date when construction began on the Eiffel Tower.",
            "Explanation": "The CSS method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence across different aspects of the answer, allowing for a clearer understanding of which parts of the response are more reliable."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSS method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include examining the distribution of confidence levels across different question types and domains to identify any patterns or biases. We could also investigate whether the calibration step is effective or if it needs refinement. Additionally, we might explore variations of the CSS method, such as using different confidence level categories or incorporating a multi-step reasoning process before assigning confidence levels. If these approaches do not yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper, focusing on the challenges of uncertainty quantification in LLMs and providing insights into why stratified confidence reporting might be difficult for current models to achieve accurately."
