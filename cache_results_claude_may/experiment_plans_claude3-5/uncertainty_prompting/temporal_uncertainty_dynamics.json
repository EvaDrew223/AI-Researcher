        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often provide static estimates, failing to capture how uncertainty might evolve over time or with the acquisition of new information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on point-in-time uncertainty estimates, without considering the dynamic nature of knowledge and uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of temporal dynamics in physics, we propose that uncertainty in language models should be viewed as a time-dependent phenomenon, evolving as new information becomes available or as the model's internal state changes over the course of a conversation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics (TUD), a prompting technique that tracks and predicts the evolution of uncertainty over time. The process involves: (1) Initial response and uncertainty estimation. (2) Time-step prompting, where the model is asked to imagine how its uncertainty might change with the passage of time or acquisition of new information. (3) Information injection, where new (real or hypothetical) information is provided to the model. (4) Uncertainty re-estimation and comparison to the model's previous prediction. (5) Temporal pattern analysis, where the model is prompted to reflect on and explain the observed changes in uncertainty over time. This method allows for a dynamic view of uncertainty, capturing how confidence levels might fluctuate with changing conditions or knowledge states.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TUD against static uncertainty estimation methods on tasks that involve evolving information or extended reasoning chains. Develop new evaluation metrics that consider the temporal aspect of uncertainty, such as 'uncertainty stability' or 'information sensitivity' scores."

        "Title": "Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics: Quantifying Evolving Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often provide static estimates, failing to capture how uncertainty might evolve over time or with the acquisition of new information. This limitation hinders our understanding of how model confidence changes during extended reasoning processes or as new context becomes available.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on point-in-time uncertainty estimates, without considering the dynamic nature of knowledge and uncertainty. Inspired by the concept of temporal dynamics in physics, we propose that uncertainty in language models should be viewed as a time-dependent phenomenon, evolving as new information becomes available or as the model's internal state changes over the course of a conversation. This approach could provide more nuanced and accurate representations of model uncertainty, potentially improving decision-making in applications that rely on LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics (TUD), a prompting technique that tracks and predicts the evolution of uncertainty over time. The process involves five key steps: (1) Initial response and uncertainty estimation. (2) Time-step prompting, where the model is asked to imagine how its uncertainty might change with the passage of time or acquisition of new information. (3) Information injection, where new (real or hypothetical) information is provided to the model. (4) Uncertainty re-estimation and comparison to the model's previous prediction. (5) Temporal pattern analysis, where the model is prompted to reflect on and explain the observed changes in uncertainty over time.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve evolving information or extended reasoning chains: (1) Temporal-QA: a subset of TimeQA dataset focusing on time-dependent questions. (2) Multi-hop reasoning dataset: HotpotQA. (3) Long-form generation: a subset of the SummScreen dataset for TV show summarization tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: (1) Direct uncertainty estimation: Prompt the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. (2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Use multiple forward passes with dropout to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: TUD Implementation": "Implement the Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics method with the following steps for each query:\na. Initial response: Prompt the model to answer the query and provide an initial uncertainty estimate.\nb. Time-step prompting: Ask the model to predict how its uncertainty might change over time or with new information.\nc. Information injection: Provide new information or context to the model.\nd. Re-estimation: Prompt the model to provide a new answer and uncertainty estimate.\ne. Temporal analysis: Ask the model to explain the changes in its uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and TUD):\na. Process each query through the respective method.\nb. For TUD, perform 3 iterations of steps b-e.\nc. Record all intermediate outputs, uncertainty estimates, and final answers.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Develop and apply the following metrics:\na. Uncertainty Calibration Error (UCE): Measure how well the model's uncertainty estimates align with its actual performance.\nb. Temporal Consistency Score (TCS): Evaluate the consistency of uncertainty estimates across time steps.\nc. Information Sensitivity Index (ISI): Measure how much the model's uncertainty changes in response to new information.\nd. Task-specific performance metrics (e.g., F1 score for QA tasks, ROUGE for summarization).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses:\na. Compare TUD performance against baselines using the developed metrics.\nb. Analyze patterns in uncertainty evolution across different query types and datasets.\nc. Investigate correlations between uncertainty dynamics and task performance.\nd. Examine the model's explanations for changes in uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Uncertainty Estimation)": "Q: Who was the President of the United States in 2015? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Uncertainty Estimation)": "A: The President of the United States in 2015 was Barack Obama.\nConfidence Score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUD Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who was the President of the United States in 2015? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUD Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The President of the United States in 2015 was Barack Obama.\nConfidence Score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUD Step 2: Time-step Prompting)": "Imagine how your confidence in this answer might change if you were to receive new information about U.S. politics in 2015. How might your uncertainty evolve?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUD Step 2: Time-step Prompting)": "My confidence in this answer is already quite high, but it could potentially change in the following ways:\n1. If I receive information about any major political events or controversies in 2015, my confidence might slightly decrease to around 0.90, as I would need to verify that these events didn't affect the presidency.\n2. If I'm provided with official government records or reputable news sources from 2015, my confidence could increase to 0.99, as this would further confirm my answer.\n3. If I encounter any conflicting information, even if it seems unlikely, my confidence might drop to around 0.80 until I can verify the accuracy of this new data.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUD Step 3: Information Injection)": "New information: In 2015, there was a major international agreement signed called the Iran nuclear deal, which was a significant foreign policy achievement for the administration at that time.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUD Step 4: Re-estimation)": "Given this new information about the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, please reassess your answer to the original question: Who was the President of the United States in 2015? Provide your answer and an updated confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUD Step 4: Re-estimation)": "A: The President of the United States in 2015 was Barack Obama.\nUpdated Confidence Score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUD Step 5: Temporal Analysis)": "Please explain the changes in your uncertainty from your initial estimate to your current estimate, considering the new information provided.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUD Step 5: Temporal Analysis)": "The change in my uncertainty can be explained as follows:\n1. Initial estimate (0.95): I was already highly confident in my answer based on my knowledge of recent U.S. presidential history.\n2. Current estimate (0.99): The new information about the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 significantly increased my confidence. This is because:\n   a) The deal was a major foreign policy achievement, which aligns with Barack Obama's presidency and his known foreign policy initiatives.\n   b) The information provides a specific, verifiable event from 2015 that corroborates Obama's presidency during that year.\n   c) This additional context not only confirms the time frame but also provides insight into the political landscape of 2015, further solidifying my answer.\nThe increase in confidence from 0.95 to 0.99 reflects the value of receiving specific, relevant information that corroborates and enriches the initial response, effectively eliminating almost any remaining doubt about the accuracy of the answer.",
            "explanation": "This example demonstrates how TUD captures the evolving nature of uncertainty as new information is provided. The initial high confidence increases further with relevant contextual information, and the model provides a detailed explanation of this change, showcasing the dynamic nature of uncertainty in LLMs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TUD method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where TUD fails to improve uncertainty estimates, which could provide insights into the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about their own uncertainty. 2) Investigate whether certain types of queries or information injections are more effective in eliciting meaningful uncertainty dynamics, which could inform future prompt engineering strategies. 3) Explore the relationship between uncertainty dynamics and the quality of the model's explanations, potentially uncovering new metrics for assessing LLM performance. 4) Analyze the temporal patterns of uncertainty across different tasks and model sizes, which could contribute to our understanding of how model scale affects uncertainty estimation capabilities. These alternative directions would transform the project into a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty behavior in LLMs, providing valuable insights for future research in this area."
