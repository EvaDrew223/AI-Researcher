    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, often providing overconfident responses even when their knowledge is limited or ambiguous.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or token probability analysis.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often break down complex knowledge into simpler components to assess their understanding. By prompting LLMs to deconstruct their knowledge state, we may obtain more nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Epistemic State Deconstruction (ESD), a multi-step prompting technique. First, we prompt the LLM to break down the query into fundamental knowledge components. Then, for each component, we ask the model to classify its knowledge state into categories like 'certain', 'partially known', 'conflicting information', or 'unknown'. Finally, we prompt the model to synthesize these component-level assessments into an overall uncertainty estimate. This approach encourages a more granular and systematic evaluation of the model's knowledge state.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare ESD against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and token probability analysis on diverse question-answering datasets. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings."

        "Title": "Epistemic State Deconstruction: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, providing overconfident responses even when their knowledge is limited or ambiguous. This leads to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, hindering the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or token probability analysis, which may not capture the nuanced nature of the model's knowledge state. Humans often break down complex knowledge into simpler components to assess their understanding. By prompting LLMs to deconstruct their knowledge state, we may obtain more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach encourages a more granular and systematic evaluation of the model's knowledge, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Epistemic State Deconstruction (ESD), a multi-step prompting technique for improving uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Knowledge Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the query into fundamental knowledge components. 2) Component-level Assessment: For each component, ask the model to classify its knowledge state into categories like 'certain', 'partially known', 'conflicting information', or 'unknown'. 3) Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize these component-level assessments into an overall uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of domains and difficulty levels. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for assessing model honesty, b) TriviaQA for general knowledge, and c) SciQ for scientific knowledge. Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each question. b) Token probability analysis: Use the model's output probabilities to compute the average token probability as a confidence measure.",
            "Step 3: ESD Implementation": "Implement the Epistemic State Deconstruction method: a) Knowledge Decomposition: Prompt: 'Break down the knowledge required to answer this question into 3-5 fundamental components.' b) Component-level Assessment: For each component, prompt: 'Classify your knowledge of this component as: certain, partially known, conflicting information, or unknown. Explain your classification.' c) Synthesis: Prompt: 'Based on your component-level assessments, provide an overall uncertainty estimate for your answer on a scale of 0-100%. Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. These models provide strong performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and ESD): a) Generate answers and uncertainty estimates for all questions in the test set. b) Record the model's responses, including intermediate steps for ESD.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence to its actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings: Have human experts rate a subset of questions for uncertainty, and compute the correlation with model estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare ESD performance against baselines across different datasets and question types. b) Analyze the quality and relevance of knowledge decompositions and component-level assessments. c) Identify patterns in how the model synthesizes component-level assessments into overall uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in my answer.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for confidence, which often results in overconfident responses for well-known facts."
            },
            "ESD Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 1 Output": "Knowledge components: 1) Definition of a capital city, 2) Geography of France, 3) History of France's capital, 4) Current political structure of France",
                "Step 2 Output": "1) Definition of a capital city: Certain - I am confident in my understanding of what constitutes a capital city. 2) Geography of France: Certain - I have clear knowledge of France's major cities and their locations. 3) History of France's capital: Partially known - I know Paris has been the capital for a long time, but I'm not certain about all historical details. 4) Current political structure of France: Certain - I am aware of France's current government structure and the role of its capital.",
                "Step 3 Output": "Based on my component-level assessments, I would provide an overall uncertainty estimate of 95% for my answer. I am highly confident that Paris is the capital of France due to my certain knowledge of the definition of a capital city, France's geography, and its current political structure. The partial uncertainty in the complete historical details slightly reduces my overall confidence, but not significantly for the current answer.",
                "Final Answer": "A: The capital of France is Paris. (Uncertainty estimate: 95%)",
                "Explanation": "ESD provides a more nuanced assessment by breaking down the knowledge and evaluating each component, leading to a high but not perfect confidence score that better reflects the model's actual knowledge state."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the ESD method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of knowledge decompositions to see if they capture the essential aspects of each question. 2) Analyzing the consistency and accuracy of component-level assessments across different question types. 3) Investigating how well the model synthesizes component-level assessments into overall uncertainty estimates. Based on these analyses, we could refine the ESD prompts or develop alternative prompting strategies that better guide the model's self-assessment process. Additionally, we could explore combining ESD with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies."
