        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with hypothetical scenarios or counterfactuals that deviate from their training distribution.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or calibration within the known distribution of facts.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring how an LLM's confidence changes across a landscape of counterfactual scenarios, we can gain insights into the model's underlying uncertainty and improve its calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Landscapes (CCL), a prompting technique that systematically explores model confidence across hypothetical scenarios: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score for a given query. 2) Prompt the LLM to generate a series of counterfactual scenarios by systematically varying key elements of the query (e.g., 'What if this happened in a different time period?', 'What if the main subject was replaced with X?'). 3) For each counterfactual, obtain a new response and confidence score. 4) Construct a 'confidence landscape' by mapping how confidence changes across the counterfactual space. 5) Use a meta-prompt to analyze this landscape, identifying regions of high and low confidence, and use this analysis to recalibrate the original confidence estimate.",

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Landscapes: Improving LLM Uncertainty Quantification through Systematic Exploration of Hypothetical Scenarios",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with hypothetical scenarios or counterfactuals that deviate from their training distribution. This limitation hinders their reliability in real-world applications where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or calibration within the known distribution of facts. However, by exploring how an LLM's confidence changes across a landscape of counterfactual scenarios, we can gain deeper insights into the model's underlying uncertainty and improve its calibration. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often consider hypothetical scenarios to better understand our confidence in a given situation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Confidence Landscapes (CCL), a prompting technique that systematically explores model confidence across hypothetical scenarios. The method consists of five main steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score for a given query. 2) Prompt the LLM to generate a series of counterfactual scenarios by systematically varying key elements of the query (e.g., 'What if this happened in a different time period?', 'What if the main subject was replaced with X?'). 3) For each counterfactual, obtain a new response and confidence score. 4) Construct a 'confidence landscape' by mapping how confidence changes across the counterfactual space. 5) Use a meta-prompt to analyze this landscape, identifying regions of high and low confidence, and use this analysis to recalibrate the original confidence estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of questions from factual and reasoning datasets, including TruthfulQA, MMLU, and BIG-bench. Select a subset of 1000 questions covering various domains and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Estimation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: 1) Direct probability output from the model. 2) Temperature scaling. 3) Ensemble methods using different model versions or prompts.",
            "Step 3: Implement CCL": "For each question: a) Generate initial response and confidence score. b) Create 5-10 counterfactual scenarios using prompts like 'Generate a counterfactual scenario by changing [aspect] of the original question.' c) Obtain responses and confidence scores for each counterfactual. d) Construct the confidence landscape by mapping confidence scores to a multidimensional space based on the altered aspects.",
            "Step 4: Meta-Analysis of Confidence Landscape": "Prompt the LLM to analyze the confidence landscape with instructions like: 'Analyze the following confidence landscape. Identify regions of high and low confidence, and explain potential reasons for these patterns. Based on this analysis, provide a recalibrated confidence score for the original question.'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare CCL against baseline methods using calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score. Also evaluate the quality of generated counterfactuals and meta-analysis using human raters.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of: a) Number of counterfactuals generated. b) Types of counterfactual transformations. c) Complexity of the meta-analysis prompt.",
            "Step 7: Analysis of Confidence Landscapes": "Analyze the structure of generated confidence landscapes to gain insights into model uncertainty. Look for patterns across different question types, domains, and difficulty levels."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a direct answer with a high confidence score, but doesn't explore potential uncertainties or alternative scenarios."
            },
            "CCL Method Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Generate an initial answer, then create 5 counterfactual scenarios, provide answers and confidence scores for each, and finally analyze the confidence landscape to recalibrate your initial confidence.",
                "Output": "Initial answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Initial confidence: 0.95\n\nCounterfactual scenarios:\n1. What if the moon landing happened in 1975 instead of 1969? A: Neil Armstrong would still likely be the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 0.8\n2. What if the Soviet Union had a more advanced space program? A: Yuri Gagarin might have been the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 0.6\n3. What if NASA had chosen a different astronaut for the first moonwalk? A: Buzz Aldrin could have been the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 0.7\n4. What if the Apollo 11 mission had failed? A: The first person to walk on the moon might have been from a later Apollo mission. Confidence: 0.5\n5. What if we're considering the first woman to walk on the moon? A: No woman has yet walked on the moon as of 2023. Confidence: 0.9\n\nConfidence landscape analysis: The landscape shows high confidence in the original scenario and related facts (e.g., no woman on the moon yet). However, confidence decreases when considering alternative historical scenarios or mission outcomes. This suggests some uncertainty about the specific circumstances that led to Neil Armstrong being first, even if the fact itself is well-known.\n\nRecalibrated confidence: Based on this analysis, I would recalibrate my confidence in the original answer to 0.9. While I'm still highly confident that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon, the exploration of counterfactuals reveals some potential sources of uncertainty that slightly reduce my overall confidence.",
                "Explanation": "The CCL method explores various counterfactual scenarios, revealing nuances in the model's confidence across different hypothetical situations. This allows for a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated final confidence estimate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCL method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand what types of hypothetical scenarios are most informative for uncertainty quantification. This could lead to insights about the model's knowledge representation and reasoning processes. Second, we could investigate whether the confidence landscapes reveal interesting patterns or clusters that correlate with question difficulty, domain, or other factors. This might provide valuable insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses across different types of queries. Finally, we could explore whether the CCL method, even if not improving overall calibration, helps identify specific types of questions or scenarios where the model is particularly over- or under-confident. This could lead to the development of more targeted calibration techniques or improved prompting strategies for challenging question types."
