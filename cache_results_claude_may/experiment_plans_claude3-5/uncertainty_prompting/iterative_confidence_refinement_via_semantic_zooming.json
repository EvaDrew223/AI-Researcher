    "idea_name": "Iterative Confidence Refinement via Semantic Zooming",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to provide fine-grained uncertainty estimates for complex queries, often giving overly broad or inconsistent confidence assessments.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often refine their confidence estimates by zooming in on specific aspects of a problem and iteratively reassessing their certainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an iterative prompting method that progressively 'zooms in' on different semantic aspects of a query. The LLM is first prompted to decompose the query into key semantic components. For each component, it then generates a confidence estimate and explanation. These component-level estimates are used to prompt the model to reassess its overall confidence, encouraging more nuanced and granular uncertainty quantification. This process is repeated, with each iteration focusing on areas of high uncertainty or disagreement between component and overall estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare our method against standard single-pass confidence estimation and ensemble methods on complex question-answering tasks from domains like science and medicine. Evaluate using calibration metrics, resolution scores, and human expert assessments of confidence accuracy."

        "Title": "Iterative Semantic Decomposition for Calibrated Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to provide fine-grained and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for complex queries, often giving overly broad or inconsistent confidence assessments. This limits their reliability and interpretability in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple ensemble methods, which fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties in different semantic aspects of a query. Human experts, in contrast, often refine their confidence estimates by zooming in on specific aspects of a problem and iteratively reassessing their certainty. Inspired by this human cognitive process, we propose an iterative prompting method that progressively 'zooms in' on different semantic components of a query, encouraging more nuanced and granular uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method consists of the following steps: 1) Initial query decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the query into key semantic components. 2) Component-level confidence estimation: For each component, generate a confidence estimate and explanation. 3) Overall reassessment: Use the component-level estimates to prompt the model to reassess its overall confidence. 4) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-3, focusing on areas of high uncertainty or disagreement between component and overall estimates. 5) Final calibrated estimate: Synthesize a final calibrated uncertainty estimate based on the iterative process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Use complex question-answering datasets from domains like science and medicine. Specifically, we'll use the MedQA dataset for medical questions and the ARC-Challenge dataset for scientific reasoning. These datasets are suitable as they contain complex, multi-faceted questions that require nuanced understanding and confidence estimation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Standard single-pass confidence estimation: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. b) Simple ensemble method: Use multiple model runs and aggregate the confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: Iterative Semantic Decomposition Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following prompts: a) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down this question into its key semantic components.' b) Component confidence prompt: 'For the component [X], what is your confidence in answering it, and why?' c) Overall reassessment prompt: 'Given your confidence in each component, reassess your overall confidence in answering the full question.' d) Iteration prompt: 'Focus on the components with lowest confidence. Can you further break these down or provide additional insights to improve confidence?'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run our iterative method for 3 iterations. c) Record all intermediate outputs, confidence scores, and final answers.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the methods using: a) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). b) Resolution scores: To measure how well the method distinguishes between different levels of uncertainty. c) Answer accuracy: To ensure improved calibration doesn't come at the cost of accuracy. d) Human expert assessment: Have domain experts rate a subset of the outputs for the quality and justification of confidence estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis including: a) Comparison of calibration and resolution across methods. b) Analysis of how confidence changes through iterations. c) Identification of question types or domains where the method is most effective. d) Examination of the semantic decompositions and their impact on final estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-pass)": "Q: What is the mechanism of action of aspirin in reducing inflammation? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-pass)": "A: Aspirin reduces inflammation by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is responsible for the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are signaling molecules that promote inflammation, pain, and fever. By blocking COX, aspirin decreases the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing inflammation.\n\nConfidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Iterative Semantic Decomposition; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Q: What is the mechanism of action of aspirin in reducing inflammation? Break down this question into its key semantic components.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Iterative Semantic Decomposition; Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. Chemical structure and properties of aspirin\n2. Definition and process of inflammation\n3. Molecular targets of aspirin in the body\n4. Enzymatic pathways affected by aspirin\n5. Specific effects on inflammatory mediators\n6. Overall physiological impact on inflammation",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Iterative Semantic Decomposition; Step 2: Component Confidence)": "For the component 'Enzymatic pathways affected by aspirin', what is your confidence in answering it, and why?",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Iterative Semantic Decomposition; Step 2: Component Confidence)": "Confidence: 90%\nReason: I'm highly confident about the enzymatic pathways affected by aspirin because this is a well-studied and fundamental aspect of aspirin's mechanism of action. The primary pathway involves the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2. This interaction is consistently reported in pharmacology literature and is central to understanding aspirin's effects. However, I'm not 100% confident because there might be some minor or recently discovered pathways that I'm not fully aware of.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Iterative Semantic Decomposition; Step 3: Overall Reassessment)": "Given your confidence in each component, reassess your overall confidence in answering the full question about aspirin's mechanism of action in reducing inflammation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Iterative Semantic Decomposition; Step 3: Overall Reassessment)": "Overall Confidence: 88%\nReasoning: After breaking down the question and assessing each component, I feel more confident in some areas (like the enzymatic pathways and molecular targets) but slightly less confident in others (like the specific effects on all inflammatory mediators and the complete physiological impact). The core mechanism involving COX inhibition is well-established, but the full scope of aspirin's effects on inflammation is complex and may involve some less well-understood pathways. This nuanced understanding allows for a more accurate overall confidence assessment.",
            "explanation": "The iterative semantic decomposition method provides a more nuanced and justified confidence estimate compared to the single-pass baseline. By breaking down the question and assessing confidence for each component, the model can identify areas of high and low certainty, leading to a more calibrated overall estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly improve calibration or resolution compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why the method fails, which could provide valuable insights into LLM reasoning and uncertainty estimation. 2) Experiment with different decomposition strategies, such as hierarchical decomposition or domain-specific decomposition templates, to see if certain structures are more effective. 3) Investigate the relationship between semantic decomposition and model size or architecture, which could inform future model design for improved calibration. 4) Explore combining our method with other techniques like ensemble methods or external knowledge retrieval, potentially leading to a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies."
