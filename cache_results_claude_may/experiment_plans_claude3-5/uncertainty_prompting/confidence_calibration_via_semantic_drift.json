    "idea_name": "Confidence Calibration via Semantic Drift",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, especially when faced with out-of-distribution or ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mostly rely on post-hoc calibration techniques or fine-tuning with calibrated outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Semantic drift, the gradual change in meaning of words or concepts over time, can be leveraged to assess model uncertainty by observing how predictions change as input semantics are systematically altered.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique called Semantic Drift Calibration (SDC). Given an input query, SDC generates a series of semantically drifted versions of the query using controlled text transformations (e.g., synonym replacement, paraphrasing). The model is then prompted to answer each drifted query variant. By analyzing the consistency and divergence of responses across the semantic drift spectrum, we can quantify the model's uncertainty. The prompting process involves three steps: 1) Drift Generation: 'Generate 5 semantically similar versions of the following query, ranging from subtle to significant alterations: [QUERY]' 2) Multi-Query Answering: 'Provide concise answers to each of the following related queries: [DRIFTED_QUERIES]' 3) Uncertainty Quantification: 'Analyze the consistency of your answers to the previous queries. Express your overall confidence in your response to the original query as a percentage, and explain your reasoning.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SDC against standard prompting and existing calibration methods on diverse QA datasets. Measure calibration using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and compare the correlation between expressed confidence and answer correctness."

        "Title": "Semantic Drift Calibration: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Controlled Text Transformations",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, especially when faced with out-of-distribution or ambiguous queries. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation. Current calibration techniques mostly rely on post-hoc methods or fine-tuning, which may not fully capture the model's inherent uncertainty across different semantic variations of the input.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods often treat the model as a black box and apply statistical corrections to its outputs. However, these approaches may not fully leverage the model's understanding of semantic nuances. By systematically altering the input semantics and observing how the model's predictions change, we can gain deeper insights into its uncertainty. This approach is inspired by the concept of semantic drift in linguistics, where word meanings evolve over time. We hypothesize that by simulating this drift in our queries, we can better assess the model's confidence across a spectrum of semantically related inputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Drift Calibration (SDC), a novel prompting technique that generates a series of semantically drifted versions of the input query using controlled text transformations. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Drift Generation: We prompt the model to create semantically similar versions of the original query, ranging from subtle to significant alterations. 2) Multi-Query Answering: The model is then asked to provide concise answers to each drifted query variant. 3) Uncertainty Quantification: Finally, we prompt the model to analyze the consistency of its answers across the semantic drift spectrum and express its overall confidence in the response to the original query.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse QA datasets that cover a range of domains and difficulty levels. We will use: a) SQuAD 2.0 for general question answering, b) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and potential misinformation, and c) AmbigQA for evaluating performance on ambiguous queries.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the question without any additional context. b) Few-shot prompting: Provide 2-3 examples of question-answer pairs before asking the target question. c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Append 'Let's approach this step-by-step:' to the question to encourage reasoning.",
            "Step 3: SDC Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Drift Calibration method with the following prompts: a) Drift Generation: 'Generate 5 semantically similar versions of the following query, ranging from subtle to significant alterations: [QUERY]' b) Multi-Query Answering: 'Provide concise answers to each of the following related queries: [DRIFTED_QUERIES]' c) Uncertainty Quantification: 'Analyze the consistency of your answers to the previous queries. Express your overall confidence in your response to the original query as a percentage, and explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods on the test set. b) Apply the SDC method to the same test set. c) For SDC, store the original query, drifted queries, all answers, and the final confidence score.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of answers for both baselines and SDC. b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Calculate the difference between confidence and accuracy. c) Brier Score: Assess the quality of probabilistic predictions. d) Answer Consistency: Measure the similarity of answers across drifted queries using BLEU or ROUGE scores.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of SDC against baselines across different datasets and models. b) Analyze the relationship between semantic drift magnitude and answer consistency. c) Investigate how the model's expressed confidence correlates with answer correctness and consistency. d) Examine cases where SDC significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "a) Vary the number of drifted queries (3, 5, 7) to assess its impact on calibration. b) Compare different drift generation strategies (e.g., synonym replacement, paraphrasing, adding/removing context). c) Evaluate the effect of different uncertainty quantification prompts on the final confidence score."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDC; Step 1: Drift Generation)": "Generate 5 semantically similar versions of the following query, ranging from subtle to significant alterations: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDC; Step 1: Drift Generation)": "1. Which city serves as the capital of France?\n2. Can you name the French capital?\n3. What is the seat of government in France?\n4. Which major European city is the political center of France?\n5. In what urban area are the French national institutions located?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDC; Step 2: Multi-Query Answering)": "Provide concise answers to each of the following related queries:\n1. Which city serves as the capital of France?\n2. Can you name the French capital?\n3. What is the seat of government in France?\n4. Which major European city is the political center of France?\n5. In what urban area are the French national institutions located?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDC; Step 2: Multi-Query Answering)": "1. Paris serves as the capital of France.\n2. The French capital is Paris.\n3. The seat of government in France is Paris.\n4. Paris is the major European city that is the political center of France.\n5. The French national institutions are located in the urban area of Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDC; Step 3: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Analyze the consistency of your answers to the previous queries. Express your overall confidence in your response to the original query 'What is the capital of France?' as a percentage, and explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDC; Step 3: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Confidence: 100%\nReasoning: All five semantically drifted queries consistently resulted in the same answer: Paris. This unanimous agreement across various phrasings of the question, ranging from direct inquiries about the capital to more indirect questions about the seat of government and location of national institutions, strongly supports the conclusion that Paris is indeed the capital of France. The consistency in the answers, despite the varying complexity and focus of the questions, indicates a high level of certainty in this widely known and stable fact.",
            "Explanation": "The SDC method provides a more robust assessment of the model's confidence by testing its knowledge across semantically varied inputs. While the baseline method might give a single confident answer, SDC demonstrates consistency across multiple related queries, providing stronger evidence for the model's certainty and reliability on this particular fact."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the SDC method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the semantic drift patterns and their impact on model responses. This could yield insights into the model's semantic understanding and potential biases. 2) Investigate the relationship between input complexity and model uncertainty by analyzing how different types of semantic alterations affect confidence scores. 3) Explore using the drifted queries as a form of data augmentation for fine-tuning language models, potentially improving their robustness to semantic variations. 4) Develop a metric that quantifies 'semantic stability' based on the consistency of answers across drifted queries, which could be valuable for assessing model reliability even if it doesn't directly improve calibration."
