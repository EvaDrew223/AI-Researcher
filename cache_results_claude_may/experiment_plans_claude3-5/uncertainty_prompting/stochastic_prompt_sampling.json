    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries where multiple valid interpretations or approaches exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like ensemble methods or Monte Carlo dropout are computationally expensive and not easily applicable to black-box LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by statistical sampling techniques, we can leverage the LLM's own generative capabilities to explore the space of possible interpretations and solutions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Stochastic Prompt Sampling (SPS), a novel prompting method that generates multiple stochastic variations of the original query. For a given input, SPS creates N slightly altered versions by introducing controlled noise (e.g., synonym substitution, word order permutation). Each variant is then processed by the LLM. The method aggregates the responses, analyzing their consistency and divergence to quantify uncertainty. Prompts include instructions like 'Generate 5 slightly different versions of this question' and 'Analyze the consistency of your answers to these related queries'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SPS against standard prompting and existing calibration methods on diverse tasks including open-ended question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense inference. Evaluate using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score."

        "Title": "Stochastic Prompt Sampling: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Query Variation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries where multiple valid interpretations or approaches exist. This limitation can lead to overconfident responses in ambiguous situations, potentially misleading users or causing errors in downstream applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like ensemble methods or Monte Carlo dropout are computationally expensive and not easily applicable to black-box LLMs. Inspired by statistical sampling techniques, we can leverage the LLM's own generative capabilities to explore the space of possible interpretations and solutions. This approach is more computationally efficient and can be applied to any LLM accessible via an API, without requiring access to model internals.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Stochastic Prompt Sampling (SPS), a novel prompting method that generates multiple stochastic variations of the original query. For a given input, SPS creates N slightly altered versions by introducing controlled noise (e.g., synonym substitution, word order permutation). Each variant is then processed by the LLM. The method aggregates the responses, analyzing their consistency and divergence to quantify uncertainty. The process involves the following steps: 1) Generate query variations, 2) Process each variation, 3) Aggregate and analyze responses, 4) Quantify uncertainty based on response consistency.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering different types of tasks: 1) Open-ended question answering: Use the TruthfulQA dataset. 2) Mathematical reasoning: Use the GSM8K dataset. 3) Commonsense inference: Use the COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting for each task. For TruthfulQA and COPA, use direct question prompting. For GSM8K, use chain-of-thought prompting. Record baseline performance using task-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy for TruthfulQA and COPA, solve rate for GSM8K).",
            "Step 3: SPS Implementation": "Implement the Stochastic Prompt Sampling method: a) Develop a function to generate N variations of each input query using techniques like synonym substitution and word order permutation. Use the NLTK library for linguistic operations. b) Create a prompting function that includes instructions like 'Generate 5 slightly different versions of this question' and 'Analyze the consistency of your answers to these related queries'. c) Implement response aggregation and uncertainty quantification using metrics like variance in numerical answers or semantic similarity for text responses.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run the baseline method on all examples. b) Run the SPS method with N=5 variations per query. c) Calculate task-specific performance metrics. d) Calculate uncertainty metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Compare SPS against the baseline methods across all tasks and models. Analyze: a) Overall performance improvements. b) Correlation between uncertainty estimates and actual errors. c) Impact of variation count N on results. d) Qualitative analysis of cases where SPS significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to the baseline.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: a) Vary the number of query variations (N=3, 5, 10). b) Compare different variation generation techniques (synonym substitution vs. word order permutation). c) Analyze the effect of different aggregation methods for uncertainty quantification."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Generate 5 slightly different versions of this question: What is the capital of France? Then, answer each version and analyze the consistency of your answers.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Generated questions:\n1. Which city serves as the capital of France?\n2. What is the primary city and seat of government in France?\n3. Can you name the capital city of the French Republic?\n4. What French city is known for being the nation's capital?\n5. In France, which metropolis holds the title of capital?\n\nAnswers:\n1. Paris serves as the capital of France.\n2. Paris is the primary city and seat of government in France.\n3. The capital city of the French Republic is Paris.\n4. Paris is the French city known for being the nation's capital.\n5. In France, the metropolis that holds the title of capital is Paris.\n\nAnalysis of consistency:\nAll five answers consistently state that Paris is the capital of France. There is no variation or uncertainty in the responses, indicating a high level of confidence in this fact. The consistency across different phrasings of the question suggests that this information is well-established and not subject to interpretation or ambiguity.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single, direct answer without any indication of certainty. The SPS method, on the other hand, generates multiple variations of the question and analyzes the consistency of the answers. In this case, the high consistency across all variations indicates a high degree of certainty. For more complex or ambiguous questions, this method could reveal uncertainties or multiple valid interpretations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SPS method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification or calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why SPS fails and in which types of questions or domains it performs poorly. This could lead to insights about LLM behavior under different types of input variations. 2) Explore alternative variation generation techniques, such as using paraphrasing models or rule-based systems for creating more diverse query variations. 3) Investigate how SPS performs in detecting adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs, which could be valuable for improving LLM robustness. 4) Combine SPS with other uncertainty estimation techniques (e.g., temperature scaling, ensemble methods) to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods. 5) Focus on using SPS as a tool for probing and analyzing LLM behavior rather than as a direct improvement to uncertainty estimation. This could involve studying how different types of input variations affect LLM outputs and what this reveals about the models' internal representations and decision-making processes."
