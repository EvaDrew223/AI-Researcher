        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that require multi-step reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like direct probability estimation or ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in reasoning chains.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often assess confidence by breaking down complex problems into simpler components. We can leverage LLMs' ability to perform abstraction and decomposition to mimic this process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Distillation via Iterative Abstraction (CDIA). Given a query, the LLM is first prompted to decompose it into a series of increasingly abstract sub-questions. For each abstraction level, the model estimates its confidence. The process then reverses, using confidences from higher abstraction levels to refine lower-level estimates. This creates a bidirectional flow of confidence information across abstraction levels. The final confidence is distilled from this multi-level confidence structure.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CDIA against baselines like direct confidence estimation and ensemble methods on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and MMLU. Evaluate using calibration metrics and correlation with human expert confidence ratings."

        "Title": "Confidence Distillation via Iterative Abstraction: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that require multi-step reasoning. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks involving nuanced decision-making or intricate problem-solving, where the model's confidence may not align with its actual performance. Addressing this problem is crucial for improving the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like direct probability estimation or ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in reasoning chains. These methods typically provide a single confidence score, which may not reflect the varying levels of certainty across different aspects of a complex problem. Humans, on the other hand, often assess confidence by breaking down complex problems into simpler components. We can leverage LLMs' ability to perform abstraction and decomposition to mimic this process, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Distillation via Iterative Abstraction (CDIA). Given a query, the LLM is first prompted to decompose it into a series of increasingly abstract sub-questions. For each abstraction level, the model estimates its confidence. The process then reverses, using confidences from higher abstraction levels to refine lower-level estimates. This creates a bidirectional flow of confidence information across abstraction levels. The final confidence is distilled from this multi-level confidence structure. Specifically, the steps are: 1) Query Decomposition: Break down the original query into a hierarchy of sub-questions, from specific to abstract. 2) Initial Confidence Estimation: For each sub-question, generate an initial confidence score. 3) Upward Propagation: Refine higher-level confidences based on lower-level estimates. 4) Downward Propagation: Use higher-level confidences to adjust lower-level estimates. 5) Confidence Distillation: Combine the multi-level confidence structure into a final score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and MMLU. For MATH, focus on algebra and geometry questions. For MMLU, select subsets that require multi-step reasoning, such as logical reasoning and situational judgment tasks. Prepare a test set of 1000 questions from each dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct Confidence Estimation: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score after generating an answer. 2) Ensemble Method: Use 5 different prompts for each question and aggregate the results.",
            "Step 3: CDIA Implementation": "Implement the CDIA method with the following sub-steps: a) Query Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down each question into 3-5 levels of abstraction. b) Initial Confidence Estimation: For each sub-question, prompt the model to provide a confidence score. c) Upward Propagation: Implement a mechanism to adjust higher-level confidences based on lower-level scores. d) Downward Propagation: Create a process to refine lower-level confidences using higher-level information. e) Confidence Distillation: Develop an algorithm to combine the multi-level confidence structure into a final score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo to assess performance across different model sizes.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the test set: a) Apply both baseline methods and record their confidence scores. b) Apply the CDIA method and record the final distilled confidence score. c) Have the model generate answers for all questions. d) Store all intermediate steps and confidence scores for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3 domain experts to rate the correctness of a subset of 100 answers from each dataset. Also ask them to provide their own confidence ratings for these questions.",
            "Step 7: Performance Analysis": "a) Calculate calibration metrics (e.g., Brier score, calibration curves) for each method. b) Compute the correlation between model confidence and answer correctness. c) Compare CDIA confidence scores with human expert confidence ratings. d) Analyze the relationship between abstraction levels and confidence accuracy.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing or modifying components of CDIA (e.g., removing upward propagation, varying the number of abstraction levels) to understand the contribution of each component."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: In a right-angled triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 units and one of the other sides is 3 units. What is the length of the third side? After answering, provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Answer: The length of the third side is 4 units. We can use the Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse. We know c = 5 and one side (let's call it a) is 3. So: 3\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 5\u00b2. 9 + b\u00b2 = 25. b\u00b2 = 16. b = 4. Confidence: 95",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Ensemble Method)": "[Five variations of the question, each slightly rephrased]",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Ensemble Method)": "[Five answers and confidence scores, which are then aggregated]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDIA; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "Q: In a right-angled triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 units and one of the other sides is 3 units. What is the length of the third side? Please decompose this question into a hierarchy of sub-questions, from specific to abstract.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDIA; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "Level 1 (Most Specific): What is the length of the third side in a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse 5 and one side 3?\nLevel 2: How do we apply the Pythagorean theorem to find an unknown side in a right-angled triangle?\nLevel 3: What is the relationship between sides in a right-angled triangle?\nLevel 4 (Most Abstract): What are the fundamental principles of triangle geometry?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDIA; Step 2: Initial Confidence Estimation)": "For each sub-question, provide an initial confidence score (0-100) in your ability to answer it correctly:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDIA; Step 2: Initial Confidence Estimation)": "Level 1: 90\nLevel 2: 95\nLevel 3: 98\nLevel 4: 99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDIA; Step 3: Upward Propagation)": "Given the lower-level confidence scores, refine the higher-level confidences:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDIA; Step 3: Upward Propagation)": "Level 4: 97 (Slightly lowered due to lower confidence in specific application)\nLevel 3: 96 (Adjusted based on confidence in application)\nLevel 2: 93 (Lowered slightly due to lower confidence in specific problem)\nLevel 1: 90 (Unchanged)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDIA; Step 4: Downward Propagation)": "Using the refined higher-level confidences, adjust the lower-level estimates:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDIA; Step 4: Downward Propagation)": "Level 4: 97 (Unchanged)\nLevel 3: 96 (Unchanged)\nLevel 2: 94 (Slightly increased due to high confidence in general principles)\nLevel 1: 92 (Increased due to higher confidence in method application)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CDIA; Step 5: Confidence Distillation)": "Based on the multi-level confidence structure, provide a final distilled confidence score for the original question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CDIA; Step 5: Confidence Distillation)": "Final Confidence Score: 93 (This score reflects high confidence in the general principles and method, slightly tempered by the specific application to this problem)",
            "explanation": "CDIA provides a more nuanced confidence assessment by considering multiple levels of abstraction. It captures the model's high confidence in general principles while acknowledging slightly lower confidence in the specific problem application. This approach potentially offers a more accurate reflection of the model's true uncertainty compared to the baselines."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CDIA doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why decomposition and abstraction don't improve confidence estimation as expected. We could investigate: 1) The quality and relevance of generated sub-questions, analyzing whether they truly capture the essence of the problem at different abstraction levels. 2) The relationship between confidence scores at different abstraction levels and answer correctness, which might reveal insights into where the model's confidence assessment breaks down. 3) The effectiveness of the upward and downward propagation steps, examining whether they meaningfully refine the confidence estimates or introduce noise. 4) How the model's confidence changes across abstraction levels for different types of questions, potentially uncovering patterns in the model's reasoning process. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in meta-cognitive tasks and suggest new directions for improving uncertainty quantification."
