        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to consider alternative scenarios or interpretations when answering questions, leading to overconfidence in potentially ambiguous situations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on generating a single answer or a limited set of alternatives without systematically exploring divergent scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to actively generate and explore divergent scenarios, we can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of potential ambiguities and uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Scenario Exploration (DSE), a prompting technique that guides LLMs to: (1) Generate multiple interpretations or scenarios for a given query, (2) Explore the implications and answers for each scenario, (3) Assess the relative likelihoods of different scenarios, and (4) Synthesize a final answer and confidence score based on the exploration. The prompts are carefully crafted to encourage creative yet relevant scenario generation and proper probabilistic reasoning in the synthesis step.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate DSE on ambiguous question answering datasets and commonsense reasoning tasks. Compare against standard prompting and Chain-of-Thought approaches in terms of accuracy, calibration, and the quality/diversity of generated scenarios as assessed by human judges."

        "Title": "Divergent Scenario Exploration: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Systematic Ambiguity Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to consider alternative scenarios or interpretations when answering questions, leading to overconfidence in potentially ambiguous situations. This overconfidence can result in incorrect or misleading responses, particularly in complex or nuanced contexts where multiple valid interpretations may exist.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically focus on generating a single answer or a limited set of alternatives without systematically exploring divergent scenarios. By prompting LLMs to actively generate and explore divergent scenarios, we can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of potential ambiguities and uncertainties. This approach leverages the LLM's inherent capabilities to reason about multiple possibilities, potentially leading to more robust and calibrated responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Scenario Exploration (DSE), a prompting technique that guides LLMs through a structured process of scenario generation and analysis. The method consists of four main steps: (1) Generate multiple interpretations or scenarios for a given query, (2) Explore the implications and answers for each scenario, (3) Assess the relative likelihoods of different scenarios, and (4) Synthesize a final answer and confidence score based on the exploration. The prompts are carefully crafted to encourage creative yet relevant scenario generation and proper probabilistic reasoning in the synthesis step.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select and prepare datasets that contain ambiguous questions or scenarios. We will use: (1) AmbigQA dataset for ambiguous question answering, (2) StrategyQA dataset for multi-step reasoning questions, and (3) TruthfulQA dataset for questions that require distinguishing between true and false information.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting as baselines. For standard prompting, directly ask the question. For CoT, append 'Let's approach this step-by-step:' to the question.",
            "Step 3: DSE Prompt Design": "Design a series of prompts for each step of the DSE process: (1) Scenario Generation: 'Given the question \"{question}\", generate 3-5 distinct possible interpretations or scenarios.', (2) Scenario Exploration: 'For each scenario, provide a detailed answer and explanation.', (3) Likelihood Assessment: 'Assign a probability to each scenario, ensuring they sum to 100%.', (4) Final Synthesis: 'Based on the scenarios and their likelihoods, provide a final answer and a confidence score (0-100).'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for the experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (a) Run the baseline methods, (b) Run the DSE method, (c) Collect the outputs, including intermediate steps for DSE.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Answer Accuracy: Compare final answers against ground truth, (2) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy, (3) Scenario Diversity: Use embedding-based similarity measures to quantify the diversity of generated scenarios, (4) Human Evaluation: Recruit 3-5 expert annotators to rate the quality and relevance of generated scenarios on a subset of 100 questions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare DSE against baselines in terms of: (1) Overall accuracy, (2) Calibration of confidence scores, (3) Ability to identify truly ambiguous questions, (4) Quality and diversity of generated scenarios. Conduct ablation studies by removing individual steps of DSE to assess their impact.",
            "Step 8: Error Analysis": "Manually analyze a subset of examples where DSE performs significantly better or worse than baselines to identify patterns and potential areas for improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He and his team reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911, beating the British expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott by about a month.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DSE; Step 1: Scenario Generation)": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole? Generate 3-5 distinct possible interpretations or scenarios for this question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DSE; Step 1: Scenario Generation)": "1. The question refers to the first person to reach the geographic South Pole.\n2. The question might be asking about the first person to reach the South Magnetic Pole.\n3. The question could be interpreted as asking about the first person to reach the Pole of Inaccessibility in Antarctica.\n4. The question might be referring to the first person to reach the South Pole by land.\n5. The question could be asking about the first person to reach the South Pole and return alive.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DSE; Step 2: Scenario Exploration)": "For each scenario, provide a detailed answer and explanation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DSE; Step 2: Scenario Exploration)": "1. Geographic South Pole: Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer, was the first person to reach the geographic South Pole on December 14, 1911. He led a team of five men who used dog sleds to traverse the Antarctic continent.\n2. South Magnetic Pole: The first person to reach the South Magnetic Pole was Sir Douglas Mawson, an Australian geologist and Antarctic explorer. He reached it on January 16, 1909, during the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton.\n3. Pole of Inaccessibility: The first people to reach the Southern Pole of Inaccessibility were members of the 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition, led by Yevgeny Tolstikov, on December 14, 1958.\n4. First by land: Roald Amundsen's 1911 expedition was also the first to reach the South Pole by land. Previous expeditions had only managed to reach Antarctica by sea.\n5. First to reach and return alive: While Roald Amundsen was the first to reach the South Pole, both he and his team returned safely. Robert Falcon Scott's team also reached the pole about a month later but perished on the return journey.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DSE; Step 3: Likelihood Assessment)": "Assign a probability to each scenario, ensuring they sum to 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DSE; Step 3: Likelihood Assessment)": "1. Geographic South Pole: 70%\n2. South Magnetic Pole: 10%\n3. Pole of Inaccessibility: 5%\n4. First by land: 10%\n5. First to reach and return alive: 5%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DSE; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on the scenarios and their likelihoods, provide a final answer and a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DSE; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The first person to reach the South Pole was most likely Roald Amundsen, who reached the geographic South Pole on December 14, 1911. However, there is some ambiguity in the question as it could potentially refer to other 'South Poles' such as the magnetic pole or the pole of inaccessibility, or specifically to reaching the pole by land or returning alive.\n\nConfidence Score: 75\n\nExplanation: While the most probable interpretation (70%) points to Roald Amundsen as the first to reach the geographic South Pole, the existence of other valid interpretations slightly reduces our overall confidence. The confidence score of 75 reflects high certainty in Amundsen's achievement while acknowledging the potential for alternative interpretations.",
            "explanation": "The DSE method systematically explores multiple interpretations of the question, providing a more nuanced and calibrated response compared to the baseline. It acknowledges the potential ambiguity in the question and provides a confidence score that reflects this uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DSE method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing why LLMs struggle with ambiguity and uncertainty quantification. We could conduct a detailed error analysis to categorize the types of ambiguities that are most challenging for LLMs to identify and handle. Additionally, we could investigate how the number and diversity of generated scenarios correlate with answer accuracy and calibration. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling ambiguous queries and inform future research directions for improving their performance in such scenarios. We could also explore combining DSE with other techniques like few-shot learning or chain-of-thought prompting to see if hybrid approaches yield better results."
