        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods often struggle with complex, hierarchical tasks where uncertainty may exist at multiple levels of abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on a single level of uncertainty, either at the token, sentence, or overall response level.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by fractal geometry, where similar patterns repeat at different scales, we propose that uncertainty in language models can be decomposed into self-similar structures across different levels of abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition (FUD), a recursive prompting technique that decomposes uncertainty across multiple levels. The process involves: (1) Initial response generation and top-level uncertainty estimation. (2) Recursive decomposition, where the model is prompted to break down its response into smaller components and estimate uncertainty for each. (3) Further decomposition of each component, continuing until reaching a predefined granularity or the model indicates no further meaningful decomposition is possible. (4) Fractal reconstruction, where uncertainties at different levels are aggregated using a novel fractal dimension-inspired metric. This method allows for a multi-scale view of uncertainty, capturing both fine-grained and high-level sources of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate FUD against single-level uncertainty estimation methods on hierarchical tasks like multi-step reasoning or nested question-answering. Develop new evaluation metrics that consider the multi-scale nature of the uncertainty estimates, such as a 'fractal uncertainty score' that measures how well the method captures uncertainty across different scales."

        "Title": "Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition: A Multi-Scale Approach to Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often struggle with complex, hierarchical tasks where uncertainty may exist at multiple levels of abstraction. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret model confidence across different scales of reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on a single level of uncertainty, either at the token, sentence, or overall response level. This oversimplification fails to capture the nuanced, multi-layered nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by fractal geometry, where similar patterns repeat at different scales, we propose that uncertainty in language models can be decomposed into self-similar structures across different levels of abstraction. This approach allows for a more comprehensive and granular understanding of model uncertainty, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition (FUD), a recursive prompting technique that decomposes uncertainty across multiple levels. The process involves four main steps: (1) Initial response generation and top-level uncertainty estimation. (2) Recursive decomposition, where the model is prompted to break down its response into smaller components and estimate uncertainty for each. (3) Further decomposition of each component, continuing until reaching a predefined granularity or the model indicates no further meaningful decomposition is possible. (4) Fractal reconstruction, where uncertainties at different levels are aggregated using a novel fractal dimension-inspired metric.",

            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: (1) MultiRC for multi-hop reasoning, (2) StrategyQA for strategic reasoning, and (3) MATH for mathematical problem-solving. These datasets cover a range of complex, hierarchical reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty quantification methods: (1) Monte Carlo Dropout, (2) Deep Ensembles, and (3) Temperature Scaling. Apply these methods to the chosen datasets using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models.",
            "Step 3: FUD Implementation": "Implement the Fractal Uncertainty Decomposition method: (a) Generate initial response and top-level uncertainty. (b) Implement recursive decomposition prompting. (c) Develop stopping criteria for decomposition. (d) Implement fractal reconstruction algorithm.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of FUD: (1) Initial response generation, (2) Uncertainty estimation, (3) Recursive decomposition, (4) Component-level uncertainty estimation. Iterate on prompts to optimize performance.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement evaluation metrics: (1) Calibration error, (2) Brier score, (3) A novel 'fractal uncertainty score' that measures how well the method captures uncertainty across different scales.",
            "Step 6: Experiments": "Run experiments comparing FUD against baselines on all datasets. Vary decomposition depth and reconstruction parameters to analyze their impact on performance.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze results, focusing on: (1) Overall performance comparison, (2) Performance across different task types, (3) Impact of decomposition depth on uncertainty estimates, (4) Correlation between fractal uncertainty score and task difficulty."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed FUD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we will pivot to an analysis paper focusing on the patterns of uncertainty across different scales of reasoning. We'll investigate: (1) How uncertainty propagates from lower to higher levels of abstraction, (2) Whether certain types of reasoning tasks exhibit characteristic uncertainty patterns, (3) The relationship between decomposition depth and overall uncertainty estimates. Additionally, we'll explore alternative aggregation methods for the fractal reconstruction step, such as weighted averages based on the complexity of each sub-component. Finally, we'll conduct a qualitative analysis of the decompositions produced by the model to gain insights into its reasoning process and identify common patterns in uncertainty distribution across different task types."
