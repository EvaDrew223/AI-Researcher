    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, often providing overconfident responses even when the information is ambiguous or incomplete.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly focus on using calibration datasets or fine-tuning models with uncertainty-aware loss functions.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often gain a better understanding of their uncertainty by considering alternative viewpoints or rephrasing a problem. This process of 'mirroring' can help highlight areas of ambiguity or inconsistency.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Amplification via Semantic Mirroring (UASM), a novel prompting technique that leverages the LLM's ability to rephrase and reframe information. Given an initial query, UASM prompts the model to generate multiple semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse reformulations of the question. These reformulations are then used as separate prompts to generate answers. The model is then asked to analyze the consistency and divergence among these answers, explicitly highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. Finally, the model is prompted to synthesize a final answer with a calibrated uncertainty estimate based on this analysis. This method encourages the model to explore the problem space more thoroughly and confront its own inconsistencies, leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UASM against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on a range of tasks including open-ended question answering, fact verification, and reasoning tasks. We will use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, and correlation between expressed uncertainty and actual error rates to assess the effectiveness of our method."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Amplification via Semantic Mirroring: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, providing overconfident responses even when information is ambiguous or incomplete. This leads to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications like healthcare or legal domains.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs primarily rely on calibration datasets or fine-tuning with uncertainty-aware loss functions. However, these approaches often require extensive additional training or domain-specific data. Inspired by human cognitive processes, where considering alternative viewpoints or rephrasing a problem can lead to better uncertainty assessment, we propose a novel prompting technique that leverages the LLM's inherent ability to rephrase and reframe information. This method aims to encourage the model to explore the problem space more thoroughly and confront its own inconsistencies, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification without the need for additional training or external data.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Amplification via Semantic Mirroring (UASM), a prompting technique that consists of four main steps: 1) Initial query processing, 2) Generation of semantically equivalent reformulations, 3) Multi-perspective answer generation, and 4) Consistency analysis and final answer synthesis. Given an initial query, UASM prompts the model to generate multiple semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse reformulations of the question. These reformulations are then used as separate prompts to generate answers. The model is subsequently asked to analyze the consistency and divergence among these answers, explicitly highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. Finally, the model is prompted to synthesize a final answer with a calibrated uncertainty estimate based on this analysis.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate UASM: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, 2) FEVER for fact verification, and 3) BoolQ for yes/no reasoning tasks. These datasets cover a range of task types and have been used in previous uncertainty quantification studies.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Temperature scaling (varying the temperature parameter during inference), and 3) Monte Carlo Dropout (if applicable to the chosen model architecture).",
            "Step 3: UASM Implementation": "Implement the UASM method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial query processing, b) Generation of 3-5 semantically equivalent reformulations, c) Multi-perspective answer generation for each reformulation, d) Consistency analysis across answers, e) Final answer synthesis with uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. If resources allow, we will also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to assess the effectiveness of UASM: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Brier score, 3) Correlation between expressed uncertainty and actual error rates, and 4) Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic curve (AUCE).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results, b) Run UASM method and collect results, c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and UASM results.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform comparative analysis between UASM and baseline methods across different datasets and models. Analyze the impact of the number of reformulations on performance. Investigate cases where UASM significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of UASM: a) Remove the reformulation step, b) Remove the consistency analysis step, c) Vary the number of reformulations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 95%)",
            "UASM Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Query)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "UASM Prompt Output (Step 2: Reformulations)": "1. Which city serves as the political and administrative center of France?\n2. What is the name of the largest city and seat of government in France?\n3. If you were to visit the official residence of the French President, in which city would you find yourself?",
            "UASM Prompt Input (Step 3: Multi-perspective Answers)": "Please answer each of the reformulated questions:",
            "UASM Prompt Output (Step 3: Multi-perspective Answers)": "1. The political and administrative center of France is Paris.\n2. The largest city and seat of government in France is Paris.\n3. If you were to visit the official residence of the French President, you would find yourself in Paris.",
            "UASM Prompt Input (Step 4: Consistency Analysis)": "Analyze the consistency of the answers provided for the reformulated questions. Highlight any areas of agreement or disagreement.",
            "UASM Prompt Output (Step 4: Consistency Analysis)": "The answers to all three reformulated questions consistently indicate that Paris is the capital of France. There is complete agreement across all responses, with no apparent disagreements or inconsistencies.",
            "UASM Prompt Input (Step 5: Final Answer Synthesis)": "Based on the original question, the reformulated questions, their answers, and the consistency analysis, provide a final answer with a calibrated uncertainty estimate.",
            "UASM Prompt Output (Step 5: Final Answer Synthesis)": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 99%)\nExplanation: All reformulated questions and their answers consistently point to Paris as the capital of France. The high level of agreement across multiple perspectives suggests a very high confidence in this answer.",
            "Explanation": "In this example, UASM demonstrates a more thorough exploration of the question through reformulations and multi-perspective answers. The consistency analysis allows for a more nuanced assessment of certainty, potentially leading to a more calibrated confidence estimate compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UASM does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining cases where UASM performs poorly, analyzing the quality and diversity of generated reformulations, and investigating the model's ability to perform consistency analysis. We could also explore alternative approaches within the UASM framework, such as using contrastive questions instead of reformulations, or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the model's responses. Additionally, we might investigate whether UASM is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when and how to apply semantic mirroring techniques for uncertainty quantification."
