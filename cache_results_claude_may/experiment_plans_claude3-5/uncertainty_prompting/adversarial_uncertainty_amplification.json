    "topic_description": "novel prompting methods that can better quantify uncertainty or calibrate the confidence of large language models",
    "idea_name": "Adversarial Uncertainty Amplification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often express overconfidence, particularly in domains where they have incomplete or potentially biased knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mostly focus on improving calibration through training or prompting, but don't actively challenge the model's confidence.",
        "Motivation": "By deliberately introducing doubt and alternative viewpoints, we can push the model to more critically examine its own knowledge and express appropriate uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-agent prompting framework where we instantiate three LLM agents: the main answerer, a devil's advocate, and a moderator. The main answerer provides an initial response and confidence level. The devil's advocate is then prompted to challenge this answer, pointing out potential flaws or alternative viewpoints. The moderator synthesizes these perspectives and prompts the main answerer to revise its confidence. This process can be iterated multiple times. Crucially, the devil's advocate is instructed to be 'uncharitable' in its interpretation, amplifying any possible sources of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on a range of topics, including controversial subjects and cutting-edge scientific questions where uncertainty is high. Compare against single-agent approaches and evaluate not just calibration, but also the quality and depth of uncertainty reasoning provided. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of each agent's role."

        "Title": "Multi-Agent Prompting for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often express overconfidence, particularly in domains where they have incomplete or potentially biased knowledge. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improving calibration in LLMs primarily focus on training or simple prompting techniques, which don't actively challenge the model's confidence. By introducing a multi-agent framework that deliberately introduces doubt and alternative viewpoints, we can push the model to more critically examine its own knowledge and express appropriate uncertainty. This approach leverages the LLM's own capabilities to generate more nuanced and well-calibrated responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-agent prompting framework with three LLM agents: the main answerer, a devil's advocate, and a moderator. The process works as follows: 1) The main answerer provides an initial response and confidence level. 2) The devil's advocate challenges this answer, pointing out potential flaws or alternative viewpoints. 3) The moderator synthesizes these perspectives and prompts the main answerer to revise its confidence. This process can be iterated multiple times. Crucially, the devil's advocate is instructed to be 'uncharitable' in its interpretation, amplifying any possible sources of uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse dataset that includes: a) Controversial subjects from fields like politics, ethics, and social issues. b) Cutting-edge scientific questions where uncertainty is high. c) General knowledge questions with varying degrees of difficulty and certainty. Use existing datasets like TruthfulQA, MMLU, and AI2 Reasoning Challenge, supplemented with manually curated questions for specific domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the question. b) Single-agent confidence prompting: Ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Ask the model to think step-by-step before answering.",
            "Step 3: Multi-Agent Framework Implementation": "Implement the proposed multi-agent framework: a) Main Answerer: Prompt with 'Provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100%) for the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Devil's Advocate: Prompt with 'Challenge the following answer, pointing out potential flaws, uncertainties, or alternative viewpoints: [PREVIOUS_ANSWER]' c) Moderator: Prompt with 'Synthesize the following perspectives and suggest a revised confidence score: [MAIN_ANSWER] [DEVIL'S_ADVOCATE_CHALLENGE]' d) Iteration: Prompt the Main Answerer again with 'Given the challenge and synthesis, provide a revised answer and confidence score.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all agents. Optionally, include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Run all baseline methods. b) Run the multi-agent framework for 1, 2, and 3 iterations. c) Record all intermediate outputs, final answers, and confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "a) Quantitative: Compare calibration using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score. b) Qualitative: Manually assess a subset of responses for the quality and depth of uncertainty reasoning. c) Ablation study: Run experiments removing each agent to assess their individual impact.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare performance across different question types and domains. b) Analyze how confidence scores change across iterations. c) Identify patterns in the types of challenges raised by the devil's advocate. d) Assess the moderator's effectiveness in synthesizing perspectives."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the current scientific consensus on the existence of dark matter?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The current scientific consensus strongly supports the existence of dark matter. Numerous observations, including galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background, provide compelling evidence for its presence. While we haven't directly detected dark matter particles, most astrophysicists believe it constitutes about 85% of the matter in the universe.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Main Answerer)": "Provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100%) for the following question: What is the current scientific consensus on the existence of dark matter?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Main Answerer)": "Answer: The current scientific consensus strongly supports the existence of dark matter. Multiple lines of evidence, including galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing effects, and observations of the cosmic microwave background, suggest that dark matter makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe. While dark matter particles have not been directly detected, the majority of astrophysicists accept dark matter as the best explanation for various observed phenomena in the universe. Confidence: 90%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Devil's Advocate)": "Challenge the following answer, pointing out potential flaws, uncertainties, or alternative viewpoints: [PREVIOUS_ANSWER]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Devil's Advocate)": "Challenge: While there is significant evidence supporting the existence of dark matter, there are several points of uncertainty and alternative viewpoints to consider: 1) Direct detection: Despite numerous experiments, we have yet to directly detect dark matter particles, which raises questions about its nature and existence. 2) Alternative theories: Some physicists propose modified gravity theories (e.g., MOND) that could explain observed phenomena without the need for dark matter. 3) Bias in the scientific community: The widespread acceptance of dark matter could potentially lead to confirmation bias in interpreting new data. 4) Limitations of current models: Our understanding of dark matter is based on models that may not fully capture the complexity of the universe. 5) Ongoing debates: There are still active debates about the properties and distribution of dark matter, indicating that our understanding is far from complete.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Moderator)": "Synthesize the following perspectives and suggest a revised confidence score: [MAIN_ANSWER] [DEVIL'S_ADVOCATE_CHALLENGE]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Moderator)": "Synthesis: The existence of dark matter is supported by multiple lines of observational evidence and is widely accepted in the astrophysics community. However, there are important caveats and uncertainties to consider: 1) The lack of direct detection of dark matter particles remains a significant challenge. 2) Alternative theories, while not as widely accepted, do exist and cannot be entirely dismissed. 3) The potential for bias in the scientific community and limitations in our current models should be acknowledged. Given these considerations, while the evidence for dark matter is strong, there is still room for uncertainty and ongoing research. Suggested revised confidence score: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Main Answerer, Iteration 2)": "Given the challenge and synthesis, provide a revised answer and confidence score for the question: What is the current scientific consensus on the existence of dark matter?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Main Answerer, Iteration 2)": "Revised Answer: The current scientific consensus generally supports the existence of dark matter, but with important caveats and ongoing areas of research. Most astrophysicists accept dark matter as the best explanation for various observed phenomena, including galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background. These observations suggest that dark matter constitutes about 85% of the matter in the universe. However, it's important to note that: 1) Dark matter particles have not been directly detected despite numerous experiments. 2) Alternative theories, such as modified gravity, exist and are still being explored. 3) There are ongoing debates about the properties and distribution of dark matter. 4) Our understanding is based on models that may have limitations. While the evidence for dark matter is compelling, the scientific community acknowledges the need for continued research and remains open to new findings that could alter our understanding. Revised Confidence: 80%"
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-agent prompting method doesn't significantly improve calibration or uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of the intermediate outputs from each agent to understand where the method falls short. This could provide insights into the LLM's reasoning process and limitations in expressing uncertainty. 2) Experiment with different prompting strategies for each agent, such as using more structured prompts or incorporating external knowledge sources. 3) Investigate the impact of different iteration counts and analyze how uncertainty changes over iterations. 4) Compare the performance across different types of questions to identify patterns in where the method succeeds or fails. 5) Explore combining our method with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods. 6) If the method shows promise in certain areas but not others, we could focus on developing a hybrid approach that selectively applies different uncertainty quantification methods based on the question type or domain."
