        "Title": "Iterative Hypothetical Outcome Prompting for Improved Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence, especially in scenarios where multiple plausible outcomes exist. This can lead to overconfident predictions on uncertain or ambiguous tasks, potentially misleading users or downstream applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for confidence estimation in LLMs often rely on single-pass confidence scoring or simple averaging of multiple outputs, which may not capture the full range of possible outcomes or their implications. By exploring hypothetical outcomes and their implications iteratively, we can potentially refine confidence estimates in a way that more closely mimics human reasoning processes. This approach could lead to more nuanced and accurate confidence calibration, improving the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting process called Iterative Hypothetical Outcome Prompting (IHOP):\n1. Generate an initial answer and confidence score.\n2. Prompt the model to generate n alternative hypothetical outcomes.\n3. For each hypothetical outcome, analyze its implications and how it might change the initial confidence.\n4. Aggregate the analyses to refine the confidence score.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for m iterations or until confidence stabilizes.\nThis method encourages the model to consider a broader range of possibilities and their implications, potentially leading to more nuanced and accurate confidence estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select multiple-choice QA datasets with varying degrees of ambiguity. We will use:\n1. TriviaQA: A large-scale dataset with questions from trivia and quiz-league websites.\n2. AmbigQA: A dataset specifically designed to have multiple valid answers to questions.\n3. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A dataset covering 57 tasks including mathematics, history, law, and more.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the question and get the answer with confidence.\n2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use 'Let's approach this step by step' before the question.\n3. Multiple sampling: Generate multiple answers and average the confidences.",
            "Step 4: IHOP Implementation": "Implement the IHOP method with the following steps:\n1. Initial answer generation: 'Given the question \"{question}\", provide an answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.'\n2. Hypothetical outcome generation: 'Generate {n} alternative plausible answers to the question \"{question}\".'\n3. Implication analysis: 'For each alternative answer, analyze how it might affect the initial confidence score.'\n4. Confidence refinement: 'Based on the initial answer and the analyses of alternatives, provide a refined confidence score between 0 and 1.'\n5. Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 for {m} iterations or until the confidence score stabilizes (changes less than 0.05).",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method:\n1. Process all questions through the model.\n2. Record answers, confidence scores, and intermediate steps for IHOP.\n3. For IHOP, experiment with different values of n (number of alternatives) and m (number of iterations). Try n = [3, 5, 7] and m = [2, 3, 4].",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics:\n1. Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers.\n2. Calibration error: Difference between confidence and accuracy.\n3. Brier score: Measures both calibration and resolution of probabilistic predictions.\n4. ECE (Expected Calibration Error): Measures the difference in expectation between confidence and accuracy.\n5. MCE (Maximum Calibration Error): The maximum gap between confidence and accuracy.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare IHOP against baselines across all metrics.\n2. Analyze how n and m affect performance.\n3. Examine cases where IHOP significantly improves or worsens calibration.\n4. Analyze the content of generated alternative hypotheses and their impact on final confidence.\n5. Investigate how performance varies across different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. ambiguous)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who wrote the play 'Hamlet'?\nA: William Shakespeare\nConfidence: 0.95",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who wrote the play 'Hamlet'?\nA: William Shakespeare\nConfidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IHOP; Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Given the question \"Who wrote the play 'Hamlet'?\", provide an answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IHOP; Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Answer: William Shakespeare\nConfidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IHOP; Step 2: Generate Alternatives)": "Generate 3 alternative plausible answers to the question \"Who wrote the play 'Hamlet'?\"",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IHOP; Step 2: Generate Alternatives)": "1. Christopher Marlowe\n2. Francis Bacon\n3. Edward de Vere",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IHOP; Step 3: Analyze Implications)": "For each alternative answer, analyze how it might affect the initial confidence score of 0.95 for William Shakespeare as the author of 'Hamlet'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IHOP; Step 3: Analyze Implications)": "1. Christopher Marlowe: This could slightly decrease confidence. Some scholars have proposed Marlowe as a potential author, though this theory is not widely accepted. It might reduce confidence to 0.92.\n2. Francis Bacon: This alternative has less support than Marlowe, but the existence of the theory might further decrease confidence slightly to 0.90.\n3. Edward de Vere: The Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship proposes de Vere as the true author. While not mainstream, this theory has gained some traction and could decrease confidence to 0.88.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IHOP; Step 4: Refine Confidence)": "Based on the initial answer of William Shakespeare with 0.95 confidence and the analyses of alternatives, provide a refined confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IHOP; Step 4: Refine Confidence)": "Refined confidence: 0.88",
            "Explanation": "The IHOP method allows the model to consider alternative hypotheses and their implications, leading to a more nuanced confidence estimate. In this case, the existence of alternative authorship theories, while not widely accepted, does introduce some uncertainty, resulting in a slightly lower but potentially more accurate confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IHOP method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the generated alternative hypotheses to understand what types of alternatives the model considers and how this varies across question types. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential biases.\n2. Investigate how the number and diversity of alternative hypotheses correlate with question difficulty or ambiguity. This could lead to a method for automatically identifying challenging or ambiguous questions.\n3. Explore using the alternative hypotheses generation as a form of data augmentation for fine-tuning models on confidence calibration tasks.\n4. Develop a hybrid method that combines IHOP with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods.\n5. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to categorize the types of questions where IHOP performs well or poorly, which could inform future research directions in confidence calibration for LLMs."
