        "Problem": "Language models often fail to recognize when they've drifted off-topic or are generating increasingly irrelevant content.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on static confidence estimation or rely on external coherence measures.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to continuously assess its own semantic relevance, we can better quantify uncertainty in long-form generation tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Drift Uncertainty Estimation (SDUE), a dynamic prompting method for long-form generation. As the model generates content, it is periodically prompted to assess its semantic relevance to the original topic or question. The prompt might include: 'Reread what you've written so far. On a scale of 1-10, how relevant is this to the original prompt? Explain your rating.' If the relevance score drops below a threshold, the model is instructed to express uncertainty and potentially redirect its generation. This method allows for real-time uncertainty quantification during the generation process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SDUE against standard generation techniques on long-form writing tasks. Evaluate using human judgments of relevance and coherence, as well as automatic semantic similarity metrics."

        "Title": "Semantic Drift Uncertainty Estimation: Dynamic Prompting for Improved Confidence Calibration in Long-Form Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Language models often fail to recognize when they've drifted off-topic or are generating increasingly irrelevant content during long-form generation tasks. This can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant outputs, especially in extended text generation scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on static confidence estimation or rely on external coherence measures, which may not capture the dynamic nature of semantic relevance in long-form generation. By prompting the model to continuously assess its own semantic relevance, we can better quantify uncertainty and improve the quality of generated content. This method leverages the model's own understanding of relevance and coherence, potentially leading to more accurate and context-aware uncertainty estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Drift Uncertainty Estimation (SDUE), a dynamic prompting method for long-form generation. As the model generates content, it is periodically prompted to assess its semantic relevance to the original topic or question. The prompt includes: 'Reread what you've written so far.

This method allows for real-time uncertainty quantification during the generation process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse set of long-form generation tasks, including open-ended questions, article writing, and story continuation. Use datasets such as WritingPrompts for creative writing tasks and Wikipedia article introductions for factual writing tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard generation techniques as baselines: (a) Standard generation without any intervention, (b) Generation with a static confidence threshold, (c) Generation with external coherence measures (e.g., using pre-trained sentence embeddings to measure similarity).",
            "Step 3: SDUE Implementation": "Implement the SDUE method: (a) Generate content in chunks (e.g., 100 tokens at a time), (b) After each chunk, prompt the model to assess relevance, (c) If relevance score is below threshold (e.g., 7/10), prompt the model to express uncertainty and redirect, (d) Continue generation until completion or a maximum token limit.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Setup": "For each task in the dataset: (a) Generate outputs using baseline methods and SDUE, (b) Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo as the main models for generation, (c) Vary the frequency of relevance checks (every 50, 100, 200 tokens) to analyze impact.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate outputs using: (a) Human judgments of relevance and coherence (use crowdsourcing platforms), (b) Automatic semantic similarity metrics (e.g., BERTScore, BLEURT), (c) Measure of uncertainty (frequency and distribution of expressed uncertainties), (d) Task-specific metrics (e.g., factual accuracy for Wikipedia-style writing).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Analyze results to compare SDUE against baselines: (a) Overall quality and relevance of generated content, (b) Effectiveness in detecting and correcting semantic drift, (c) Impact of relevance check frequency on performance, (d) Correlation between model's self-reported relevance scores and human judgments."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Write a short article about the history of coffee.",
                "Output": "Coffee has a rich and fascinating history that spans centuries and continents. Originating in Ethiopia, legend has it that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered coffee when he noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating certain berries. From there, coffee spread to the Arabian Peninsula, where it was cultivated and traded. By the 16th century, coffee had reached Europe and quickly gained popularity. The first coffeehouses opened in Venice in 1645, becoming centers of social interaction and intellectual discourse. As European nations established colonies, coffee cultivation spread to new regions, including the Americas and Asia. Today, coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages, with millions of people enjoying it daily. The coffee industry has evolved significantly, with the rise of specialty coffee, fair trade practices, and innovative brewing methods. Coffee has also played a role in social and political movements, from the Boston Tea Party to modern-day cafe culture. Interestingly, the coffee plant is related to the gardenia flower, sharing the same family of plants. Both coffee and gardenias prefer similar growing conditions, thriving in warm, humid environments with well-draining soil. Gardenias are known for their fragrant white flowers, which have a sweet, intoxicating scent. Some gardeners even use coffee grounds as a natural fertilizer for their gardenia plants, as the acidity in coffee can help maintain the soil pH that gardenias prefer.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method generates coherent content initially but begins to drift off-topic towards the end, discussing gardenias which are not directly related to the history of coffee."

            "SDUE Example": {
                "Input": "Write a short article about the history of coffee.",
                "Step 1 Output": "Coffee has a rich and fascinating history that spans centuries and continents. Originating in Ethiopia, legend has it that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered coffee when he noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating certain berries. From there, coffee spread to the Arabian Peninsula, where it was cultivated and traded. By the 16th century, coffee had reached Europe and quickly gained popularity.",
                "Step 1 Relevance Check": "Relevance score: 10/10. This content is highly relevant to the history of coffee, covering its origins, early spread, and introduction to Europe.",
                "Step 2 Output": "The first coffeehouses opened in Venice in 1645, becoming centers of social interaction and intellectual discourse. As European nations established colonies, coffee cultivation spread to new regions, including the Americas and Asia. Today, coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages, with millions of people enjoying it daily.",
                "Step 2 Relevance Check": "Relevance score: 9/10. This content continues to be relevant, discussing the spread of coffee culture and its global impact. The last sentence slightly shifts towards modern consumption but is still connected to the historical context.",
                "Step 3 Output": "The coffee industry has evolved significantly, with the rise of specialty coffee, fair trade practices, and innovative brewing methods. Coffee has also played a role in social and political movements, from the Boston Tea Party to modern-day cafe culture.",
                "Step 3 Relevance Check": "Relevance score: 7/10. While this content is still related to coffee, it's starting to drift from the main focus on history. The mention of modern practices and social movements is less directly tied to the historical narrative.",
                "Final Output": "I apologize, but I realize I'm starting to drift from the main topic of coffee history. Let me refocus on the historical aspects. In the 18th and 19th centuries, coffee became an important commodity in global trade. Colonial powers established large-scale coffee plantations in their territories, leading to significant economic and social changes in coffee-growing regions. The invention of various brewing methods, such as the French press in the 1850s and the espresso machine in 1901, further shaped coffee culture and consumption patterns throughout history.",
                "Explanation": "The SDUE method allows the model to recognize when it's starting to drift off-topic and redirect itself back to the main focus on coffee history. This results in a more coherent and relevant article compared to the baseline example."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SDUE method doesn't significantly improve over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of where and why the method fails, examining the relationship between the model's self-reported relevance scores and actual content drift. This could provide insights into the model's self-awareness and limitations in assessing its own output. Second, we could explore variations of the SDUE method, such as using different prompting strategies for relevance assessment or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide the model back on topic. Third, we could investigate the impact of SDUE on different types of writing tasks, potentially uncovering task-specific patterns in semantic drift. Lastly, we could shift focus to analyzing how different models (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4) perform in self-assessment tasks, which could provide valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of different language models in meta-cognitive tasks."
