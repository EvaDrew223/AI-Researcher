        "Problem": "LLMs often provide global confidence estimates that fail to capture varying levels of uncertainty for different semantic components within a response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on token-level or overall response uncertainty, missing semantic-level granularity.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing responses into semantic units and assessing uncertainty for each component, we can provide more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Decomposition Uncertainty Mapping (SDUM): 1) Prompt the model to break down its response into core semantic components or claims. 2) For each component, prompt the model to provide a confidence estimate and identify key factors influencing its certainty. 3) Guide the model to analyze relationships between components, identifying how uncertainty in one area affects others. 4) Finally, prompt the model to reconstruct a response with component-level uncertainty estimates integrated. Each step is explicitly included in the prompting strategy.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SDUM on tasks requiring complex, multi-faceted responses, such as open-ended question answering or analytical writing. Compare against global and token-level uncertainty methods using metrics like semantic-level calibration and human evaluation of uncertainty granularity and interpretability."

        "Title": "Semantic Decomposition Uncertainty Mapping: Enhancing Granular Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide global confidence estimates that fail to capture varying levels of uncertainty for different semantic components within a response. This lack of granularity in uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs, especially in complex, multi-faceted tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on token-level or overall response uncertainty, missing semantic-level granularity. By decomposing responses into semantic units and assessing uncertainty for each component, we can provide more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification. This method leverages the LLM's own capabilities to analyze and refine its outputs, potentially leading to more reliable and transparent AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Decomposition Uncertainty Mapping (SDUM), a multi-step prompting strategy: 1) Prompt the model to break down its response into core semantic components or claims. 2) For each component, prompt the model to provide a confidence estimate and identify key factors influencing its certainty. 3) Guide the model to analyze relationships between components, identifying how uncertainty in one area affects others. 4) Finally, prompt the model to reconstruct a response with component-level uncertainty estimates integrated.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that require complex, multi-faceted responses. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, b) FEVER for fact verification, and c) SummEval for text summarization.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Global Uncertainty: Use temperature scaling to get a single confidence score for the entire response. 2) Token-level Uncertainty: Use methods like Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate per-token uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SDUM Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of SDUM: a) Semantic Decomposition: 'Break down your response into distinct semantic components or claims.' b) Component Confidence: 'For each component, provide a confidence score (0-100) and explain factors influencing your certainty.' c) Inter-component Analysis: 'Analyze how uncertainty in one component might affect others.' d) Reconstruction: 'Reconstruct your response, integrating uncertainty estimates for each component.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Semantic-level Calibration: Compare model's confidence with human-annotated correctness for each semantic component. b) Uncertainty Granularity: Measure the variance in uncertainty scores across components. c) Human Evaluation: Assess the interpretability and usefulness of SDUM outputs compared to baselines.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Generate responses using baseline methods and SDUM. b) Calculate evaluation metrics. c) Perform statistical analysis to compare SDUM with baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of results, focusing on: a) Performance differences across tasks and models. b) Correlation between semantic decomposition quality and overall performance. c) Effectiveness of inter-component uncertainty analysis."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "What are the potential impacts of increasing global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius?",
                "Output (Global Uncertainty)": "Increasing global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius could lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, rising sea levels threatening coastal areas, changes in precipitation patterns affecting agriculture, and loss of biodiversity. It may also cause more extreme weather events and disrupt ecosystems worldwide. Overall confidence: 85%",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence score for the entire response, lacking granularity in uncertainty quantification."
            },
            "SDUM Example": {
                "Input": "What are the potential impacts of increasing global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius?",
                "Output": "Semantic Components:\n1. More frequent and severe heatwaves (Confidence: 95%)\nFactors: Robust climate models, observed trends\n2. Rising sea levels threatening coastal areas (Confidence: 90%)\nFactors: Current sea level rise measurements, thermal expansion projections\n3. Changes in precipitation patterns affecting agriculture (Confidence: 80%)\nFactors: Climate model variability, complex local factors\n4. Loss of biodiversity (Confidence: 85%)\nFactors: Observed species migrations, ecosystem vulnerabilities\n5. More extreme weather events (Confidence: 75%)\nFactors: Complex atmospheric dynamics, regional variations\n6. Disruption of ecosystems worldwide (Confidence: 70%)\nFactors: Interconnected nature of ecosystems, adaptation uncertainties\n\nInter-component Analysis:\nUncertainty in precipitation patterns (3) affects confidence in agricultural impacts and ecosystem disruptions (6). Uncertainty in extreme weather events (5) influences confidence in biodiversity loss predictions (4).\n\nReconstructed Response:\nIncreasing global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius is highly likely (95% confidence) to cause more frequent and severe heatwaves. Sea levels are expected to rise, threatening coastal areas (90% confidence). With somewhat less certainty (80% confidence), we anticipate changes in precipitation patterns affecting agriculture. Biodiversity loss is a significant concern (85% confidence), though the full extent of ecosystem disruptions is less certain (70% confidence). While more extreme weather events are expected (75% confidence), their precise nature and frequency remain less predictable.",
                "Explanation": "SDUM provides granular uncertainty estimates for each semantic component, explains factors influencing certainty, and analyzes inter-component relationships. This approach offers a more nuanced and interpretable uncertainty quantification."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SDUM does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining cases where SDUM performs poorly, assessing the quality of semantic decompositions, and analyzing the relationship between component-level and global uncertainties. We could also explore variations of SDUM, such as using different prompting strategies for decomposition or confidence estimation. Additionally, we might investigate how SDUM performs on different types of tasks or with different model sizes to identify scenarios where it is most effective. If the method still doesn't yield improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on why semantic decomposition doesn't improve uncertainty estimation and what this reveals about LLMs' understanding of their own knowledge limitations."
