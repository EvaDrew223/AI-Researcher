        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid interpretations or solution paths may exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence estimation or ensemble methods, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties in multi-step reasoning processes.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by decision tree algorithms and recursive problem-solving strategies, we propose a method that systematically explores and quantifies uncertainties at each decision point in a reasoning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Bifurcation (RCB), a prompting technique that guides the model to recursively split its reasoning process into binary decisions, assigning confidence scores at each split. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Identify the next critical decision point in the reasoning process. 2) Formulate two mutually exclusive options. 3) Assign confidence scores to each option, ensuring they sum to 100%. 4) Recursively apply steps 1-3 to the chosen path until reaching a final answer. 5) Aggregate confidence scores along the chosen path to produce a final confidence estimate. This approach creates a tree-like structure of confidence estimates, allowing for fine-grained uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RCB against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on multi-step reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving and logical deduction. Evaluate using metrics like calibration error, Brier score, and decision tree-inspired metrics like uncertainty depth and breadth."

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Bifurcation: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Structured Decision Trees",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid interpretations or solution paths may exist. This issue is especially pronounced in multi-step reasoning processes, where uncertainties can compound and lead to unreliable confidence estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence estimation or ensemble methods, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties in multi-step reasoning processes. Inspired by decision tree algorithms and recursive problem-solving strategies, we propose a method that systematically explores and quantifies uncertainties at each decision point in a reasoning process. This approach allows for a more fine-grained and interpretable uncertainty quantification, potentially leading to more reliable and explainable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Confidence Bifurcation (RCB), a prompting technique that guides the model to recursively split its reasoning process into binary decisions, assigning confidence scores at each split. The process involves the following steps: 1) Identify the next critical decision point in the reasoning process. 2) Formulate two mutually exclusive options. 3) Assign confidence scores to each option, ensuring they sum to 100%. 4) Recursively apply steps 1-3 to the chosen path until reaching a final answer. 5) Aggregate confidence scores along the chosen path to produce a final confidence estimate. This approach creates a tree-like structure of confidence estimates, allowing for fine-grained uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving, 2) CLUTRR for logical reasoning, and 3) StrategyQA for strategic reasoning. These datasets cover a range of multi-step reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with confidence estimation, and 3) Ensemble method using multiple model runs.",
            "Step 3: RCB Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Confidence Bifurcation method. Create prompts that guide the model through the RCB process, including decision point identification, option formulation, and confidence assignment.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and RCB. For each problem, we will generate: 1) The final answer, 2) The confidence score, and 3) The full reasoning tree for RCB.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the results using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy of final answers, 2) Calibration error (comparing confidence scores to actual accuracy), 3) Brier score, 4) Decision tree metrics (average depth and breadth of reasoning trees), and 5) Qualitative analysis of reasoning trees.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare RCB performance against baselines. Analyze how RCB affects confidence estimation and decision-making process. Investigate correlations between tree structure and task difficulty or model performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels at 60 miles per hour, how many miles will it cover in 2.5 hours? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer as a percentage.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Answer: The train will cover 150 miles in 2.5 hours. Calculation: 60 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 150 miles. Confidence: 95%",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels at 60 miles per hour, how many miles will it cover in 2.5 hours? Please think through this step-by-step, provide your answer, and your confidence in the answer as a percentage.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. We know the train's speed: 60 miles per hour\n2. We know the duration of travel: 2.5 hours\n3. To find the distance, we multiply speed by time\n4. 60 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 150 miles\n\nTherefore, the train will cover 150 miles in 2.5 hours.\n\nConfidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCB Prompting)": "Q: If a train travels at 60 miles per hour, how many miles will it cover in 2.5 hours? Please use the Recursive Confidence Bifurcation method to solve this problem. At each step, identify the next decision point, provide two options, assign confidence to each option, and continue with the higher confidence option until you reach a final answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCB Prompting)": "Decision Point 1: What is the correct formula to use?\nOption A: Distance = Speed * Time (90% confidence)\nOption B: Distance = Speed / Time (10% confidence)\nChosen: Option A\n\nDecision Point 2: How to handle the fractional hour?\nOption A: Convert 2.5 hours to 150 minutes (40% confidence)\nOption B: Use 2.5 directly in the calculation (60% confidence)\nChosen: Option B\n\nDecision Point 3: What is the correct calculation?\nOption A: 60 * 2.5 = 150 miles (95% confidence)\nOption B: 60 * 2.5 = 140 miles (5% confidence)\nChosen: Option A\n\nFinal Answer: The train will cover 150 miles in 2.5 hours.\nOverall Confidence: 90% * 60% * 95% = 51.3%",
            "explanation": "The RCB method provides a more detailed breakdown of the decision-making process, allowing for identification of specific points of uncertainty. While the baseline methods give a single confidence score, RCB shows how confidence evolves through each step of reasoning, potentially leading to a more nuanced and accurate assessment of overall confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the RCB method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine: 1) The quality and relevance of decision points identified by the model, 2) The model's ability to generate meaningful bifurcations at each decision point, 3) The accuracy of confidence assignments at each step. This analysis could lead to insights about the model's reasoning process and potential improvements to the RCB method. Additionally, we could explore combining RCB with other techniques, such as using it as a component in an ensemble method, or incorporating external knowledge sources at decision points to guide the bifurcation process. If these approaches don't yield improvements, we could shift our focus to analyzing how different types of reasoning tasks affect the structure of decision trees produced by RCB, potentially uncovering patterns that could inform future work on interpretable AI and reasoning strategies in LLMs."
