    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods often fail to capture the hierarchical and multi-scale nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically provide a single, global uncertainty estimate or a flat distribution over possible outcomes.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by fractal geometry, where patterns repeat at different scales, we can conceptualize uncertainty in language models as having a similar self-similar, multi-scale structure.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Confidence Decomposition (FCD), a recursive prompting technique that elicits uncertainty estimates at multiple levels of granularity. The process begins with a high-level question and progressively breaks it down into sub-questions, creating a tree-like structure of uncertainties. At each level, the model is prompted to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The prompt might look like: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100). Then, identify 3 sub-questions that would help answer the main question. Repeat this process for each sub-question, going 3 levels deep. Format your response as a nested list.' This fractal approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of where uncertainty originates in the reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate FCD against flat uncertainty estimation techniques on complex reasoning tasks such as multi-hop question answering, logical deduction, and causal inference problems. Develop new metrics to assess the quality of hierarchical uncertainty estimates, such as a 'fractal uncertainty score' that considers the distribution and coherence of uncertainties across different levels."

        "Title": "Fractal Confidence Decomposition: A Multi-Scale Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for large language models often fail to capture the hierarchical and multi-scale nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. This limitation leads to oversimplified uncertainty estimates that do not accurately reflect the nuanced structure of uncertainty in multi-step reasoning processes.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically provide a single, global uncertainty estimate or a flat distribution over possible outcomes. This oversimplification fails to capture the intricate nature of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by fractal geometry, where patterns repeat at different scales, we conceptualize uncertainty in language models as having a similar self-similar, multi-scale structure. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of where uncertainty originates in the reasoning process and how it propagates through different levels of abstraction.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Fractal Confidence Decomposition (FCD), a recursive prompting technique that elicits uncertainty estimates at multiple levels of granularity. The process begins with a high-level question and progressively breaks it down into sub-questions, creating a tree-like structure of uncertainties. At each level, the model is prompted to provide both an answer and a confidence estimate. The prompt structure is as follows: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100). Then, identify 3 sub-questions that would help answer the main question. Repeat this process for each sub-question, going 3 levels deep. Format your response as a nested list.' This fractal approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of uncertainty distribution across different reasoning steps.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve complex reasoning: (1) Multi-hop question answering: HotpotQA, (2) Logical deduction: LogiQA, (3) Causal inference: COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives). For each dataset, randomly select 100 questions for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct uncertainty estimation: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide a single confidence score. (2) Flat decomposition: Break down the question into sub-questions, but only one level deep, and get confidence scores for each.",
            "Step 3: Fractal Confidence Decomposition Implementation": "Implement the FCD method using the following prompt structure: 'Q: [Main Question] A: Provide your answer here. Confidence: [0-100] Sub-questions: 1. [Sub-question 1] A: Answer. Confidence: [0-100] Sub-sub-questions: a. [Sub-sub-question 1a] A: Answer. Confidence: [0-100] b. [Sub-sub-question 1b] A: Answer. Confidence: [0-100] c. [Sub-sub-question 1c] A: Answer. Confidence: [0-100] 2. [Sub-question 2] ... 3. [Sub-question 3] ...' Repeat this structure for each sub-question, going three levels deep.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection and API Setup": "Use GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments. Set up the API client and ensure proper error handling and rate limiting.",
            "Step 5: Data Collection": "For each question in the datasets, collect responses using all three methods (direct, flat decomposition, and FCD). Store the full response trees, including all sub-questions, answers, and confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Metrics Implementation": "Implement the following metrics: (1) Accuracy: Correctness of the final answer. (2) Calibration error: Difference between confidence and accuracy. (3) Fractal Uncertainty Score (FUS): A new metric that considers the distribution and coherence of uncertainties across different levels. Calculate as the weighted average of confidence scores, with weights decreasing exponentially with depth.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Visualization": "Compute all metrics for each method. Create visualizations including: (1) Comparison bar charts of accuracy and calibration error across methods. (2) Heatmaps of confidence scores at different levels for FCD. (3) Scatter plots of FUS vs. accuracy to analyze the relationship between fractal uncertainty and performance.",
            "Step 8: Statistical Tests": "Perform paired t-tests to compare the performance of FCD against baselines in terms of accuracy, calibration error, and FUS.",
            "Step 9: Qualitative Analysis": "Manually inspect a subset of responses to identify patterns in how uncertainty propagates through the reasoning process and how it relates to answer correctness.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the depth of decomposition (1 to 4 levels) and the number of sub-questions per level (2 to 4) to analyze their impact on performance and uncertainty estimation."

Were there controversies surrounding the publication of 'Go Set a Watchman'? A: Yes, there were debates about whether Lee truly wanted the book published and questions about its discovery. Confidence: 85",
            "explanation": "The FCD method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence across different aspects of the question. It reveals areas of high confidence (e.g., the author's name) and lower confidence (e.g., reasons for the publication gap). This granular uncertainty information can be more informative than a single confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed FCD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the patterns of uncertainty propagation through the question decomposition tree to gain insights into the model's reasoning process. This could involve creating visualizations of how uncertainty changes at different levels and identifying common patterns. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or reasoning tasks benefit more from FCD than others. This could lead to a taxonomy of reasoning tasks based on their uncertainty structures. 3) Explore how the FCD outputs could be used to improve the model's final answer or to generate better explanations. For example, we could implement a 'confidence-weighted answer synthesis' step that combines information from different levels of the decomposition based on their confidence scores. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where FCD performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines, which could provide insights into the strengths and limitations of the approach and suggest improvements. 5) Investigate how FCD outputs correlate with human judgments of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks, which could provide valuable insights into AI alignment and interpretability."
