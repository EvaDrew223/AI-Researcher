        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for time-dependent queries or in scenarios where information may change over time.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on static uncertainty estimation and do not account for temporal dynamics in knowledge or query relevance.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly modeling how uncertainty might change over time, we can provide more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates for time-sensitive queries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Divergence Prompting (TDP), which asks the LLM to generate responses and uncertainty estimates for a query at multiple time points in the future. The prompt might be structured as: 'Provide an answer and confidence level for the question \"Who will be the US President?\" at the following time points: now, 1 year from now, 5 years from now, and 10 years from now.' The model generates responses for each time point, along with confidence levels. We then analyze the divergence in responses and confidence levels over time to compute a dynamic uncertainty score that captures both current uncertainty and potential future changes.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TDP on a dataset of time-sensitive questions, comparing it to static uncertainty estimation methods. Measure performance using metrics like time-weighted calibration error and temporal consistency of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Temporal Divergence Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification for Time-Dependent Queries in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty for time-dependent queries or in scenarios where information may change over time. Current approaches typically focus on static uncertainty estimation and do not account for temporal dynamics in knowledge or query relevance. This limitation can lead to overconfident or misleading predictions for time-sensitive questions.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are primarily designed for static scenarios and fail to capture the temporal aspect of knowledge uncertainty. By explicitly modeling how uncertainty might change over time, we can provide more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates for time-sensitive queries. This approach is inspired by the human cognitive ability to reason about future uncertainties and how our confidence in predictions may change over time. Temporal Divergence Prompting (TDP) aims to leverage the LLM's ability to generate responses for different time points and analyze the divergence in these responses to compute a dynamic uncertainty score.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Divergence Prompting (TDP), which asks the LLM to generate responses and uncertainty estimates for a query at multiple time points in the future. The process involves the following steps: 1) Construct a prompt that asks the LLM to provide answers and confidence levels for a given query at multiple future time points. 2) Generate responses for each time point. 3) Analyze the divergence in responses and confidence levels over time. 4) Compute a dynamic uncertainty score that captures both current uncertainty and potential future changes. The prompt structure will be: 'Provide an answer and confidence level (0-100%) for the question \"[QUERY]\" at the following time points: now, 1 year from now, 5 years from now, and 10 years from now.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of time-sensitive questions across various domains (e.g., politics, technology, science, economics). Include a mix of short-term and long-term predictions. Collect ground truth answers and uncertainty levels for each question at different time points when possible.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement static uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting with confidence estimation. b) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using multiple LLM samples. c) Calibrated confidence scores using temperature scaling.",
            "Step 3: TDP Implementation": "Implement the Temporal Divergence Prompting method: a) Construct prompts for each question in the dataset, asking for answers and confidence levels at multiple time points. b) Generate responses using the chosen LLM(s). c) Implement divergence analysis to compute dynamic uncertainty scores.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API as the primary models for evaluation. Additionally, test the method on open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Time-weighted calibration error: Measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy across different time points. b) Temporal consistency: Assess the coherence of predictions across time points. c) Dynamic uncertainty score accuracy: Compare the computed dynamic uncertainty scores with human-annotated uncertainty levels when available.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply baseline methods and record results. b) Apply TDP method and record results. c) Compute evaluation metrics for both baseline and TDP methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare TDP performance against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze how uncertainty estimates change over time for different types of questions. c) Investigate cases where TDP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: a) Vary the number and distribution of time points in the prompt. b) Experiment with different divergence analysis methods. c) Test the impact of using different LLMs or model sizes."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What will be the global average temperature increase by 2030 compared to pre-industrial levels? Provide your answer and a confidence level from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The global average temperature increase by 2030 compared to pre-industrial levels is likely to be around 1.5\u00b0C. Confidence level: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Provide an answer and confidence level (0-100%) for the question \"What will be the global average temperature increase compared to pre-industrial levels?\" at the following time points: now, 1 year from now, 5 years from now, and 10 years from now.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Now: The current global average temperature increase compared to pre-industrial levels is approximately 1.1\u00b0C. Confidence level: 90%\n\n1 year from now: The global average temperature increase is estimated to be about 1.2\u00b0C. Confidence level: 85%\n\n5 years from now: The global average temperature increase is projected to be around 1.4\u00b0C. Confidence level: 70%\n\n10 years from now: The global average temperature increase is expected to reach approximately 1.6\u00b0C. Confidence level: 60%",
            "Explanation": "The TDP method provides a more nuanced view of the uncertainty in temperature projections over time. It shows how confidence decreases for predictions further into the future, reflecting the increasing uncertainty in long-term climate projections. This temporal aspect of uncertainty is not captured by the baseline method, which gives a single point estimate and confidence level."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TDP method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how LLMs reason about temporal uncertainty, focusing on the patterns and biases in their time-dependent predictions. This could yield insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling temporal queries. 2) Explore alternative formulations of the TDP prompt, such as asking the model to explicitly reason about factors that might change its confidence over time. 3) Investigate the combination of TDP with external knowledge retrieval methods to see if grounding the temporal predictions in real-world data improves performance. 4) Develop a new metric for evaluating the quality of uncertainty estimates in time-dependent scenarios, which could be valuable for future research in this area. 5) Analyze how different types of questions (e.g., political predictions vs. scientific advancements) exhibit different patterns of temporal uncertainty, potentially leading to a taxonomy of time-dependent query types and their associated uncertainty characteristics."
