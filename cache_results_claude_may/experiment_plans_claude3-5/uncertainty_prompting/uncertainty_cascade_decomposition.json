    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty across different granularities of knowledge, leading to overconfidence in some areas and underconfidence in others.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on global uncertainty estimation or single-step confidence calibration, missing the nuanced interplay between different levels of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the hierarchical nature of human knowledge and decision-making processes, we propose a method that breaks down complex queries into a cascade of simpler sub-queries, allowing for more precise uncertainty quantification at each level.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Cascade Decomposition (UCD), a multi-step prompting technique that: 1) Decomposes the main query into a hierarchy of sub-queries using a 'decomposition prompt'. 2) Estimates uncertainty for each sub-query using a 'local uncertainty prompt'. 3) Aggregates these local uncertainties using a 'uncertainty propagation prompt' that considers the interdependencies between sub-queries. 4) Generates a final response and overall uncertainty estimate using an 'integration prompt' that combines the aggregated uncertainties with the original query context.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate UCD against standard uncertainty estimation techniques on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MMLU and BigBench, focusing on metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and correlation between estimated and true uncertainty."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Cascade Decomposition: Hierarchical Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty across different granularities of knowledge, leading to overconfidence in some areas and underconfidence in others. This inconsistency in uncertainty estimation can result in unreliable outputs and poor decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on global uncertainty estimation or single-step confidence calibration, missing the nuanced interplay between different levels of uncertainty. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of human knowledge and decision-making processes, we propose a method that breaks down complex queries into a cascade of simpler sub-queries, allowing for more precise uncertainty quantification at each level. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about simpler components while maintaining awareness of the overall problem structure.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Cascade Decomposition (UCD), a multi-step prompting technique that: 1) Decomposes the main query into a hierarchy of sub-queries using a 'decomposition prompt'. 2) Estimates uncertainty for each sub-query using a 'local uncertainty prompt'. 3) Aggregates these local uncertainties using an 'uncertainty propagation prompt' that considers the interdependencies between sub-queries. 4) Generates a final response and overall uncertainty estimate using an 'integration prompt' that combines the aggregated uncertainties with the original query context.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for diverse domain knowledge, focusing on subjects like science, math, and humanities. 2) BigBench for complex reasoning tasks. 3) TruthfulQA for assessing model calibration on questions where the truth may be counterintuitive.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baselines: 1) Direct prompting with uncertainty estimation. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation. 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using different model checkpoints or temperatures.",
            "Step 3: UCD Implementation": "Implement the four-step UCD process: 1) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down the following question into a hierarchy of simpler sub-questions: [QUESTION]' 2) Local uncertainty prompt: 'For each sub-question, provide an answer and estimate your confidence (0-100%): [SUB-QUESTION]' 3) Uncertainty propagation prompt: 'Given the following sub-question confidences, estimate the overall confidence considering their interdependencies: [SUB-CONFIDENCES]' 4) Integration prompt: 'Considering the original question, sub-question answers, and propagated uncertainty, provide a final answer and overall confidence: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION] [SUB_ANSWERS] [PROPAGATED_UNCERTAINTY]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): measure the difference between confidence and accuracy in binned predictions. 4) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at different confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run baseline methods and record their performance. 2) Apply UCD method and record its performance. 3) Collect uncertainty estimates and true outcomes for each method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare UCD performance against baselines using the defined metrics. 2) Analyze how UCD performs across different question types and difficulty levels. 3) Examine the correlation between sub-question uncertainties and final answer uncertainty. 4) Investigate cases where UCD significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two fair six-sided dice? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: The probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two fair six-sided dice is 1/6 or approximately 16.67%. Confidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Decomposition)": "Break down the following question into a hierarchy of simpler sub-questions: What is the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two fair six-sided dice?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. What are the possible outcomes when rolling two dice?\n2. How many ways can we get a sum of 7?\n3. What is the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice?\n4. How do we calculate probability given favorable outcomes and total outcomes?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Local Uncertainty)": "For each sub-question, provide an answer and estimate your confidence (0-100%): 1. What are the possible outcomes when rolling two dice?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Local Uncertainty)": "Answer: The possible outcomes when rolling two dice are all combinations of numbers from 1 to 6 on each die, resulting in sums ranging from 2 to 12. Confidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Given the following sub-question confidences, estimate the overall confidence considering their interdependencies: [100%, 95%, 100%, 98%]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Considering the interdependencies of the sub-questions, the overall confidence can be estimated as 95%. The lowest confidence (95%) in a critical step (counting the ways to get a sum of 7) limits the overall confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Integration)": "Considering the original question, sub-question answers, and propagated uncertainty, provide a final answer and overall confidence: Original question: What is the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two fair six-sided dice? Sub-answers: [Possible outcomes: 2 to 12], [6 ways to get 7], [36 total outcomes], [Probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes] Propagated uncertainty: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Integration)": "Final answer: The probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two fair six-sided dice is 6/36 = 1/6 \u2248 16.67%. Overall confidence: 95%",
            "Explanation": "The UCD method breaks down the problem into manageable sub-questions, allowing for more precise uncertainty estimation at each step. By propagating these uncertainties and considering their interdependencies, we arrive at a final answer with a well-calibrated confidence level. In contrast, the baseline method might overlook important nuances, leading to potentially overconfident or underconfident estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the UCD method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine the quality of the decompositions generated by the model, assessing whether they truly simplify the problem or introduce unnecessary complexity. We might also investigate how different types of questions benefit (or don't) from this decomposition approach. Additionally, we could explore alternative uncertainty aggregation methods, such as weighted averaging based on the perceived importance of each sub-question. Another direction could be to analyze how the model's performance changes with different levels of decomposition granularity, which could provide insights into the optimal complexity of sub-questions for different types of problems. These analyses could lead to a paper on the challenges and limitations of hierarchical uncertainty estimation in language models, offering valuable insights for future research in this area."
