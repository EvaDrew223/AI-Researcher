    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often lack accurate self-assessment of their knowledge boundaries, leading to poor calibration in edge cases or unfamiliar domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing calibration methods typically focus on post-hoc adjustments or simple confidence prompts.",
        "Motivation": "By encouraging the model to recursively analyze its own thought process and knowledge state, we can achieve more accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Metacognitive Calibration (RMC), a multi-step prompting process that guides the model through increasingly deeper levels of self-analysis. The process involves: 1) Initial answer and confidence estimation, 2) Prompt to analyze the reasoning behind the confidence score, 3) Identification of potential knowledge gaps or assumptions, 4) Reassessment of confidence based on this analysis, 5) Repetition of steps 2-4 for a set number of iterations or until convergence. Each prompt builds on the previous responses, encouraging deeper metacognitive reflection.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test RMC against standard confidence prompting and single-step metacognitive prompts on a diverse set of tasks, including both familiar and unfamiliar domains. Evaluate using calibration metrics, and analyze the depth and quality of metacognitive reflections produced at each recursive step."

        "Title": "Recursive Metacognitive Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with accurate self-assessment of their knowledge boundaries, leading to poor calibration in edge cases or unfamiliar domains. This results in overconfident responses in areas where the model's knowledge is limited or uncertain, potentially misleading users and reducing the overall reliability of the system.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods typically focus on post-hoc adjustments or simple confidence prompts, which may not fully capture the nuanced uncertainties in LLM outputs. By encouraging the model to recursively analyze its own thought process and knowledge state, we can achieve more accurate uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to perform deeper self-analysis, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Metacognitive Calibration (RMC), a multi-step prompting process that guides the model through increasingly deeper levels of self-analysis. The process involves: 1) Initial answer and confidence estimation, 2) Prompt to analyze the reasoning behind the confidence score, 3) Identification of potential knowledge gaps or assumptions, 4) Reassessment of confidence based on this analysis, 5) Repetition of steps 2-4 for a set number of iterations or until convergence. Each prompt builds on the previous responses, encouraging deeper metacognitive reflection.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse set of tasks from existing benchmarks, including both familiar and unfamiliar domains. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge, b) MMLU for domain-specific knowledge, and c) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard confidence prompting: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each question. 2) Single-step metacognitive prompt: After the initial answer and confidence score, ask 'Why did you assign this confidence score?'",
            "Step 3: RMC Implementation": "Implement the RMC method with the following steps: a) Initial answer and confidence estimation, b) Analyze reasoning behind confidence, c) Identify knowledge gaps, d) Reassess confidence, e) Repeat b-d for 3 iterations or until confidence stabilizes (less than 5% change).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and RMC): a) Generate responses and confidence scores for all questions, b) Record intermediate steps for RMC, c) Collect final confidence scores and answers.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess performance using: a) Calibration error (difference between confidence and accuracy), b) Brier score, c) ECE (Expected Calibration Error), d) Qualitative analysis of metacognitive reflections.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare RMC against baselines across different task types. Analyze how confidence changes across iterations in RMC. Examine the quality and depth of metacognitive reflections produced at each recursive step."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-step Metacognitive)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100? Why did you assign this confidence score?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-step Metacognitive)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100. I assigned this confidence score because this is a widely known fact that I have encountered numerous times in my training data. The information that Paris is the capital of France is consistent across various reliable sources and is considered common knowledge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RMC; Step 1)": "Q: What is the capital of Burkina Faso? Provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RMC; Step 1)": "A: The capital of Burkina Faso is Ouagadougou. Confidence: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RMC; Step 2)": "Analyze your reasoning behind the confidence score you provided. What factors influenced your level of certainty?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RMC; Step 2)": "I assigned a confidence score of 85 because I recall learning about Ouagadougou being the capital of Burkina Faso. However, my confidence is not 100 because: 1) Burkina Faso is not a country that frequently appears in my training data, 2) I'm aware that capital cities can change over time, and I'm not certain about the recency of my information.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RMC; Step 3)": "Identify any potential knowledge gaps or assumptions in your answer and reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RMC; Step 3)": "Potential knowledge gaps and assumptions: 1) I'm not certain about when this information was last updated in my training data. 2) I don't have specific knowledge about any recent political changes in Burkina Faso that could have affected the capital city. 3) I'm assuming that my recall of Ouagadougou as the capital is accurate and not confused with another West African country.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RMC; Step 4)": "Based on your analysis of reasoning and identification of knowledge gaps, reassess your confidence in the original answer. Provide a new confidence score (0-100) and explain any changes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RMC; Step 4)": "After reassessing, I would adjust my confidence score to 75. The identification of knowledge gaps has made me more aware of the potential for error in my initial response. While I still believe Ouagadougou is likely the correct answer, I recognize that my information might not be up-to-date, and there's a possibility of confusion with other West African capitals.",
            "explanation": "The RMC method demonstrates a more nuanced and self-reflective approach to confidence estimation. Unlike the baseline methods, which might give high confidence scores without deep consideration, RMC encourages the model to critically examine its knowledge and assumptions. This leads to a more calibrated confidence score that better reflects the model's true uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RMC method doesn't significantly improve calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the metacognitive reflections generated during each step of RMC. This could provide insights into how LLMs reason about their own knowledge and uncertainties, potentially informing future calibration methods. Second, we could experiment with variations of the RMC process, such as changing the number of iterations, altering the prompting strategy, or incorporating external knowledge checks. Third, we could investigate how RMC performs across different types of questions or domains, which might reveal patterns in where and why the method succeeds or fails. Finally, we could explore combining RMC with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. These alternative directions could still provide valuable contributions to the field of LLM calibration and metacognition."
