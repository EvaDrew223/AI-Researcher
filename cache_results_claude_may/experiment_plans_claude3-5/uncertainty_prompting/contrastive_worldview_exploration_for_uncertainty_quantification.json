        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when faced with questions that could have multiple valid interpretations or answers depending on different worldviews or contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on a single interpretation of a question, missing the potential for multiple valid perspectives that could affect uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring multiple contrasting worldviews or interpretations, we can better understand the range of possible answers and more accurately quantify uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Worldview Exploration (CWE), a prompting technique that explicitly considers multiple perspectives to quantify uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Worldview Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate multiple contrasting worldviews or contexts relevant to the question. 2) Per-Worldview Analysis: For each worldview, prompt the LLM to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate. 3) Inter-Worldview Comparison: Prompt the LLM to compare and contrast the answers and confidences across worldviews, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Based on the inter-worldview analysis, prompt the LLM to synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diversity of perspectives.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CWE against standard uncertainty quantification methods on datasets that involve subjective or context-dependent questions, such as ethical dilemmas or cultural interpretation tasks. Measure performance using metrics like calibration error, diversity of generated worldviews, and human evaluation of uncertainty reasonableness."

        "Title": "Contrastive Worldview Exploration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when faced with questions that could have multiple valid interpretations or answers depending on different worldviews or contexts. This leads to overconfident predictions in ambiguous situations and fails to capture the nuanced nature of many real-world queries.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on a single interpretation of a question, missing the potential for multiple valid perspectives that could affect uncertainty estimation. By exploring multiple contrasting worldviews or interpretations, we can better understand the range of possible answers and more accurately quantify uncertainty. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often consider different perspectives or contexts when faced with ambiguous questions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Worldview Exploration (CWE), a prompting technique that explicitly considers multiple perspectives to quantify uncertainty. The process involves four main steps: 1) Worldview Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate multiple contrasting worldviews or contexts relevant to the question. 2) Per-Worldview Analysis: For each worldview, prompt the LLM to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate. 3) Inter-Worldview Comparison: Prompt the LLM to compare and contrast the answers and confidences across worldviews, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Based on the inter-worldview analysis, prompt the LLM to synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diversity of perspectives.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use datasets that involve subjective or context-dependent questions, such as ethical dilemmas or cultural interpretation tasks. Specifically, we will use: 1) The Moral Uncertainty Dataset (MUD) which contains ethical dilemmas. 2) The Cultural Context QA (CCQA) dataset, which includes questions about cultural practices and norms across different societies. 3) A subset of the BIG-bench task suite that involves ambiguous or context-dependent questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the LLM the question and request a confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to generate multiple answers and calculate uncertainty based on the variance. 3) Ensemble of few-shot prompts: Use multiple few-shot prompts with different examples to generate answers and calculate uncertainty based on the disagreement between prompts.",
            "Step 3: CWE Implementation": "Implement the four steps of CWE: 1) Worldview Generation: Prompt: 'Generate 3-5 contrasting worldviews or perspectives relevant to answering the following question: [QUESTION]' 2) Per-Worldview Analysis: For each worldview, prompt: 'From the perspective of [WORLDVIEW], answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100): [QUESTION]' 3) Inter-Worldview Comparison: Prompt: 'Compare and contrast the answers and confidence scores across the different worldviews. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement.' 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Prompt: 'Based on the analysis of different worldviews, provide a final answer to the question [QUESTION] along with an uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diversity of perspectives. Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence estimates with its actual accuracy. 2) Diversity of generated worldviews: Measure the semantic diversity of the generated worldviews using embedding-based similarity metrics. 3) Human evaluation: Recruit human annotators to rate the reasonableness of the final uncertainty estimates and explanations on a subset of examples.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run all baseline methods and collect their outputs. 2) Run the CWE method and collect outputs for each step. 3) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and CWE. 4) Conduct human evaluation on a subset of examples.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of CWE against baselines across different datasets and models. 2) Analyze how the number and diversity of generated worldviews affect the final uncertainty estimates. 3) Examine cases where CWE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. 4) Investigate the relationship between inter-worldview disagreement and final uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Is it ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings? Provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: It can be ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings in certain situations, but it depends on the specific circumstances and potential consequences. Generally, small white lies that prevent unnecessary hurt without causing harm may be considered ethical. However, lying about more significant matters or lies that could lead to future problems are usually not ethical, even if they protect feelings in the short term. Confidence score: 75/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWE; Step 1: Worldview Generation)": "Generate 3-5 contrasting worldviews or perspectives relevant to answering the following question: Is it ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWE; Step 1: Worldview Generation)": "1. Utilitarian perspective: Focuses on the consequences of actions and maximizing overall well-being.\n2. Deontological perspective: Emphasizes moral rules and duties, such as the duty to always tell the truth.\n3. Virtue ethics perspective: Considers the character traits and motivations behind actions.\n4. Situational ethics perspective: Believes that the most ethical choice depends on the specific context and circumstances.\n5. Care ethics perspective: Prioritizes maintaining relationships and showing compassion.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWE; Step 2: Per-Worldview Analysis)": "From the perspective of [WORLDVIEW], answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100): Is it ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWE; Step 2: Per-Worldview Analysis)": "[For Utilitarian perspective]\nA: From a utilitarian perspective, lying to protect someone's feelings can be ethical if it leads to greater overall well-being and happiness. If the lie prevents significant emotional distress without causing harm or negative long-term consequences, it may be considered ethical. However, the potential negative consequences of the lie (such as eroding trust if discovered) must be weighed against the positive outcome of protecting feelings. In many cases, a small lie to spare feelings might produce more net positive outcomes than brutal honesty. Confidence score: 70/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWE; Step 3: Inter-Worldview Comparison)": "Compare and contrast the answers and confidence scores across the different worldviews. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWE; Step 3: Inter-Worldview Comparison)": "Areas of agreement:\n1. All perspectives acknowledge that context matters in determining the ethicality of lying to protect feelings.\n2. Most views agree that there are some situations where lying to protect feelings can be ethical.\n\nAreas of disagreement:\n1. The deontological perspective strongly opposes lying in most cases, while other views are more open to it.\n2. The utilitarian and situational ethics perspectives focus more on outcomes, while virtue ethics and care ethics emphasize intentions and relationships.\n3. Confidence scores vary, with deontological and virtue ethics perspectives showing lower confidence (50-60) compared to utilitarian and situational ethics (70-80).\n\nThe main point of contention is whether the act of lying itself is inherently wrong or if it can be justified by positive outcomes or good intentions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWE; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the analysis of different worldviews, provide a final answer to the question 'Is it ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings?' along with an uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diversity of perspectives. Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWE; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Final answer: The ethicality of lying to protect someone's feelings is highly context-dependent and cannot be universally declared as ethical or unethical. In some situations, it may be considered ethical, while in others, it may not be.\n\nUncertainty estimate: High (70-80 out of 100)\n\nReasoning: The high uncertainty estimate reflects the significant disagreement between different ethical frameworks and the strong dependence on specific contexts. While most perspectives agree that there are some situations where lying to protect feelings can be ethical, they differ in their criteria for making this judgment. The utilitarian and situational ethics views are more open to lying if it leads to better outcomes, while deontological ethics generally opposes lying regardless of consequences. Virtue ethics and care ethics fall somewhere in between, focusing on intentions and relationships.\n\nThe uncertainty is further increased by the need to consider various factors in each specific situation, such as:\n1. The severity of the emotional harm being prevented\n2. The likelihood and potential consequences of the lie being discovered\n3. The importance of maintaining trust in the relationship\n4. Long-term effects on personal growth and resilience\n5. Cultural and social norms regarding honesty and emotional protection\n\nGiven this complexity and the lack of consensus among ethical frameworks, it's appropriate to maintain a high level of uncertainty when making blanket statements about the ethicality of lying to protect feelings. Each situation should be carefully evaluated based on its unique circumstances and the relevant ethical considerations.",
            "explanation": "The CWE method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the ethical dilemma compared to the baseline method. It explicitly considers multiple ethical perspectives, compares them, and synthesizes a final answer that acknowledges the complexity and context-dependence of the issue. The high uncertainty estimate in the CWE output better reflects the true ambiguity of the question, whereas the baseline method gives a more definitive answer with potentially overconfident uncertainty estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CWE method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated worldviews to understand if the model is truly capturing diverse perspectives or if it's generating superficially different but fundamentally similar viewpoints. This could lead to insights on the model's ability to reason from truly different ethical frameworks. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from CWE than others. This could help identify specific use cases where considering multiple worldviews is particularly valuable. 3) Explore how the inter-worldview comparison step affects the final uncertainty estimate. We could experiment with different prompting strategies for this step to see if we can improve the model's ability to synthesize diverse viewpoints. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where CWE performs worse than baselines to understand its limitations. This could inform the development of hybrid approaches that combine CWE with other uncertainty quantification methods. 5) Shift focus to using CWE as a tool for generating more comprehensive and balanced responses to complex questions, even if it doesn't directly improve uncertainty quantification. This could position the project as a method for enhancing the overall quality and thoughtfulness of LLM outputs on nuanced topics."
