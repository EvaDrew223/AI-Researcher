        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across different domains and question types, leading to overconfidence in some areas and underconfidence in others.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-question confidence estimation or domain-specific calibration.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to contrast its confidence across different questions and domains, we can potentially achieve better calibration and more nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Prompting (CCP), a technique that presents the model with pairs or sets of questions from different domains and difficulty levels. The prompts are structured to elicit comparative confidence judgments, e.g., 'Which of these questions are you more certain about and why?' This is followed by a series of prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its reasoning process and potential sources of uncertainty for each question. The final step involves synthesizing these comparisons into a calibrated confidence score for each question.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCP against standard single-question confidence estimation techniques on a diverse set of benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Measure improvements in calibration, discrimination, and the ability to generalize confidence estimates across domains."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across different domains and question types, leading to overconfidence in some areas and underconfidence in others. This inconsistency in confidence estimation can result in unreliable outputs and potentially harmful decisions when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on single-question confidence estimation or domain-specific calibration, which may not generalize well across diverse tasks and domains. By prompting the model to contrast its confidence across different questions and domains, we can potentially achieve better calibration and more nuanced uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to perform comparative judgments, which may lead to more accurate and consistent confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Prompting (CCP), a technique that presents the model with pairs or sets of questions from different domains and difficulty levels. The prompts are structured to elicit comparative confidence judgments, e.g., 'Which of these questions are you more certain about and why?' This is followed by a series of prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its reasoning process and potential sources of uncertainty for each question. The final step involves synthesizing these comparisons into a calibrated confidence score for each question.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from multiple domains (e.g., science, history, current events, mathematics) with varying difficulty levels. Use existing benchmarks such as TriviaQA, SQuAD, and MMLU, ensuring a balanced representation of domains and difficulties.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Confidence Estimation": "Implement standard single-question confidence estimation techniques as baselines. This includes: (a) Direct prompting: 'What is the answer to this question, and how confident are you on a scale of 0-100%?'; (b) Likelihood-based confidence: Use the model's output probabilities as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: Implement CCP": "Develop the Contrastive Confidence Prompting method: (a) Create prompt templates for pairwise and set-wise question comparisons; (b) Design follow-up prompts for uncertainty reflection; (c) Implement a method to synthesize comparative judgments into calibrated confidence scores.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Choose a set of LLMs to evaluate, including GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and Claude-v1.3 from Anthropic. Use their respective APIs for experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each model and method (baseline and CCP): (a) Generate answers and confidence estimates for the curated question set; (b) For CCP, generate pairwise and set-wise comparisons, followed by uncertainty reflection and synthesis; (c) Record all outputs, including intermediate steps for CCP.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess the calibration, discrimination, and generalization of confidence estimates: (a) Calculate calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE); (b) Compute discrimination metrics like Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC); (c) Analyze performance across different domains and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: (a) Compare CCP performance against baselines; (b) Examine how CCP affects confidence estimates for different question types and domains; (c) Analyze the model's reasoning in comparative judgments and uncertainty reflection; (d) Investigate cases where CCP significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nHow confident are you in this answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "I am 100% confident in this answer. Paris is widely known and universally recognized as the capital of France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Consider the following two questions:\n1. What is the capital of France?\n2. What is the current population of Tokyo?\nWhich question are you more confident in answering, and why? For each question, explain your reasoning process and potential sources of uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "I am more confident in answering the first question about the capital of France.\n\nFor question 1 (capital of France):\nI am highly confident that the answer is Paris. This is a well-established fact that rarely changes. The sources of uncertainty are minimal, mainly limited to the possibility of a very recent and unlikely change in capital that I might not be aware of.\nConfidence level: Very high (95-100%)\n\nFor question 2 (population of Tokyo):\nI am less confident in providing an exact current population figure for Tokyo. Population numbers change constantly, and the definition of Tokyo (city proper vs. metropolitan area) can affect the answer. My knowledge might also be outdated.\nPotential sources of uncertainty:\n1. Constant population changes\n2. Varying definitions of Tokyo's boundaries\n3. Potential lag in my knowledge of recent census data\n4. Difficulties in accurate population counting in such a large city\nConfidence level: Moderate (60-70%)\n\nIn synthesizing these comparisons, I would assign a confidence score of 98% to the France question and 65% to the Tokyo question.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a single confidence estimate without much reasoning. In contrast, CCP encourages the model to compare questions, consider sources of uncertainty, and provide more nuanced confidence estimates. This process leads to better-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the model's true uncertainty across different types of questions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CCP does not significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the model's comparative reasoning process to understand why it fails to improve calibration. This could involve categorizing different types of reasoning errors or biases that emerge during contrastive prompting. 2) Explore variations of CCP, such as iterative refinement of confidence estimates or incorporating external knowledge sources into the prompting process. 3) Investigate how CCP performs across different model sizes and architectures to understand if its effectiveness is model-dependent. 4) Analyze how CCP affects the model's reasoning process even when it doesn't improve calibration, which could provide insights into the model's decision-making process. 5) Combine CCP with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. These alternative directions could still result in valuable insights into LLM confidence estimation and calibration, even if the original hypothesis is not supported."
