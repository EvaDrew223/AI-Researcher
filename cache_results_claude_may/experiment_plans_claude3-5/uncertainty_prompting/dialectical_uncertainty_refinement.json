        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid perspectives exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple ensemble methods, which may not capture the nuances of conflicting viewpoints.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from the Hegelian dialectic process of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, we propose a method that engages the LLM in a structured debate with itself to refine its uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dialectical Uncertainty Refinement (DUR), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the LLM through a process of self-debate and synthesis. The process begins with an initial response (thesis) to a given query. The LLM is then prompted to generate a counterargument (antithesis) to its original response. Next, the model is asked to reconcile these conflicting viewpoints into a synthesized perspective. At each stage, the LLM is prompted to provide confidence estimates for its statements. The final uncertainty quantification is derived from the trajectory of these confidence estimates throughout the dialectical process, capturing how the model's certainty evolves as it considers multiple perspectives. This method allows for a more nuanced and robust uncertainty estimation that accounts for the complexity of the reasoning task.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DUR against standard confidence estimation techniques on tasks that inherently involve multiple perspectives, such as ethical reasoning, policy analysis, and scientific hypothesis evaluation. We'll use metrics such as Brier Score and Calibration Curves to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates. Additionally, we'll conduct a thorough analysis of the generated dialectical processes to gain insights into how LLMs reason about their own uncertainty."

        "Title": "Dialectical Uncertainty Refinement: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models through Structured Self-Debate",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid perspectives exist. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions in ambiguous situations or underconfident responses in areas where the model actually has reliable knowledge. Improving uncertainty quantification is crucial for building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding model confidence is critical.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple ensemble methods, which may not capture the nuances of conflicting viewpoints or the complexity of the reasoning process. Drawing inspiration from the Hegelian dialectic process of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, we propose a method that engages the LLM in a structured debate with itself to refine its uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's ability to generate diverse perspectives and synthesize information, potentially leading to more nuanced and robust uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dialectical Uncertainty Refinement (DUR), a multi-step prompting technique that guides the LLM through a process of self-debate and synthesis. The process consists of the following steps: 1) Initial response (thesis): The LLM generates an initial answer to the given query, along with a confidence estimate. 2) Counterargument (antithesis): The LLM is prompted to generate a counterargument to its original response, also with a confidence estimate. 3) Synthesis: The model is asked to reconcile these conflicting viewpoints into a synthesized perspective, providing a revised answer and confidence estimate. 4) Uncertainty quantification: The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the trajectory of confidence estimates throughout the dialectical process, capturing how the model's certainty evolves as it considers multiple perspectives.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets to evaluate DUR: 1) Ethical reasoning: The Moral Scenarios dataset from AI2. 2) Policy analysis: A subset of the Policy-QA dataset. 3) Scientific hypothesis evaluation: The SciFact dataset. These datasets are chosen because they inherently involve multiple perspectives and complex reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the LLM to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate. b) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses using different prompts or temperature settings, then aggregate the results. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: If using an open-source model, apply MC Dropout during inference.",
            "Step 3: DUR Implementation": "Implement the Dialectical Uncertainty Refinement method: a) Initial response prompt: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence estimate (0-100%): [QUESTION]' b) Counterargument prompt: 'Now, provide a strong counterargument to your previous answer. Also give a confidence estimate (0-100%) for this counterargument.' c) Synthesis prompt: 'Considering your initial answer and the counterargument, provide a synthesized perspective that reconciles both viewpoints. Give a final answer and a revised confidence estimate (0-100%).'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. If computational resources allow, we will also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates: a) Brier Score: Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. b) Calibration Error: Computes the difference between confidence estimates and actual accuracy. c) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the expected difference between confidence and accuracy. d) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE): Identifies the worst-case miscalibration.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect their predictions and confidence estimates. b) Run the DUR method, collecting the initial, counterargument, and synthesized responses along with their respective confidence estimates. c) Calculate the final DUR confidence estimate based on the trajectory of estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of DUR against baselines using the evaluation metrics. b) Analyze the trajectory of confidence estimates throughout the dialectical process. c) Perform a qualitative analysis of the generated dialectical processes to gain insights into how LLMs reason about their own uncertainty. d) Investigate how the performance of DUR varies across different types of questions and domains."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Should governments implement a universal basic income? Provide your answer and a confidence estimate (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Yes, governments should implement a universal basic income. It could help reduce poverty, provide a safety net for workers in an increasingly automated economy, and potentially stimulate economic growth through increased consumer spending. However, there are concerns about its cost and potential negative effects on work incentives. Confidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Initial Response)": "Q: Should governments implement a universal basic income? Provide your answer and a confidence estimate (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Initial Response)": "A: Yes, governments should implement a universal basic income. It could help reduce poverty, provide a safety net for workers in an increasingly automated economy, and potentially stimulate economic growth through increased consumer spending. Confidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Counterargument)": "Now, provide a strong counterargument to your previous answer. Also give a confidence estimate (0-100%) for this counterargument.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Counterargument)": "Counterargument: Governments should not implement a universal basic income. It would be prohibitively expensive, potentially leading to increased taxes or national debt. It might reduce the incentive to work, causing labor shortages in essential sectors. Additionally, it could lead to inflation as more money enters the economy, potentially negating its benefits for the poor. Confidence: 70%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Synthesis)": "Considering your initial answer and the counterargument, provide a synthesized perspective that reconciles both viewpoints. Give a final answer and a revised confidence estimate (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Synthesis)": "Synthesized perspective: The implementation of a universal basic income (UBI) is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. While UBI could potentially reduce poverty and provide economic security in an increasingly automated world, there are significant concerns about its cost, impact on work incentives, and potential inflationary effects. A more nuanced approach might be to consider targeted basic income programs for specific vulnerable populations or to implement UBI on a small scale as pilot programs to study its effects before considering widespread implementation. Given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding this issue, a definitive 'yes' or 'no' answer is not appropriate. Final answer: Governments should carefully consider and study the implementation of UBI through targeted programs or pilot studies before deciding on widespread adoption. Revised confidence: 60%",
            "Explanation": "The DUR method allows the model to consider multiple perspectives and refine its uncertainty estimate. The initial response was quite confident (75%) in supporting UBI. The counterargument introduced valid concerns with a similar level of confidence (70%). In the synthesis step, the model recognized the complexity of the issue and provided a more nuanced response with a lower confidence estimate (60%), reflecting the uncertainty inherent in this complex policy question. This process leads to a more calibrated uncertainty estimate compared to the initial, potentially overconfident response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DUR method does not significantly improve uncertainty calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the dialectical processes generated by the model to understand why the method didn't improve calibration. This could provide valuable insights into how LLMs reason about uncertainty and potentially inform the development of improved methods. 2) Experiment with variations of the DUR method, such as increasing the number of dialectical steps or modifying the prompts to encourage more diverse perspectives. 3) Investigate how the effectiveness of DUR varies across different types of questions, domains, or models. This could lead to insights about which scenarios benefit most from dialectical reasoning. 4) Combine DUR with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration post-processing, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 5) If the dialectical process consistently produces valuable intermediate outputs even if the final calibration doesn't improve, we could refocus the project on using DUR as a method for generating more comprehensive and balanced responses to complex questions, rather than solely for uncertainty quantification."
