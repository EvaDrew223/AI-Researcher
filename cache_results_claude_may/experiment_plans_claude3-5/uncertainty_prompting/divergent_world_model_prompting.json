        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in scenarios that require reasoning about multiple possible world states or interpretations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct uncertainty estimation or use ensemble methods that may not capture fundamentally different world models.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of multiple-worlds interpretation in physics, we hypothesize that explicitly prompting models to reason about divergent possible world states could lead to more comprehensive uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Divergent World Model Prompting (DWMP), a method that encourages models to explore and reason about multiple possible world states when answering queries. The process involves: 1) World State Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple distinct 'world models' or interpretations that could be relevant to the query. 2) Per-World Reasoning: For each generated world model, prompt the model to reason about the query as if that world state were true, providing an answer and confidence specific to that world. 3) Inter-World Analysis: Guide the model to compare and contrast the reasoning and answers across different world models, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Based on the inter-world analysis, prompt the model to synthesize an overall uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diversity and plausibility of the different world models. 5) Final Answer Formulation: Instruct the model to provide a final answer that integrates insights from across the different world models, along with the synthesized uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare DWMP against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on tasks requiring multi-world reasoning, such as commonsense reasoning datasets (e.g., COPA, ReCoRD) and ambiguous query datasets. Evaluate using calibration metrics, answer quality, and the model's ability to identify genuinely ambiguous scenarios."

        "Title": "Divergent World Model Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in scenarios that require reasoning about multiple possible world states or interpretations. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions in ambiguous situations, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in language models typically focus on direct uncertainty estimation or use ensemble methods that may not capture fundamentally different world models. Inspired by the concept of multiple-worlds interpretation in physics, we hypothesize that explicitly prompting models to reason about divergent possible world states could lead to more comprehensive uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the model's inherent ability to consider multiple perspectives and should provide a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Divergent World Model Prompting (DWMP), a method that encourages models to explore and reason about multiple possible world states when answering queries. The process involves five key steps: 1) World State Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple distinct 'world models' or interpretations that could be relevant to the query. 2) Per-World Reasoning: For each generated world model, prompt the model to reason about the query as if that world state were true, providing an answer and confidence specific to that world. 3) Inter-World Analysis: Guide the model to compare and contrast the reasoning and answers across different world models, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Based on the inter-world analysis, prompt the model to synthesize an overall uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diversity and plausibility of the different world models. 5) Final Answer Formulation: Instruct the model to provide a final answer that integrates insights from across the different world models, along with the synthesized uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select and prepare datasets that require multi-world reasoning: a) COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives): 1000 examples of commonsense causal reasoning. b) ReCoRD (Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning): 120,000 examples of reading comprehension requiring commonsense reasoning. c) AmbigQA: 14,042 examples of questions with multiple valid answers due to ambiguity.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. These models provide strong baseline performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard prompting: Direct question answering without uncertainty quantification. b) Monte Carlo Dropout: Use 10 forward passes with dropout enabled to estimate uncertainty. c) Ensemble of 5 different prompt templates: Use variations of the question to create an ensemble for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 4: DWMP Implementation": "Implement the Divergent World Model Prompting method with the following steps: a) World State Generation: Prompt: 'Generate 3 distinct possible world states or interpretations relevant to this query: [QUERY]' b) Per-World Reasoning: For each world state, prompt: 'Assuming the world state [WORLD_STATE] is true, answer the following query and provide a confidence score (0-100): [QUERY]' c) Inter-World Analysis: Prompt: 'Compare and contrast the reasoning and answers across the different world models. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement.' d) Uncertainty Synthesis: Prompt: 'Based on the inter-world analysis, provide an overall uncertainty estimate (0-100) that accounts for the diversity and plausibility of the different world models.' e) Final Answer Formulation: Prompt: 'Provide a final answer to the query that integrates insights from across the different world models, along with the synthesized uncertainty estimate.'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Answer Quality: Use dataset-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy for COPA, F1 score for ReCoRD). b) Calibration: Compute Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). c) Uncertainty Quality: Compute Brier Score and Negative Log Likelihood. d) Ambiguity Detection: For AmbigQA, measure the model's ability to identify genuinely ambiguous questions (precision, recall, F1).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and DWMP): a) Run the method on the entire dataset. b) Collect predictions, confidence scores, and uncertainty estimates. c) Calculate all evaluation metrics. d) Record computation time and number of API calls for efficiency comparison.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare DWMP against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze how DWMP performs on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning-heavy). c) Examine the generated world states and inter-world analyses to gain insights into the model's reasoning process. d) Investigate cases where DWMP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines. e) Analyze the relationship between the number of world states generated and performance improvements.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each DWMP component: a) Vary the number of world states generated (1, 3, 5). b) Remove the inter-world analysis step. c) Use only the highest-confidence world state for the final answer."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: A man is having trouble hearing people speak. What might be the cause? A:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "The cause of the man's trouble hearing people speak could be hearing loss or impairment. This could be due to various factors such as age-related hearing loss (presbycusis), exposure to loud noises, ear infections, or certain medical conditions.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 1: World State Generation)": "Generate 3 distinct possible world states or interpretations relevant to this query: A man is having trouble hearing people speak. What might be the cause?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 1: World State Generation)": "1. Medical Condition World: The man has a physical or neurological condition affecting his hearing.\n2. Environmental Factors World: The man's hearing difficulty is due to external environmental factors.\n3. Psychological Factors World: The man's hearing trouble is related to psychological or cognitive issues.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 2: Per-World Reasoning)": "Assuming the world state 'Medical Condition World: The man has a physical or neurological condition affecting his hearing' is true, answer the following query and provide a confidence score (0-100): A man is having trouble hearing people speak. What might be the cause?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 2: Per-World Reasoning)": "In the Medical Condition World, the cause of the man's trouble hearing people speak is likely a physical or neurological condition affecting his hearing. Possible causes include:\n1. Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis)\n2. Noise-induced hearing loss\n3. Ear infections or inflammation\n4. Ototoxic medications damaging the ear\n5. Meniere's disease\n6. Acoustic neuroma (a benign tumor on the auditory nerve)\n7. Otosclerosis (abnormal bone growth in the middle ear)\n\nConfidence score: 85/100\n\nThe high confidence score is due to the prevalence of medical conditions causing hearing difficulties. However, there's still some uncertainty as the specific condition is not identified, and the severity and duration of the symptoms are unknown.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 3: Inter-World Analysis)": "Compare and contrast the reasoning and answers across the different world models. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 3: Inter-World Analysis)": "Comparing the three world models:\n\n1. Areas of Agreement:\n- All world models acknowledge that there can be multiple causes for the man's hearing difficulty.\n- Each model recognizes that the cause could be complex and multifaceted.\n\n2. Areas of Disagreement:\n- The primary focus of each world model differs significantly:\n  a. Medical Condition World focuses on physical and neurological causes.\n  b. Environmental Factors World emphasizes external influences.\n  c. Psychological Factors World considers cognitive and mental aspects.\n\n3. Complementary Insights:\n- The combination of these world models provides a more comprehensive view of potential causes.\n- Some causes could span multiple world models (e.g., stress could be both psychological and lead to physical symptoms).\n\n4. Confidence Levels:\n- The Medical Condition World typically has higher confidence due to well-established medical knowledge.\n- Environmental and Psychological Worlds might have lower confidence due to more variable and context-dependent factors.\n\n5. Implications for Diagnosis:\n- A thorough assessment would need to consider factors from all three world models to ensure a comprehensive diagnosis.\n\nThis analysis highlights the complexity of the issue and the importance of considering multiple perspectives when addressing the man's hearing difficulty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Based on the inter-world analysis, provide an overall uncertainty estimate (0-100) that accounts for the diversity and plausibility of the different world models.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 4: Uncertainty Synthesis)": "Overall uncertainty estimate: 40/100\n\nReasoning:\n1. Diversity of Causes: The three world models present a wide range of potential causes, from medical conditions to environmental factors and psychological issues. This diversity increases uncertainty as it's unclear which category the true cause falls into.\n\n2. Plausibility: All three world models offer plausible explanations, which reduces uncertainty to some extent. The medical model, in particular, provides well-established causes that are commonly observed.\n\n3. Lack of Specific Information: Without more details about the man's symptoms, medical history, and environment, it's challenging to narrow down the cause, contributing to uncertainty.\n\n4. Potential for Multiple Factors: The cause could involve a combination of factors from different world models, adding complexity and uncertainty.\n\n5. Diagnostic Challenges: Some causes (especially psychological or certain environmental factors) may be harder to diagnose definitively, increasing uncertainty.\n\n6. Confidence Levels: The higher confidence in the medical model (85/100) is balanced by lower confidence in the other models, leading to a moderate overall uncertainty.\n\nThe estimate of 40/100 reflects a moderate level of uncertainty. While we have a good understanding of potential causes, the lack of specific information and the possibility of complex, multi-factor causes prevent a high degree of certainty in identifying the exact cause without further investigation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DWMP; Step 5: Final Answer Formulation)": "Provide a final answer to the query that integrates insights from across the different world models, along with the synthesized uncertainty estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DWMP; Step 5: Final Answer Formulation)": "Final Answer: The man's trouble hearing people speak could be caused by a variety of factors, with an overall uncertainty estimate of 40/100. The potential causes can be categorized into three main areas:\n\n1. Medical Conditions: This is the most likely category, including issues such as age-related hearing loss, noise-induced hearing damage, ear infections, or neurological conditions affecting hearing.\n\n2. Environmental Factors: The man's difficulty could be due to external influences like a noisy environment, poor acoustics, or distance from speakers.\n\n3. Psychological Factors: Cognitive issues, stress, attention deficits, or auditory processing disorders could also contribute to the problem.\n\nIt's important to note that the cause might involve a combination of factors from these categories. For example, a mild hearing impairment (medical) could be exacerbated by a stressful situation (psychological) in a noisy environment (environmental).\n\nGiven the moderate uncertainty (40/100), a definitive diagnosis would require further investigation. This should include a medical examination focusing on ear health and hearing tests, an assessment of the man's typical environments, and potentially a psychological evaluation. The interplay between these factors highlights the importance of a holistic approach to addressing the man's hearing difficulties.\n\nThis comprehensive answer, derived from multiple world models, provides a more nuanced understanding of the potential causes and the complexity of the situation compared to a single-perspective response.",
            "explanation": "The DWMP method provides a more comprehensive and nuanced answer compared to standard prompting. It explicitly considers multiple possible world states, reasons about each, and synthesizes an overall uncertainty estimate. This approach leads to a final answer that acknowledges the complexity of the situation, considers various potential causes, and provides a quantified measure of uncertainty. In contrast, the standard prompting method gives a more limited answer focused primarily on medical causes, without explicitly addressing uncertainty or alternative explanations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DWMP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines according to our success criteria, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why DWMP fails. This might involve categorizing errors (e.g., irrelevant world states, poor inter-world analysis) and correlating them with question types or domains. We could then use these insights to refine the DWMP method, perhaps by developing more targeted prompts for world state generation or improving the inter-world analysis step. Additionally, we could explore combining DWMP with other techniques, such as using it as a component in a larger ensemble method or integrating it with retrieval-augmented generation. Another direction could be to focus on the interpretability aspects of DWMP, analyzing how the generated world states and reasoning steps provide insight into the model's decision-making process. This could turn the project into an analysis paper on LLM reasoning strategies in uncertain scenarios. Finally, if the method shows promise in specific subsets of questions or domains, we could narrow our focus to these areas and develop specialized versions of DWMP for different types of reasoning tasks."
