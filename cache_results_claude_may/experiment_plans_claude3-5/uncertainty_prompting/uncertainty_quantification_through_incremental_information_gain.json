        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when dealing with complex queries that require synthesizing multiple pieces of information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single-shot confidence estimation or ensemble methods.",

The method involves: 1) Query decomposition into sub-questions, 2) Sequential prompting to answer each sub-question, 3) Tracking confidence changes as new information is incorporated, 4) Aggregating sub-confidences using a custom prompting strategy that considers information dependencies.

        "Title": "Incremental Information Gain Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when dealing with complex queries that require synthesizing multiple pieces of information. This limitation can lead to overconfident incorrect answers or underconfident correct answers, reducing the reliability and usefulness of LLMs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches often rely on single-shot confidence estimation or ensemble methods, which may not capture the nuanced process of building confidence as new information is processed. Human experts often build up confidence gradually as they gather and process relevant information. Mimicking this process could lead to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty estimates in LLMs. By breaking down complex queries into atomic sub-questions and tracking confidence changes as new information is incorporated, we can potentially achieve more reliable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Incremental Information Gain Prompting (IIGP), a novel technique that breaks down complex queries into atomic sub-questions. The method involves four main steps: 1) Query decomposition into sub-questions, 2) Sequential prompting to answer each sub-question, 3) Tracking confidence changes as new information is incorporated, 4) Aggregating sub-confidences using a custom prompting strategy that considers information dependencies. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the trajectory of confidence changes throughout the process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use multi-hop reasoning datasets such as HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. These datasets contain complex questions that require synthesizing information from multiple sources, making them ideal for evaluating our method.",
            "Step 2: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Ensemble method using multiple LLM calls. For direct prompting, we'll use a prompt like 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]'. For the ensemble method, we'll make multiple calls to the LLM and aggregate the results.",
            "Step 3: Implement IIGP": "a) Query Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the main question into sub-questions. Example prompt: 'Break down the following question into 2-4 sub-questions that, when answered, will help solve the main question: [MAIN_QUESTION]'\nb) Sequential Prompting: For each sub-question, prompt the LLM to answer and provide a confidence score. Example prompt: 'Answer the following sub-question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [SUB_QUESTION]'\nc) Confidence Tracking: Store the confidence scores for each sub-question answer.\nd) Aggregation: Prompt the LLM to aggregate the sub-question answers and provide a final answer with confidence. Example prompt: 'Given the following sub-questions and their answers with confidence scores, provide a final answer to the main question with an overall confidence score: [SUB_QA_LIST] Main question: [MAIN_QUESTION]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models have shown strong performance on complex reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Answer Accuracy: Compare the generated answers with ground truth. 2) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. 3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Compute the weighted average of the calibration error across different confidence bins. 4) Confidence-Performance Correlation: Calculate the Pearson correlation between confidence scores and answer correctness.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of IIGP: a) Vary the number of sub-questions. b) Compare different aggregation strategies. c) Analyze the impact of confidence tracking granularity.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform qualitative analysis on a subset of examples to understand: a) How the confidence changes across sub-questions. b) How the final confidence compares to baseline methods. c) Cases where IIGP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the year Freddie Mercury was born?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1946, the year Freddie Mercury was born, was 'The Best Years of Our Lives', directed by William Wyler. Confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IIGP; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "Break down the following question into 2-4 sub-questions that, when answered, will help solve the main question: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the year Freddie Mercury was born?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IIGP; Step 1: Query Decomposition)": "1. In which year was Freddie Mercury born?\n2. Which film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in that year?\n3. Who directed that film?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IIGP; Step 2: Sequential Prompting)": "Answer the following sub-question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: In which year was Freddie Mercury born?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IIGP; Step 2: Sequential Prompting)": "Freddie Mercury was born in 1946. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IIGP; Step 3: Aggregation)": "Given the following sub-questions and their answers with confidence scores, provide a final answer to the main question with an overall confidence score:\n1. In which year was Freddie Mercury born? Answer: 1946 (Confidence: 95)\n2. Which film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in that year? Answer: 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (Confidence: 90)\n3. Who directed that film? Answer: William Wyler (Confidence: 92)\nMain question: Who was the director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the year Freddie Mercury was born?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IIGP; Step 3: Aggregation)": "The director of the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the year Freddie Mercury was born was William Wyler. Overall confidence score: 89",
            "Explanation": "IIGP breaks down the complex question into simpler sub-questions, allowing for more precise confidence estimation at each step. The final aggregation step considers the confidence scores of all sub-questions, resulting in a more nuanced and potentially more accurate overall confidence score compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If IIGP doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can explore several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the correlation between sub-question confidences and final answer correctness to understand if certain types of sub-questions are more informative for uncertainty estimation. This could lead to a weighted aggregation strategy where some sub-questions contribute more to the final confidence score. Second, we could investigate whether the order of sub-questions affects the final confidence, potentially leading to an adaptive questioning strategy. Third, we could explore incorporating external knowledge sources to verify sub-question answers, which might help in cases where the LLM's internal knowledge is inconsistent or outdated. Finally, if these approaches don't yield significant improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper that provides insights into how LLMs build confidence across different types of reasoning tasks, which could inform future work on improving uncertainty quantification in LLMs."
