    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often express high confidence in their outputs without considering alternative scenarios or the robustness of their reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on adjusting the model's direct confidence estimates without exploring counterfactual scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to consider counterfactual scenarios and how they might affect its confidence, we can potentially achieve more robust and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Confidence Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that calibrates model confidence by exploring counterfactual scenarios. For a given query and initial response, CCC involves the following steps: (1) Counterfactual generation: We prompt the model to generate plausible alternative scenarios or facts that, if true, would change its answer or confidence. (2) Impact analysis: For each counterfactual, we prompt the model to reassess its answer and confidence. (3) Robustness evaluation: We ask the model to evaluate the robustness of its original answer by considering the range of counterfactuals and their impacts. (4) Calibration: Based on this robustness evaluation, we prompt the model to provide a calibrated confidence estimate that accounts for the counterfactual space explored. This method aims to produce uncertainty estimates that reflect not just the model's initial confidence, but also the stability of its answer across plausible alternative scenarios.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CCC on tasks requiring nuanced confidence estimation, such as open-ended question answering and claim verification. We'll compare it with standard calibration methods, focusing on metrics like expected calibration error and robustness to slight changes in input. We'll also analyze how the diversity and plausibility of generated counterfactuals correlate with the quality of calibrated confidence estimates."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Estimates in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often express high confidence in their outputs without considering alternative scenarios or the robustness of their reasoning. This can lead to overconfident and potentially unreliable predictions, especially in complex or ambiguous situations.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods typically focus on adjusting the model's direct confidence estimates without exploring counterfactual scenarios. By prompting the model to consider counterfactual scenarios and how they might affect its confidence, we can potentially achieve more robust and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to produce more nuanced and context-aware confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Confidence Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that calibrates model confidence by exploring counterfactual scenarios. For a given query and initial response, CCC involves the following steps: (1) Counterfactual generation: We prompt the model to generate plausible alternative scenarios or facts that, if true, would change its answer or confidence. (2) Impact analysis: For each counterfactual, we prompt the model to reassess its answer and confidence. (3) Robustness evaluation: We ask the model to evaluate the robustness of its original answer by considering the range of counterfactuals and their impacts. (4) Calibration: Based on this robustness evaluation, we prompt the model to provide a calibrated confidence estimate that accounts for the counterfactual space explored.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for evaluation: (1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, and (2) FEVER for claim verification. These datasets cover a range of topics and require nuanced confidence estimation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. (2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to generate multiple answers and use their variance as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: CCC Implementation": "Implement the four steps of CCC: (1) Counterfactual generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 plausible counterfactuals. (2) Impact analysis: For each counterfactual, prompt the model to reassess its answer and confidence. (3) Robustness evaluation: Prompt the model to evaluate the overall robustness of its original answer. (4) Calibration: Prompt the model to provide a final calibrated confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of baseline methods and CCC using the following metrics: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (2) Brier Score, (3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), and (4) Robustness to slight input perturbations.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform additional analyses: (1) Correlation between the diversity of generated counterfactuals and the quality of calibrated estimates. (2) Qualitative analysis of generated counterfactuals and their impact on confidence calibration. (3) Comparison of CCC performance across different types of questions or claims."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please also provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Counterfactual Generation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Generate 3 plausible alternative scenarios or facts that, if true, would change your answer or confidence about who was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Counterfactual Generation)": "1. If the Apollo 11 mission had failed, and Apollo 12 had been the first successful moon landing.\n2. If Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov had secretly landed on the moon before the Apollo missions.\n3. If historical records about the moon landing had been deliberately falsified for propaganda purposes during the Cold War.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Impact Analysis)": "For each of the counterfactuals generated, reassess your answer and confidence about who was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Impact Analysis)": "1. If Apollo 11 failed: The first person would likely be Charles Conrad from Apollo 12. Confidence: 80%\n2. If Alexei Leonov landed first: Alexei Leonov would be the answer. Confidence: 60%\n3. If records were falsified: Unable to determine with certainty. Confidence: 30%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Robustness Evaluation)": "Evaluate the robustness of the original answer (Neil Armstrong) by considering the range of counterfactuals and their impacts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Robustness Evaluation)": "The original answer of Neil Armstrong is moderately robust. While it remains the most likely answer, the counterfactuals reveal potential scenarios that could significantly change our confidence. The possibility of falsified records or undisclosed missions introduces non-trivial uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Calibration)": "Based on the original answer, the counterfactuals explored, and the robustness evaluation, provide a calibrated confidence estimate for the statement: 'Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Calibration)": "Calibrated confidence estimate: 85%. While Neil Armstrong is still the most likely answer based on available evidence, the exploration of counterfactuals reveals some degree of uncertainty, particularly related to potential undisclosed missions or historical inaccuracies.",
            "Explanation": "The CCC method provides a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated confidence estimate by explicitly considering alternative scenarios. The baseline method might give an overconfident estimate without considering these possibilities, while CCC encourages a more thorough evaluation of the certainty of the answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCC method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Analyze the quality and diversity of generated counterfactuals to understand if the method's performance is limited by the counterfactual generation step. This could lead to insights on improving prompt engineering for counterfactual generation. (2) Investigate whether CCC performs differently across various types of questions or domains, which could reveal where the method is most effective or where it needs improvement. (3) Explore combining CCC with other calibration methods, such as ensemble techniques or meta-learning approaches, to see if a hybrid method could yield better results. (4) Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify patterns in cases where CCC fails to improve calibration, which could inform the development of more targeted calibration strategies."
