    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to provide consistent and well-calibrated confidence estimates across semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on confidence estimation for individual queries without considering their potential transformations.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by metamorphic testing in software engineering, we propose that exploring the confidence landscape across semantically preserved transformations of a query can yield more robust uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Confidence Mapping (MCM), a technique that systematically explores and aggregates confidence estimates across a space of query transformations. The method involves: 1) Semantic preservation prompting: Generate a diverse set of semantically equivalent transformations of the original query using the model itself. 2) Confidence landscape exploration: Prompt the model with each transformation, collecting both answers and confidence estimates to form a 'confidence map'. 3) Invariance analysis: Identify regions of the confidence map that remain stable across transformations, indicating more reliable estimates. 4) Transformation sensitivity quantification: Measure how much the confidence estimates change across different types of transformations (e.g., paraphrasing, formal vs. informal language). 5) Meta-confidence computation: Aggregate the confidence landscape into a final uncertainty estimate, weighing stable regions more heavily.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MCM against standard confidence estimation techniques on existing benchmarks and a new dataset specifically designed to test robustness to query transformations. Evaluate using both traditional calibration metrics and novel measures of transformation invariance."

        "Title": "Metamorphic Confidence Mapping: Robust Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to provide consistent and well-calibrated confidence estimates across semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse queries. This inconsistency limits their reliability in real-world applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically focus on confidence estimation for individual queries without considering their potential transformations. Inspired by metamorphic testing in software engineering, we propose that exploring the confidence landscape across semantically preserved transformations of a query can yield more robust uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to generate and evaluate diverse query formulations, potentially uncovering more stable and reliable confidence patterns.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Metamorphic Confidence Mapping (MCM), a technique that systematically explores and aggregates confidence estimates across a space of query transformations. The method involves five key steps: 1) Semantic preservation prompting: Generate a diverse set of semantically equivalent transformations of the original query using the model itself. 2) Confidence landscape exploration: Prompt the model with each transformation, collecting both answers and confidence estimates to form a 'confidence map'. 3) Invariance analysis: Identify regions of the confidence map that remain stable across transformations, indicating more reliable estimates. 4) Transformation sensitivity quantification: Measure how much the confidence estimates change across different types of transformations (e.g., paraphrasing, formal vs. informal language). 5) Meta-confidence computation: Aggregate the confidence landscape into a final uncertainty estimate, weighing stable regions more heavily.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, and 2) MMLU for multi-task language understanding. These datasets cover a wide range of topics and question types, allowing us to test the robustness of MCM across diverse domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Use the model's raw confidence score for the original query. 2) Calibrated confidence: Apply temperature scaling to calibrate the raw confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: MCM Implementation": "Implement the five steps of MCM:\n1) Semantic preservation prompting: Use the following prompt to generate query transformations: 'Rephrase the following question in 5 different ways while preserving its original meaning: [ORIGINAL_QUERY]'\n2) Confidence landscape exploration: For each transformation, use the prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): [TRANSFORMED_QUERY]'\n3) Invariance analysis: Calculate the standard deviation of confidence scores across transformations for each answer.\n4) Transformation sensitivity quantification: Compute the average change in confidence scores between the original query and its transformations.\n5) Meta-confidence computation: Calculate a weighted average of confidence scores, with weights inversely proportional to the standard deviation from step 3.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics:\n1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n2) Brier Score\n3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)\n4) Transformation Invariance Score (TIS): The average standard deviation of confidence scores across transformations (lower is better)",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination:\n1) Run the baseline methods and collect their confidence estimates and performance metrics.\n2) Run MCM and collect its meta-confidence estimates and performance metrics.\n3) Compare the results using the evaluation metrics defined in Step 5.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare MCM against baselines in terms of calibration (ECE) and overall performance (Brier Score, AUPRC).\n2) Analyze the relationship between transformation invariance (TIS) and calibration quality.\n3) Investigate how different types of semantic transformations affect confidence estimates.\n4) Examine cases where MCM significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Semantic Preservation)": "Rephrase the following question in 5 different ways while preserving its original meaning: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Semantic Preservation)": "1. Which individual first set foot on the lunar surface?\n2. Who made history as the inaugural moon walker?\n3. What astronaut was the pioneer in stepping onto the moon?\n4. Can you name the person who initially walked on the moon?\n5. Who holds the distinction of being the first human to tread on lunar soil?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Confidence Landscape Exploration)": "Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): Which individual first set foot on the lunar surface?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Confidence Landscape Exploration)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first individual to set foot on the lunar surface. Confidence: 98%",
            "Explanation": "MCM generates multiple semantically equivalent queries and aggregates confidence estimates across them. This approach can reveal inconsistencies in the model's confidence and provide a more robust uncertainty estimate. In this example, the slight increase in confidence (from 95% to 98%) for a rephrased version of the question suggests that the model's understanding is consistent across different phrasings, potentially indicating a more reliable confidence estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MCM does not significantly improve calibration or robustness compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how different types of semantic transformations affect confidence estimates. This could reveal insights into the model's sensitivity to linguistic variations. 2) Investigate the relationship between confidence stability and factual correctness. We could examine whether answers with more stable confidence across transformations are more likely to be correct. 3) Explore alternative aggregation methods for the confidence landscape, such as using machine learning models to predict meta-confidence based on the confidence map features. 4) Extend the study to compare MCM's performance across different model sizes and architectures, which could provide insights into how model scale affects confidence calibration and robustness."
