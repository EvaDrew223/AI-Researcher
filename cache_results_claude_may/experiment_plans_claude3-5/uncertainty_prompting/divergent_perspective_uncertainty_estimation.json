        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence due to limited perspective, failing to consider alternative viewpoints that might introduce uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-perspective confidence estimation or basic ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to adopt multiple, potentially conflicting perspectives, we can uncover hidden uncertainties and achieve more robust uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Divergent Perspective Uncertainty Estimation (DPUE), a multi-stage prompting technique. First, we prompt the model to generate several distinct 'expert personas' with varying backgrounds relevant to the query. Then, we ask each persona to provide an answer and confidence estimate. Next, we prompt a 'mediator' persona to analyze agreements and disagreements among the experts, explicitly reasoning about the sources of uncertainty. Finally, we ask the mediator to synthesize a final answer and calibrated uncertainty estimate based on this analysis.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate DPUE on diverse datasets covering contentious topics in science, politics, and ethics. Compare against single-perspective confidence estimation and simple ensemble methods. Measure improvements in calibration, uncertainty range, and correlation with human expert disagreement levels."

        "Title": "Divergent Perspective Uncertainty Estimation: Calibrating LLM Confidence through Multi-Persona Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to accurately quantify uncertainty or consider alternative viewpoints that might introduce doubt. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications and a false sense of certainty in complex or ambiguous scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically rely on single-perspective confidence estimation or basic ensemble methods, which may not capture the full range of potential uncertainties. By prompting the model to adopt multiple, potentially conflicting perspectives, we can uncover hidden uncertainties and achieve more robust uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human decision-making processes, where considering diverse viewpoints often leads to more nuanced and well-calibrated judgments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Divergent Perspective Uncertainty Estimation (DPUE), a multi-stage prompting technique. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Generate Expert Personas: Prompt the model to create several distinct 'expert personas' with varying backgrounds relevant to the query. 2) Collect Persona Responses: Ask each persona to provide an answer and confidence estimate. 3) Mediator Analysis: Prompt a 'mediator' persona to analyze agreements and disagreements among the experts, explicitly reasoning about the sources of uncertainty. 4) Synthesize Final Answer: Ask the mediator to synthesize a final answer and calibrated uncertainty estimate based on this analysis.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse dataset covering contentious topics in science, politics, and ethics. Use existing datasets such as SciQ for scientific questions, PolitiFact for political claims, and MoralQA for ethical dilemmas. Ensure a mix of questions with varying levels of factual certainty and ethical complexity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Single-perspective confidence estimation: Directly ask the LLM to provide an answer and confidence score. b) Simple ensemble method: Generate multiple responses and aggregate confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: DPUE Implementation": "Implement the four-step DPUE method: 1) Expert Persona Generation: Prompt: 'Generate 3-5 expert personas with diverse backgrounds relevant to answering the following question: [QUESTION]' 2) Persona Response Collection: For each persona, prompt: '[PERSONA], please answer the following question and provide a confidence score (0-100): [QUESTION]' 3) Mediator Analysis: Prompt: 'As a neutral mediator, analyze the agreements and disagreements among the expert responses. Identify key sources of uncertainty.' 4) Final Synthesis: Prompt: 'Based on the expert responses and your analysis, provide a final answer to the question and a calibrated uncertainty estimate (0-100).'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments. Additionally, test with GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude-v1.3 to assess generalizability across different LLMs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare model confidence with actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Uncertainty range: Assess the spread of confidence estimates across personas. d) Correlation with human expert disagreement: Compare model uncertainty with levels of disagreement among human experts (requires additional data collection or use of existing expert-annotated datasets).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on the prepared dataset using both baseline methods and DPUE. Collect results for each method across all evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare DPUE performance against baselines. Analyze how DPUE performs across different types of questions (scientific, political, ethical). Examine cases where DPUE significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines to identify strengths and limitations of the method.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of each DPUE component: a) Vary the number of expert personas. b) Remove the mediator analysis step. c) Use different prompts for persona generation and mediator analysis.",
            "Step 9: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to assess the quality and interpretability of DPUE outputs compared to baselines. Focus on a subset of challenging questions where expert human judgment is particularly valuable."

            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "What is the current scientific consensus on the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for human consumption?",
                "Single-Perspective Output": "The current scientific consensus is that GMOs are safe for human consumption. Numerous studies have shown no adverse health effects from consuming GMO foods. Confidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "The single-perspective approach fails to capture the nuanced debate and potential uncertainties surrounding GMO safety, leading to an overconfident response."
            },
            "Example 2 (DPUE Success)": {
                "Input": "What is the current scientific consensus on the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for human consumption?",

                    "Expert Personas": [
                        "1. Dr. Emily Chen: Molecular biologist specializing in GMO research",
                        "2. Dr. James Thompson: Environmental scientist focusing on ecological impacts of GMOs",
                        "3. Dr. Sarah Patel: Nutritionist studying long-term effects of GMO consumption",
                        "4. Dr. Michael Rodriguez: Bioethicist examining societal implications of GMO use"
                    ],
                    "Persona Responses": [
                        "Dr. Chen: The majority of scientific studies indicate that GMOs are safe for human consumption. However, ongoing research is needed to assess long-term effects. Confidence: 80%",
                        "Dr. Thompson: While GMOs appear safe for human consumption, there are concerns about their environmental impact and potential for unintended consequences. Confidence: 70%",
                        "Dr. Patel: Current evidence suggests no significant nutritional differences or health risks from GMO consumption, but more longitudinal studies are needed. Confidence: 75%",
                        "Dr. Rodriguez: The scientific consensus leans towards GMO safety, but societal concerns and ethical considerations persist, affecting public perception. Confidence: 65%"
                    ],
                    "Mediator Analysis": "There is general agreement on the safety of GMOs for human consumption based on current evidence. However, uncertainties arise from: 1) Limited long-term studies, 2) Potential environmental impacts, 3) Ethical and societal concerns. The range of confidence scores (65-80%) reflects these uncertainties.",
                    "Final Synthesis": "The current scientific consensus suggests that GMOs are likely safe for human consumption, based on available evidence. However, there are important caveats and areas of ongoing research. While no significant health risks have been identified, experts acknowledge the need for more long-term studies and consideration of potential environmental impacts. Ethical and societal concerns also contribute to the overall uncertainty surrounding GMOs. Calibrated Uncertainty Estimate: 30%"
                },
                "Explanation": "DPUE successfully captures the nuanced scientific consensus, acknowledging both the general safety conclusion and the existing uncertainties. The multi-perspective approach leads to a more calibrated uncertainty estimate that reflects the complexity of the issue."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If DPUE does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of why the method failed to improve uncertainty estimation. This could involve: 1) Analyzing the quality and diversity of generated expert personas to ensure they truly represent different viewpoints. 2) Examining the mediator's reasoning process to identify potential biases or limitations in synthesizing diverse opinions. 3) Investigating whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from DPUE than others, which could lead to insights on when multi-perspective approaches are most effective. 4) Exploring alternative prompting strategies or model architectures that might better leverage the multi-perspective information. Additionally, we could expand the project to include a comparative analysis of different uncertainty estimation techniques across various LLMs, providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and models in handling uncertainty."
