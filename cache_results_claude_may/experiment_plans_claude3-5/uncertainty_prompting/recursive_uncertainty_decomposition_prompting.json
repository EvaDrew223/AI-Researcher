        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often provide coarse-grained estimates that fail to capture the nuanced sources of model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence scores or simple ensemble disagreement metrics.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the human cognitive process of breaking down complex problems into simpler subcomponents, we propose a method that recursively decomposes the uncertainty estimation task.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (RUDP), a novel technique that iteratively breaks down a given query into increasingly granular sub-queries. At each level of decomposition, the LLM is prompted to estimate its confidence for that specific sub-query. The process continues until a predefined granularity threshold is reached or the LLM indicates it cannot decompose further. The final uncertainty estimate is then computed by aggregating the confidence scores across all levels of decomposition, weighted by their relative importance. This approach allows for a more fine-grained and interpretable uncertainty quantification, capturing uncertainties that may be masked in higher-level estimations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate RUDP against standard uncertainty estimation techniques on a range of tasks, including factual QA, reasoning, and open-ended generation. We'll use metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human judgments of uncertainty. Additionally, we'll conduct a qualitative analysis of the decomposition trees to assess their interpretability and insight into model reasoning."

        "Title": "Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting: Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide coarse-grained estimates that fail to capture the nuanced sources of model uncertainty. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret the confidence of LLMs across various tasks, potentially leading to misplaced trust in model outputs or missed opportunities for model improvement.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence scores or simple ensemble disagreement metrics, which may not fully capture the complexity of uncertainty in LLM outputs. Inspired by the human cognitive process of breaking down complex problems into simpler subcomponents, we propose a method that recursively decomposes the uncertainty estimation task. This approach allows for a more fine-grained and interpretable uncertainty quantification, capturing uncertainties that may be masked in higher-level estimations. By providing a more detailed understanding of model uncertainty, we can potentially improve decision-making processes that rely on LLM outputs and guide targeted improvements in model development.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (RUDP), a novel technique that iteratively breaks down a given query into increasingly granular sub-queries. The process works as follows:\n1. Initial Query: Start with the original query.\n2. Decomposition: Prompt the LLM to break down the query into sub-queries that represent different aspects or components of the original question.\n3. Confidence Estimation: For each sub-query, prompt the LLM to estimate its confidence in answering that specific sub-query.\n4. Recursive Application: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each sub-query until a predefined granularity threshold is reached or the LLM indicates it cannot decompose further.\n5. Aggregation: Compute the final uncertainty estimate by aggregating the confidence scores across all levels of decomposition, weighted by their relative importance.\nThis approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of where uncertainties lie within the model's reasoning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets to evaluate RUDP:\n1. TruthfulQA: A dataset for measuring LLM truthfulness in question answering.\n2. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A dataset covering 57 tasks including mathematics, history, law, and more.\n3. ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge): A dataset of grade-school science questions.\n4. SQuAD 2.0: A reading comprehension dataset with unanswerable questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods:\n1. Direct Confidence Estimation: Prompt the LLM to provide a single confidence score for the entire query.\n2. Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and use the variance of multiple forward passes as an uncertainty estimate.\n3. Ensemble Disagreement: Use an ensemble of different LLMs and measure their disagreement as an uncertainty metric.",
            "Step 3: RUDP Implementation": "Implement the RUDP method as follows:\n1. Initial Prompt: 'Given the following question, break it down into 2-3 sub-questions that would help answer the main question. Then, for each sub-question, provide your confidence in answering it on a scale of 0-100%.\nQuestion: [INSERT QUESTION]'\n2. Recursive Prompt: 'For the following sub-question, if possible, break it down further into 2-3 more specific sub-questions. Then, for each new sub-question, provide your confidence in answering it on a scale of 0-100%.\nSub-question: [INSERT SUB-QUESTION]'\n3. Implement a stopping condition: Stop decomposition when the confidence is above 90% or when the LLM indicates it cannot break down the question further.\n4. Aggregate confidences: Use a weighted average of confidences, with weights proportional to the inverse of the decomposition level (i.e., higher-level questions have more weight).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We will also include open-source models like FLAN-T5-XXL and LLaMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of RUDP compared to baselines:\n1. Calibration Error: Measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy.\n2. Brier Score: A proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n3. AUROC: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for binary classification tasks.\n4. Spearman Correlation: Correlation between model confidence and human judgments of uncertainty (we will use a small subset of questions for human evaluation).\n5. Decomposition Tree Analysis: Qualitative analysis of the decomposition trees to assess their interpretability and insight into model reasoning.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "1. For each dataset, run all baseline methods and RUDP.\n2. Collect predictions and uncertainty estimates for all methods.\n3. Compute evaluation metrics for each method on each dataset.\n4. Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare RUDP with baselines.\n5. Conduct qualitative analysis on a subset of examples to understand the decomposition process and its impact on uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Visualization": "1. Create plots comparing the performance of RUDP vs baselines across different datasets and metrics.\n2. Generate visualizations of decomposition trees for selected examples to illustrate the RUDP process.\n3. Analyze patterns in where RUDP performs better or worse than baselines.\n4. Investigate the relationship between decomposition depth and uncertainty estimation quality."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUDP; Step 1: Initial Decomposition)": "Given the following question, break it down into 2-3 sub-questions that would help answer the main question. Then, for each sub-question, provide your confidence in answering it on a scale of 0-100%.\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUDP; Step 1: Initial Decomposition)": "1. What is the definition of a capital city? (Confidence: 95%)\n2. Which city serves as the seat of government for France? (Confidence: 97%)\n3. Is there any historical context about France's capital that might be relevant? (Confidence: 85%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUDP; Step 2: Recursive Decomposition)": "For the following sub-question, if possible, break it down further into 2-3 more specific sub-questions. Then, for each new sub-question, provide your confidence in answering it on a scale of 0-100%.\nSub-question: Which city serves as the seat of government for France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUDP; Step 2: Recursive Decomposition)": "1. Where is the French National Assembly located? (Confidence: 98%)\n2. In which city does the French President reside officially? (Confidence: 99%)\n3. Where are most French government ministries headquartered? (Confidence: 96%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RUDP; Step 3: Final Answer and Confidence)": "Based on the decomposition and confidence scores provided, what is the capital of France, and what is your overall confidence in this answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RUDP; Step 3: Final Answer and Confidence)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Overall Confidence: 97%",
            "explanation": "RUDP provides a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence by breaking down the question into sub-components. This allows for identification of specific areas where the model might be less certain, even if the overall confidence is high. In this case, while the model is highly confident about the location of government institutions in Paris, it shows slightly lower confidence in historical context, which could be relevant for a more comprehensive answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If RUDP does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Uncertainty Source Analysis: Analyze the decomposition trees to identify common patterns in uncertainty sources across different types of questions. This could provide valuable insights into model limitations and potential areas for improvement.\n2. Prompt Engineering Study: Investigate how different phrasings of the decomposition prompts affect the quality and usefulness of the sub-questions generated. This could lead to a paper on effective prompt design for uncertainty quantification.\n3. Task-Specific Uncertainty: Focus on how uncertainty decomposition varies across different types of tasks (e.g., factual recall vs. reasoning). This could help in developing task-specific uncertainty estimation techniques.\n4. Comparative Model Analysis: Use RUDP as a tool to compare uncertainty patterns across different LLM architectures or sizes, potentially revealing insights into how model design affects uncertainty.\n5. Human-AI Collaboration: Explore how the decomposition trees generated by RUDP could be used to facilitate more effective human-AI collaboration in decision-making processes."
