    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often fail to capture the complex, multi-dimensional nature of model confidence across different types of tasks and knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on scalar confidence scores or basic calibration techniques that don't account for the nuanced landscape of model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Just as topological maps represent the three-dimensional features of terrain, we can create a multi-dimensional representation of a model's confidence across various knowledge domains and task types.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Topology Mapping (CTM), a novel prompting technique that constructs a high-dimensional confidence landscape. CTM works by systematically probing the model with a carefully designed set of questions that span multiple knowledge domains, task types, and difficulty levels. For each probe, we elicit not just a single confidence score, but a vector of confidences across different aspects (e.g., factual recall, logical reasoning, creative generation). These vectors are then used to construct a topological map of the model's confidence, revealing peaks, valleys, and gradients of certainty across the knowledge space. The prompting process involves asking the model to rate its confidence along multiple dimensions for each query, and to explain the rationale for its confidence ratings. This meta-cognitive process helps to reveal the model's awareness of its own knowledge boundaries and reasoning capabilities.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CTM against standard calibration techniques on a diverse set of benchmarks spanning multiple domains (e.g., science, history, math, creative writing). We'll measure not just overall calibration, but also the ability to predict task difficulty, identify knowledge boundaries, and provide interpretable explanations for confidence levels. We'll also assess the method's ability to generalize to unseen tasks and domains."

        "Title": "Confidence Topology Mapping: A Multi-Dimensional Approach to Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for quantifying uncertainty in large language models often fail to capture the complex, multi-dimensional nature of model confidence across different types of tasks and knowledge domains. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret model performance, potentially leading to misplaced trust in model outputs or missed opportunities for improvement.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on scalar confidence scores or basic calibration techniques that don't account for the nuanced landscape of model uncertainty. Just as topological maps represent the three-dimensional features of terrain, we can create a multi-dimensional representation of a model's confidence across various knowledge domains and task types. This approach allows for a more comprehensive and interpretable assessment of model uncertainty, potentially leading to better-calibrated models and more informed decision-making in AI applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Topology Mapping (CTM), a novel prompting technique that constructs a high-dimensional confidence landscape. CTM works by systematically probing the model with a carefully designed set of questions that span multiple knowledge domains, task types, and difficulty levels.

The prompting process involves asking the model to rate its confidence along multiple dimensions for each query, and to explain the rationale for its confidence ratings. This meta-cognitive process helps to reveal the model's awareness of its own knowledge boundaries and reasoning capabilities.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Prepare Datasets": "Create a diverse set of questions spanning multiple domains (e.g., science, history, math, creative writing) and task types (e.g., factual recall, logical reasoning, creative generation). Ensure a range of difficulty levels within each domain and task type. Use existing benchmarks where possible, such as TriviaQA for factual recall, MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, and WritingPrompts for creative generation. Aim for at least 1000 questions total, with balanced representation across domains and task types.",
            "Step 2: Design Confidence Dimensions": "Define a set of confidence dimensions that capture different aspects of model certainty. Examples include: 1) Factual Confidence, 2) Reasoning Confidence, 3) Source Confidence (how sure the model is about its information source), 4) Generalization Confidence (how well the model thinks its answer generalizes), and 5) Novelty Confidence (how familiar the model is with the type of question). Aim for 5-7 dimensions that cover a broad range of uncertainty aspects.",
            "Step 3: Construct CTM Prompts": "Design a prompt template that elicits multi-dimensional confidence ratings and explanations. Example: 'Question: [INSERT QUESTION HERE] Answer: [MODEL GENERATES ANSWER] Now, rate your confidence in your answer along the following dimensions on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is least confident and 10 is most confident: [LIST CONFIDENCE DIMENSIONS] For each rating, briefly explain your rationale.' Test this prompt with a few example questions to ensure it produces the desired output format.",
            "Step 4: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods as baselines: 1) Max Softmax Probability, 2) Temperature Scaling, 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation. Use these methods on the same set of questions for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Run Experiments": "Apply the CTM method and baselines to the prepared dataset using GPT-4 via the OpenAI API. For each question, collect the model's answer, the multi-dimensional confidence ratings, and the explanations for those ratings. Also collect the uncertainty estimates from the baseline methods.",
            "Step 6: Construct Confidence Topology Maps": "Using the collected multi-dimensional confidence ratings, construct visualizations of the confidence topology. Use dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP to project the high-dimensional confidence vectors into 2D or 3D space for visualization. Create heatmaps or 3D surface plots to represent the confidence landscape across different domains and task types.",
            "Step 7: Evaluate Performance": "Assess the quality of the CTM method and baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration: Compare predicted confidence with actual accuracy. 2) Sharpness: Measure the concentration of confidence distributions. 3) Correlation: Calculate the correlation between CTM confidence dimensions and task difficulty/model performance. 4) Human evaluation: Have human experts rate the quality and interpretability of the confidence explanations.",
            "Step 8: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of CTM against the baselines. Analyze how the confidence topology varies across different domains and task types. Identify areas of high and low confidence, and examine the model's explanations for these confidence ratings. Look for patterns or insights in how the model's confidence varies across different dimensions."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Answer this question, then rate your confidence in your answer along the following dimensions on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is least confident and 10 is most confident: 1) Factual Confidence, 2) Source Confidence, 3) Generalization Confidence. For each rating, briefly explain your rationale.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nConfidence Ratings:\n1) Factual Confidence: 10\nRationale: This is a widely known and undisputed fact that I'm extremely confident about.\n\n2) Source Confidence: 9\nRationale: This information comes from numerous reliable sources, including official government documents, maps, and educational materials. However, I don't have direct access to a single, definitive source, hence not a perfect 10.\n\n3) Generalization Confidence: 10\nRationale: This fact is consistent across all contexts and time periods in recent history. It generalizes well to any discussion about France or European capitals.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline method provides only a single scalar confidence score, which doesn't capture the nuances of the model's certainty. In contrast, the CTM method provides a multi-dimensional confidence assessment with explanations, offering a more comprehensive view of the model's certainty across different aspects of knowledge and reasoning."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CTM method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines in terms of calibration or interpretability, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of where and why CTM fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in self-assessing their knowledge and capabilities. This could involve clustering the types of questions where CTM performs poorly and analyzing patterns in the model's explanations for these cases. Second, we could explore variations of the CTM method, such as dynamically adjusting the confidence dimensions based on the question type, or incorporating external knowledge sources to validate the model's confidence assessments. Finally, we could shift focus to using CTM as a tool for model interpretability and error analysis, rather than as a direct improvement to uncertainty quantification. This could involve using the detailed confidence explanations to identify specific weaknesses or biases in the model's knowledge and reasoning processes, which could inform targeted improvements in model training or prompt engineering."
