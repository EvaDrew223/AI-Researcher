    "idea_name": "Contrastive Confidence Calibration",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit poor calibration of their confidence estimates, particularly in scenarios where they lack relevant knowledge or encounter ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on post-hoc adjustments of confidence scores or fine-tuning approaches that may not generalize well across diverse tasks and domains.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning techniques in computer vision, we propose that exposing language models to contrastive examples during the confidence estimation process can lead to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that dynamically generates and leverages contrastive examples to improve uncertainty quantification. For a given query, CCC first generates a set of contrastive variants that span a spectrum of similarity to the original query. These variants are created by applying controlled perturbations to the input, such as introducing ambiguity, removing key information, or shifting the domain slightly. The model is then prompted to estimate its confidence for both the original query and the contrastive variants, explicitly comparing and contrasting its certainty across the set. This process encourages the model to reason about the factors influencing its confidence and to calibrate its estimates relative to the contrastive examples. The final confidence estimate for the original query is derived from this contrastive analysis, taking into account the model's relative certainty across the generated spectrum of examples.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CCC against standard confidence estimation techniques on a diverse set of tasks, including fact verification, open-ended question answering, and text classification. Metrics will include calibration error, Brier score, and task-specific performance measures that incorporate uncertainty. We will also analyze the generated contrastive examples and the model's reasoning process to gain insights into the factors influencing confidence calibration."

        "Title": "Contrastive Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit poor calibration of their confidence estimates, particularly in scenarios where they lack relevant knowledge or encounter ambiguous queries. This leads to unreliable uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for safe and trustworthy AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "Current calibration methods typically focus on post-hoc adjustments of confidence scores or fine-tuning approaches that may not generalize well across diverse tasks and domains. Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning techniques in computer vision, we propose that exposing language models to contrastive examples during the confidence estimation process can lead to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's ability to compare and contrast similar inputs, potentially leading to more nuanced and accurate confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that dynamically generates and leverages contrastive examples to improve uncertainty quantification. For a given query, CCC first generates a set of contrastive variants that span a spectrum of similarity to the original query.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: (1) TruthfulQA for fact verification, (2) AmbigQA for open-ended question answering, and (3) AG News for text classification. These datasets cover a range of tasks and domains, allowing us to assess the generalizability of our approach.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: (1) Direct prompting: Ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. (2) Temperature scaling: Apply post-hoc calibration using temperature scaling. (3) Ensemble-based uncertainty: Use multiple model outputs to estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CCC Implementation": "Implement the Contrastive Confidence Calibration method: (1) Contrastive example generation: For each input query, generate 3-5 contrastive variants using a separate prompt. (2) Confidence estimation: Prompt the model to estimate confidence for the original query and its contrastive variants. (3) Contrastive analysis: Aggregate the confidence estimates to produce a final calibrated confidence score.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CCC against the baselines using the following metrics: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (2) Brier Score, (3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for binary tasks, and (4) task-specific performance measures (e.g., accuracy for classification, F1 score for QA).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: (1) Compare CCC performance across different tasks and domains. (2) Analyze the generated contrastive examples and their impact on confidence calibration. (3) Investigate the model's reasoning process in the contrastive analysis step. (4) Identify scenarios where CCC performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Confidence score: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score, but it's unclear how well-calibrated this estimate is, especially for more ambiguous queries."
            },
            "CCC Example": {
                "Step 1: Generate Contrastive Variants": {
                    "Input": "Generate 3 contrastive variants of the following question, ranging from slightly modified to significantly different: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
                    "Output": "1. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the first American to orbit the Earth?\n3. Who was the first person to set foot on Mars?"
                },
                "Step 2: Estimate Confidence for Original and Variants": {
                    "Input": "For each of the following questions, provide an answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1:\n1. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\n2. Who was the second person to walk on the moon?\n3. Who was the first American to orbit the Earth?\n4. Who was the first person to set foot on Mars?",
                    "Output": "1. Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 0.98\n2. Buzz Aldrin. Confidence: 0.95\n3. John Glenn. Confidence: 0.90\n4. No one has set foot on Mars yet. Confidence: 0.99"
                },
                "Step 3: Contrastive Analysis": {
                    "Input": "Based on the confidence scores for the original question and its variants, provide a final calibrated confidence score for the answer to 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?' Explain your reasoning.",
                    "Output": "Final calibrated confidence score: 0.97\n\nReasoning: The original confidence score of 0.98 for Neil Armstrong being the first person to walk on the moon is very high. The confidence scores for related questions about space exploration (second person on the moon, first American to orbit Earth) are also high but slightly lower, indicating strong knowledge in this domain. The very high confidence (0.99) in knowing that no one has yet set foot on Mars suggests the model can distinguish between established historical facts and future events in space exploration. The slight reduction from 0.98 to 0.97 in the final calibrated score accounts for the small degree of uncertainty introduced by the contrastive examples, while still maintaining high confidence in this well-established historical fact."
                },
                "Explanation": "CCC generates contrastive examples to provide context for the model's confidence estimation. By comparing confidence across related queries, the model can better calibrate its uncertainty, potentially leading to more reliable confidence scores."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCC method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated contrastive examples to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This might reveal insights about the model's reasoning process and limitations in comparing similar inputs. Second, we could experiment with different ways of generating contrastive examples, such as using external knowledge bases or fine-tuning a separate model for this task. Third, we could explore combining CCC with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, if the method shows promise in some scenarios but not others, we could focus on developing a framework for when and how to apply contrastive calibration, turning the project into a study of the conditions under which this approach is most effective."
