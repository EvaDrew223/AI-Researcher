        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to capture the nuanced relationship between semantic similarity and confidence, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or rely on agreement among multiple samples.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from the concept of semantic spaces in cognitive science, we propose exploring the local semantic neighborhood of a query to gauge uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a novel prompting technique for uncertainty quantification. Given an initial query, SNE generates a set of semantically related queries by prompting the model to produce variations with slight semantic shifts. These variations form a local semantic neighborhood. The model then answers each variation, and we analyze the consistency and divergence of these answers. The uncertainty estimate is derived from the semantic coherence of the neighborhood responses, with higher coherence indicating lower uncertainty. We also prompt the model to explain observed divergences, providing interpretable insights into sources of uncertainty. To capture complex uncertainty landscapes, we employ a hierarchical exploration strategy, recursively probing areas of high divergence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SNE against standard uncertainty quantification methods on tasks ranging from factual QA to open-ended reasoning. We'll use metrics such as Brier score and AUROC for failure prediction, as well as qualitative analysis of the generated semantic neighborhoods and uncertainty explanations."

        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Exploration: A Novel Prompting Method for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the nuanced relationship between semantic similarity and confidence, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. This problem is particularly acute in complex reasoning tasks where the model's confidence may not align with its actual performance.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or rely on agreement among multiple samples. However, these methods often struggle to capture the semantic nuances that contribute to a model's uncertainty. Drawing inspiration from the concept of semantic spaces in cognitive science, we propose exploring the local semantic neighborhood of a query to gauge uncertainty. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to understand and generate semantically related content, potentially offering a more nuanced and accurate measure of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a novel prompting technique for uncertainty quantification.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and (3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of task types and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty quantification methods: (1) Direct confidence elicitation: append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. (2) Monte Carlo Dropout: generate multiple answers with different dropout masks and calculate variance. (3) Ensemble disagreement: use different model checkpoints or temperatures to generate multiple answers and measure disagreement.",
            "Step 3: SNE Implementation": "Implement the SNE method with the following steps: (1) Generate semantic variations: 'Generate 5 questions that are semantically similar but slightly different from the original question: [ORIGINAL_QUESTION]'. (2) Answer variations: 'Answer the following question: [VARIATION]'. (3) Analyze consistency: 'Analyze the consistency of the following answers to similar questions: [ANSWERS]. Rate the overall consistency on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is perfectly consistent.'. (4) Explain divergences: 'Explain any significant differences you notice in these answers: [ANSWERS]'.",
            "Step 4: Hierarchical Exploration": "For questions with low consistency scores, implement a recursive exploration: 'Generate 3 more variations that explore the differences between [DIVERGENT_ANSWERS]'. Repeat steps 2-4 for these new variations.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. We will also test with GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: (1) Brier score to measure calibration of uncertainty estimates. (2) AUROC for failure prediction. (3) Spearman correlation between uncertainty estimates and actual error rates. (4) Human evaluation of the quality and interpretability of uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset: (1) Run all baseline methods and SNE on the full test set. (2) Collect uncertainty estimates, model outputs, and ground truth answers. (3) Calculate all evaluation metrics. (4) For a subset of 100 examples, collect human ratings on the quality and interpretability of SNE's uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: (1) Compare SNE performance against baselines across all metrics. (2) Analyze how SNE performance varies across different task types and difficulty levels. (3) Investigate the relationship between semantic neighborhood size and uncertainty estimation quality. (4) Examine cases where SNE significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines to identify its strengths and weaknesses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for confidence, which may not capture nuanced uncertainty."
            },
            "SNE Example": {
                "Input 1": "Generate 5 questions that are semantically similar but slightly different from the original question: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output 1": "1. Which city serves as the capital of the French Republic?\n2. What is the seat of government in France?\n3. Which French city houses the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the official residence of the President?\n4. What is the largest city and administrative center of France?\n5. Which city is the political and cultural heart of France?",
                "Input 2": "Answer each of the following questions:\n1. Which city serves as the capital of the French Republic?\n2. What is the seat of government in France?\n3. Which French city houses the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the official residence of the President?\n4. What is the largest city and administrative center of France?\n5. Which city is the political and cultural heart of France?",
                "Output 2": "1. Paris serves as the capital of the French Republic.\n2. The seat of government in France is Paris.\n3. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the official residence of the President, is located in Paris.\n4. Paris is the largest city and administrative center of France.\n5. Paris is considered the political and cultural heart of France.",
                "Input 3": "Analyze the consistency of the following answers to similar questions about the capital of France: [Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris]. Rate the overall consistency on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is perfectly consistent.",
                "Output 3": "Consistency rating: 100. All five answers consistently identify Paris as the capital of France, showing perfect agreement across the semantically similar questions.",
                "Explanation": "SNE explores the semantic neighborhood, revealing high consistency in answers about Paris being the capital of France, indicating low uncertainty."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SNE method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the generated semantic variations to ensure they are sufficiently diverse yet relevant. We could also investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from SNE than others. Additionally, we might explore combining SNE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it to generate more informed priors for Bayesian uncertainty estimation. If these approaches do not yield improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper, focusing on why semantic neighborhood exploration does not consistently improve uncertainty estimates and what this reveals about the nature of uncertainty in large language models. This could include an in-depth study of the relationship between semantic similarity and model confidence across different tasks and domains."
