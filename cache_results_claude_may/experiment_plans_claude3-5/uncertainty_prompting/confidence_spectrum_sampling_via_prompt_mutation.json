    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simplistic confidence scores or token probabilities, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches include using model logits, ensemble disagreement, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing, we propose that systematically mutating prompts can reveal a richer landscape of model confidence across different formulations of the same query.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Sampling via Prompt Mutation (CSSPM). Given an initial prompt, we generate a population of mutated prompts by applying various linguistic transformations (e.g., paraphrasing, restructuring, adding/removing context). We then sample model responses for each mutated prompt and analyze the distribution of outputs. The confidence spectrum is constructed by clustering similar responses and measuring inter-cluster and intra-cluster variations. This spectrum provides a nuanced view of model uncertainty, revealing areas of high confidence (stable across mutations) and low confidence (highly variant across mutations).",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CSSPM against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and logit-based uncertainty on tasks such as open-ended question answering and fact verification. Evaluate using metrics like calibration error and uncertainty ranking correlation with human judgments."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Sampling via Prompt Mutation: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic confidence scores or token probabilities, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions or misaligned confidence estimates, potentially resulting in unreliable or unsafe AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as using model logits, ensemble disagreement, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting, have shown limited success in capturing the nuanced landscape of model uncertainty. Inspired by genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing, we propose that systematically mutating prompts can reveal a richer landscape of model confidence across different formulations of the same query. This approach leverages the inherent variability in language to probe the model's confidence from multiple angles, potentially uncovering areas of uncertainty that single-prompt methods might miss.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Sampling via Prompt Mutation (CSSPM). The method works as follows: 1) Given an initial prompt, generate a population of mutated prompts by applying various linguistic transformations (e.g., paraphrasing, restructuring, adding/removing context). 2) Sample model responses for each mutated prompt. 3) Analyze the distribution of outputs by clustering similar responses and measuring inter-cluster and intra-cluster variations. 4) Construct a confidence spectrum based on the stability of responses across mutations. This spectrum provides a nuanced view of model uncertainty, revealing areas of high confidence (stable across mutations) and low confidence (highly variant across mutations).",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets that cover a range of tasks where uncertainty quantification is crucial. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for fact verification, b) AmbigQA for ambiguous question answering, and c) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement baseline uncertainty quantification methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each prompt. b) Logit-based uncertainty: Use the softmax temperature scaling of the output logits. c) Ensemble disagreement: Use different API calls or model checkpoints to create an ensemble.",
            "Step 3: CSSPM Implementation": "a) Prompt Mutation: Develop a set of mutation operators (e.g., synonym replacement, sentence restructuring, adding/removing context). For each original prompt, generate 10 mutated versions. b) Response Sampling: For each mutated prompt, sample 5 responses from the model. c) Clustering: Use a sentence embedding model (e.g., SentenceBERT) to embed responses, then apply K-means clustering. d) Confidence Spectrum Construction: Calculate intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation to quantify uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "a) Calibration Error: Compare the predicted confidence with human-annotated correctness. b) Uncertainty Ranking Correlation: Compare the ranking of questions by uncertainty with human judgments of question difficulty. c) Selective Accuracy: Plot accuracy vs. confidence threshold curves.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Visualize confidence spectra for different types of questions. b) Analyze patterns in prompt mutations that lead to high or low confidence. c) Compare CSSPM performance across different tasks and model sizes."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in my answer.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for confidence, which may not capture nuanced uncertainty."
            },
            "CSSPM Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Mutated Prompts": [
                    "What city serves as the capital of France?",
                    "Can you tell me the name of France's capital city?",
                    "Which urban center is recognized as the capital of France?",
                    "In terms of governance, what is the primary city of France?",
                    "What is the seat of government in France?"
                ],
                "Clustered Outputs": [
                    "Cluster 1 (High Confidence): Paris (5 responses)",
                    "Cluster 2 (Low Confidence): None"
                ],
                "Confidence Spectrum": "High confidence (0.95) due to consistent responses across mutations",
                "Explanation": "CSSPM reveals high confidence through consistent 'Paris' responses across varied prompts."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSSPM doesn't outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why prompt mutations don't effectively capture uncertainty. We'll investigate: 1) The nature of generated mutations - are they diverse enough? 2) The clustering process - is it capturing meaningful variations? 3) The relationship between prompt structure and model confidence. We can also explore combining CSSPM with other methods, such as using it to augment ensemble disagreement or to generate more informative prompts for direct confidence elicitation. Additionally, we could analyze how CSSPM performs across different types of questions or knowledge domains, potentially revealing insights into the model's knowledge representation and uncertainty patterns."
