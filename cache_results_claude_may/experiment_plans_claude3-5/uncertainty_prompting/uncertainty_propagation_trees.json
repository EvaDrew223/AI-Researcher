        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in complex multi-step reasoning tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect conclusions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like confidence elicitation and sample consistency focus on measuring uncertainty for single-step outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from belief propagation in probabilistic graphical models, we can decompose complex reasoning into a tree structure and propagate uncertainty through each step.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Propagation Trees (UPTs), a novel prompting method that guides LLMs to construct a tree-structured reasoning process. For each node, the model is prompted to: (1) Generate a sub-step of reasoning, (2) Estimate uncertainty for that step, and (3) Propose child nodes for further decomposition. Uncertainty is propagated upwards by combining child node uncertainties using prompted probabilistic operations. The root node's final uncertainty represents the overall confidence. Prompts are carefully designed to elicit proper tree construction, uncertainty estimation, and propagation at each step.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate UPTs against baselines like direct prompting and chain-of-thought on multi-step reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH, comparing calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error) and task performance."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Propagation Trees: Calibrating Confidence in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in complex multi-step reasoning tasks, leading to overconfidence in incorrect conclusions. This problem is particularly acute in domains requiring structured reasoning, such as mathematical problem-solving or logical deduction, where errors can propagate and compound through multiple steps.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like confidence elicitation and sample consistency primarily focus on measuring uncertainty for single-step outputs, which is insufficient for complex reasoning tasks. Drawing inspiration from belief propagation in probabilistic graphical models, we propose to decompose complex reasoning into a tree structure and propagate uncertainty through each step. This approach allows for more granular and accurate uncertainty quantification, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates and improved overall performance on multi-step reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Propagation Trees (UPTs), a novel prompting method that guides LLMs to construct a tree-structured reasoning process. For each node in the tree, the model is prompted to: (1) Generate a sub-step of reasoning, (2) Estimate uncertainty for that step, and (3) Propose child nodes for further decomposition. Uncertainty is propagated upwards by combining child node uncertainties using prompted probabilistic operations. The root node's final uncertainty represents the overall confidence. Prompts are carefully designed to elicit proper tree construction, uncertainty estimation, and propagation at each step.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the GSM8K dataset for mathematical reasoning and the MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical problem-solving. These datasets are suitable for evaluating multi-step reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting, (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and (3) Self-consistency sampling. For each baseline, we'll use a standard prompt template and record both the final answer and the model's confidence score (using a separate confidence elicitation prompt).",
            "Step 3: UPT Prompt Design": "Design a set of prompts for the UPT method, including: (1) Initial problem decomposition prompt, (2) Sub-step reasoning prompt, (3) Uncertainty estimation prompt, (4) Child node proposal prompt, and (5) Uncertainty propagation prompt. Each prompt should be designed to work with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs.",
            "Step 4: UPT Implementation": "Implement the UPT method using the designed prompts. The implementation should include: (1) Tree construction logic, (2) Recursive reasoning and uncertainty estimation for each node, (3) Uncertainty propagation mechanism, and (4) Final answer and confidence score generation.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for both baselines and UPT method on a subset of GSM8K (1000 problems) and MATH (500 problems) datasets. For each problem, record the final answer, confidence score, and intermediate reasoning steps.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (1) Accuracy: percentage of correct final answers, (2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): measure of calibration between confidence and accuracy, (3) Brier Score: quadratic scoring rule for probabilistic predictions, (4) Average Confidence: to check for overconfidence or underconfidence, (5) Tree Statistics: average depth, branching factor, and number of nodes for UPT method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis, including: (1) Comparison of accuracy and calibration metrics across methods, (2) Correlation between tree complexity and problem difficulty, (3) Qualitative analysis of reasoning paths and uncertainty propagation, (4) Error analysis to identify common failure modes and potential improvements."

            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPT; Step 1: Initial Decomposition)": "Q: If a recipe calls for 3/4 cup of sugar for 12 cookies, how much sugar is needed for 18 cookies?\nDecompose this problem into smaller sub-problems and create an initial tree structure. For each node, provide a brief description of the sub-problem and your estimated confidence (0-100%) in solving it correctly.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPT; Step 1: Initial Decomposition)": "Root: Calculate sugar needed for 18 cookies (Confidence: 90%)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Node 1: Calculate sugar per cookie (Confidence: 95%)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Node 1.1: Convert 3/4 cup to a fraction (Confidence: 99%)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Node 1.2: Divide sugar amount by 12 cookies (Confidence: 98%)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Node 2: Scale sugar amount for 18 cookies (Confidence: 93%)\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Node 2.1: Multiply sugar per cookie by 18 (Confidence: 97%)",

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPT; Step 2: Sub-step Reasoning)": "Reasoning: To calculate sugar per cookie, we need to divide the total amount of sugar by the number of cookies.\nCalculation: 3/4 cup \u00f7 12 cookies = 1/16 cup per cookie\nConfidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPT; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Given the following sub-step confidences:\nNode 1: 98%\nNode 2: 93%\nCalculate the overall confidence for the root node, explaining your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPT; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "To propagate uncertainty, we'll multiply the confidences:\n0.98 * 0.93 = 0.9114\nConverting to percentage: 91.14%\nReasoning: Multiplying probabilities represents the chance of both events occurring correctly. This gives us a more conservative estimate of our overall confidence.\nOverall confidence for root node: 91%",
            "explanation": "The UPT method provides a structured approach to decompose the problem, estimate uncertainties at each step, and propagate them to get a final confidence score. This allows for more nuanced uncertainty quantification compared to direct prompting, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the UPT method doesn't significantly improve calibration or performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why UPTs fail, focusing on the relationship between tree structure and problem difficulty. This could yield insights into the limitations of current LLMs in structured reasoning tasks. 2) Experiment with different uncertainty propagation methods, such as using more sophisticated probabilistic combination rules or learning a meta-model to combine sub-step uncertainties. 3) Investigate the impact of different prompting strategies for uncertainty elicitation, potentially uncovering better ways to extract calibrated probabilities from LLMs. 4) Extend the study to compare UPTs with human problem-solving strategies, which could provide valuable insights for cognitive science and AI alignment research."
