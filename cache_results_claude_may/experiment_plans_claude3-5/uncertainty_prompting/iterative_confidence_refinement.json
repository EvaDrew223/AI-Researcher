        "Problem": "Language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence, especially on complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on single-pass prompting or static confidence estimation techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often refine their confidence through repeated consideration and self-questioning. We can mimic this process to improve model calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Confidence Refinement (ICR), a multi-step prompting technique. Initially, the model answers the question and provides an initial confidence estimate. In subsequent steps, the model is prompted to critically examine its own reasoning, considering potential flaws or overlooked information. For example: 'You answered X with Y% confidence. What aspects of the question might you have misunderstood? What additional information could change your answer? Based on this reflection, revise your confidence if necessary.' This process is repeated for several iterations, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ICR against single-pass prompting on various reasoning tasks. Measure improvements in calibration metrics across iterations and compare final calibration against baselines."

        "Title": "Iterative Confidence Refinement: Improving Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence, especially on complex reasoning tasks. This leads to overconfident predictions on incorrect answers and underconfident predictions on correct answers, reducing the reliability and interpretability of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for confidence calibration typically rely on single-pass prompting or static confidence estimation techniques. These approaches fail to capture the nuanced process of human confidence assessment, which often involves repeated consideration and self-questioning. By mimicking this iterative process, we can potentially improve model calibration without requiring additional training data or model modifications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Confidence Refinement (ICR), a multi-step prompting technique. The process begins with the model answering the question and providing an initial confidence estimate. In subsequent steps, the model is prompted to critically examine its own reasoning, considering potential flaws or overlooked information. For example: 'You answered X with Y% confidence. What aspects of the question might you have misunderstood? What additional information could change your answer? Based on this reflection, revise your confidence if necessary.' This process is repeated for several iterations, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that involve complex reasoning and have ground truth answers. Suitable options include: TruthfulQA for assessing truthful reasoning, MMLU for multi-task language understanding, and GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for the experiments. These models are widely accessible and have shown strong performance on reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: Ask the question and request an answer with confidence. (2) Single-pass reflection: Ask the question, get an answer with confidence, then prompt once for reflection and allow a confidence update.",
            "Step 4: ICR Implementation": "Implement the Iterative Confidence Refinement method: (1) Initial response: Ask the question and get an answer with confidence. (2) Reflection: Prompt the model to reflect on potential misunderstandings or missing information. (3) Confidence update: Allow the model to update its confidence based on the reflection. (4) Repeat steps 2-3 for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 3-5) or until confidence stabilizes.",
            "Step 5: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of ICR. For example: Initial: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): [QUESTION]' Reflection: 'You answered [ANSWER] with [CONFIDENCE]% confidence. What aspects of the question might you have misunderstood? What additional information could change your answer?' Confidence update: 'Based on your reflection, would you like to update your confidence? If so, what is your new confidence level (0-100%) and why?'",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: (1) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. (2) Calibration error: Difference between confidence and accuracy. (3) Brier score: Measures both calibration and resolution. (4) Confidence distribution: Histogram of confidence scores for correct and incorrect answers.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: (1) Run the baseline methods and ICR on the entire dataset. (2) Record the final answer, confidence, and intermediate steps for ICR. (3) Calculate evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare ICR against baselines: (1) Overall performance: Compare accuracy and calibration metrics. (2) Iteration analysis: Examine how confidence changes across iterations in ICR. (3) Error analysis: Identify types of questions where ICR improves or worsens calibration. (4) Confidence distribution: Compare histograms of final confidence for correct vs. incorrect answers across methods."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ICR; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ICR; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ICR; Step 2: Reflection)": "You answered that the capital of France is Paris with 95% confidence. What aspects of the question might you have misunderstood? What additional information could change your answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ICR; Step 2: Reflection)": "Upon reflection, I don't think I misunderstood any aspects of the question. It's a straightforward factual question about the capital of France. However, some additional information that could potentially change my answer (although it's highly unlikely) would be:\n1. If the question was referring to a specific time period in history when Paris wasn't the capital.\n2. If there had been a very recent change in the French government that I'm not aware of.\n3. If the question was using 'capital' in a non-political sense, such as economic or cultural capital.\nDespite these possibilities, I still feel very confident in my answer as Paris has been the capital of France for centuries and is widely recognized as such.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ICR; Step 3: Confidence Update)": "Based on your reflection, would you like to update your confidence? If so, what is your new confidence level (0-100%) and why?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ICR; Step 3: Confidence Update)": "After reflection, I would slightly adjust my confidence level to 98%. While I initially gave 95% to allow for some small margin of error, my reflection has reinforced that this is a well-established fact with very little room for alternative interpretations or recent changes. The 2% I'm reserving is a minimal allowance for the remote possibilities mentioned in my reflection, such as a very recent, unprecedented change or a non-standard interpretation of 'capital'. This high confidence is justified by the long-standing, widely known status of Paris as the capital of France.",
            "explanation": "In this example, ICR prompts the model to reflect on its initial high-confidence answer. Through this process, the model considers potential misunderstandings or missing information, ultimately leading to a slight increase in confidence. This demonstrates how ICR can help refine confidence estimates, even for seemingly straightforward questions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ICR doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the reflection process: Examine the types of reflections generated and how they relate to confidence changes. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning process and potential limitations. 2) Investigate prompt variations: Test different phrasings for the reflection and confidence update prompts to see if certain formulations are more effective. 3) Explore task-specific calibration: Analyze how ICR performs across different types of questions (e.g., factual recall vs. complex reasoning) to identify where it's most effective. 4) Combine with other techniques: Integrate ICR with other calibration methods, such as temperature scaling or ensemble approaches, to see if hybrid methods yield better results. 5) Focus on interpretability: Even if calibration doesn't improve significantly, the reflection process in ICR could provide valuable insights into model decision-making, potentially turning this into a study on LLM interpretability."
