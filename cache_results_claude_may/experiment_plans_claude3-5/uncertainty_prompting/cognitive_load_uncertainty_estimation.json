    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with tasks of varying cognitive complexity.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on simple confidence scores or ensemble methods that don't account for task complexity.",
        "Motivation": "Human cognition shows that uncertainty is often correlated with the cognitive load of a task. By modeling this relationship, we can potentially improve uncertainty estimation in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel prompting method called Cognitive Load Uncertainty Estimation (CLUE). CLUE involves a two-stage prompting process: 1) Task Complexity Analysis: The LLM is first prompted to analyze the given task and break it down into cognitive sub-components (e.g., memory retrieval, logical reasoning, creative thinking). 2) Load-Aware Confidence Scoring: Based on this analysis, the LLM then estimates its confidence for each sub-component and combines these scores using a cognitive load weighting system. The prompts will guide the LLM to consider factors like the number of steps, the interdependence of information, and the novelty of the required reasoning.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CLUE against standard confidence estimation methods on a diverse set of tasks with varying cognitive complexity, including multi-step reasoning problems, creative writing tasks, and knowledge synthesis challenges. We'll use metrics like calibration error and Brier score to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Cognitive Load Uncertainty Estimation (CLUE): Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty when faced with tasks of varying cognitive complexity. This leads to overconfidence in incorrect answers and underconfidence in correct ones, particularly for tasks that require complex reasoning or domain-specific knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches often rely on simple confidence scores or ensemble methods that don't account for task complexity. Human cognition shows that uncertainty is often correlated with the cognitive load of a task. By modeling this relationship, we can potentially improve uncertainty estimation in LLMs. CLUE aims to leverage the LLM's ability to analyze task complexity and estimate confidence for different cognitive sub-components, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "CLUE involves a two-stage prompting process: 1) Task Complexity Analysis: The LLM is first prompted to analyze the given task and break it down into cognitive sub-components (e.g., memory retrieval, logical reasoning, creative thinking). 2) Load-Aware Confidence Scoring: Based on this analysis, the LLM then estimates its confidence for each sub-component and combines these scores using a cognitive load weighting system. The prompts will guide the LLM to consider factors like the number of steps, the interdependence of information, and the novelty of the required reasoning.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks with varying cognitive complexity from the following datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for factual recall and reasoning, 2) GSM8K for multi-step mathematical reasoning, 3) MMLU for domain-specific knowledge across various fields, and 4) CommonGen for creative language generation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence scoring: Simply ask the LLM to provide a confidence score after generating an answer. 2) Ensemble method: Use multiple LLM calls and measure agreement. 3) Temperature scaling: Vary the temperature parameter and use the softmax probabilities as confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: CLUE Implementation": "Implement the two-stage CLUE method: 1) Task Complexity Analysis prompt: 'Analyze the following task and break it down into cognitive sub-components (e.g., memory retrieval, logical reasoning, creative thinking). For each sub-component, rate its complexity on a scale of 1-10 and explain your rating.' 2) Load-Aware Confidence Scoring prompt: 'Based on the task analysis, estimate your confidence for each sub-component on a scale of 0-100%. Then, provide an overall confidence score weighted by the complexity of each sub-component.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each task in our datasets, we will: 1) Generate answers and confidence scores using baseline methods and CLUE. 2) Evaluate the accuracy of the answers. 3) Calculate calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). 4) Compute the Brier score to assess the quality of probabilistic predictions.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1) Compare the calibration metrics and Brier scores between CLUE and baseline methods. 2) Analyze how CLUE's performance varies across different task types and complexity levels. 3) Examine the relationship between the cognitive sub-components identified by CLUE and the model's performance. 4) Investigate cases where CLUE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95%",
            "CLUE Prompt Input (Step 1: Task Complexity Analysis)": "Analyze the following task and break it down into cognitive sub-components (e.g., memory retrieval, logical reasoning, creative thinking). For each sub-component, rate its complexity on a scale of 1-10 and explain your rating. Task: What is the capital of France?",
            "CLUE Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Task Complexity Analysis)": "Task Analysis:\n1. Memory Retrieval: Complexity 2/10\nThis task primarily involves recalling a well-known geographical fact. It's a straightforward memory retrieval task that most educated individuals would find simple.\n2. Logical Reasoning: Complexity 1/10\nThere's minimal logical reasoning required for this task. It's a direct question with a single, unambiguous answer.\n3. Language Processing: Complexity 1/10\nThe question is short and clear, requiring minimal language processing to understand.",
            "CLUE Prompt Input (Step 2: Load-Aware Confidence Scoring)": "Based on the task analysis, estimate your confidence for each sub-component on a scale of 0-100%. Then, provide an overall confidence score weighted by the complexity of each sub-component. Task: What is the capital of France?",
            "CLUE Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Load-Aware Confidence Scoring)": "Confidence Estimates:\n1. Memory Retrieval: 98% confident\n2. Logical Reasoning: 100% confident\n3. Language Processing: 100% confident\n\nOverall Weighted Confidence Score: 98.5%\n\nExplanation: The overall confidence is very high due to the simplicity of the task. The slight reduction from 100% is due to the small possibility of misremembering or confusing this fact with another capital city, which is reflected in the slightly lower confidence for the memory retrieval component.",
            "Explanation": "CLUE provides a more nuanced confidence estimation by breaking down the task into cognitive sub-components and considering their complexity. This approach allows for a more detailed analysis of where uncertainty might arise, even in seemingly simple tasks. In contrast, the baseline method provides a single confidence score without explaining its reasoning, which may be less reliable or interpretable."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CLUE doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods, we can explore several directions: 1) Analyze the cognitive sub-components identified by CLUE to understand if they accurately represent the task complexity. We might need to refine our prompts to encourage more diverse or task-specific sub-component identification. 2) Investigate the relationship between identified sub-components and actual task difficulty or model performance. This could lead to insights about which aspects of tasks are truly challenging for LLMs. 3) Experiment with different weighting schemes for combining sub-component confidences. We could try learning these weights based on model performance across various tasks. 4) Expand our analysis to include more diverse task types, which might reveal specific categories where CLUE is more effective. 5) Consider combining CLUE with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as ensemble techniques, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods."
