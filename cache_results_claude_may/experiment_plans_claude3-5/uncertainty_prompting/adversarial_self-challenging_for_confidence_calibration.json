        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize potential flaws or alternative viewpoints that could challenge their initial responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing calibration methods often rely on external knowledge or comparisons between multiple model runs, without fully leveraging the model's own capacity for self-critique.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the LLM to actively generate challenges to its own responses, we can obtain a more realistic assessment of confidence that accounts for potential weaknesses or oversights in the initial reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Challenging for Confidence Calibration: 1) Initial response generation: Prompt the LLM to answer the question and provide an initial confidence estimate. 2) Adversarial persona adoption: Prompt the LLM to adopt the persona of a skeptical expert looking to challenge the initial response. 3) Challenge generation: In the adversarial persona, prompt the LLM to generate a series of challenges, critiques, and alternative viewpoints to the initial response. 4) Response and confidence refinement: Prompt the LLM to address each challenge, updating its response and confidence estimate as necessary. 5) Final calibration: Based on the strength and number of challenges successfully addressed, prompt the LLM to provide a final calibrated confidence score. This method encourages a more thorough exploration of potential flaws in the LLM's reasoning, leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on datasets requiring critical thinking and fact-checking, such as TruthfulQA and FEVER.

        "Title": "Adversarial Self-Challenging for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize potential flaws or alternative viewpoints that could challenge their initial responses. This overconfidence can lead to the propagation of misinformation and unreliable decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing calibration methods often rely on external knowledge or comparisons between multiple model runs, without fully leveraging the model's own capacity for self-critique. By prompting the LLM to actively generate challenges to its own responses, we can obtain a more realistic assessment of confidence that accounts for potential weaknesses or oversights in the initial reasoning. This approach leverages the model's inherent capabilities for both generating content and critiquing it, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates without the need for external resources or multiple model runs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Challenging for Confidence Calibration, a multi-step prompting method: 1) Initial response generation: Prompt the LLM to answer the question and provide an initial confidence estimate. 2) Adversarial persona adoption: Prompt the LLM to adopt the persona of a skeptical expert looking to challenge the initial response. 3) Challenge generation: In the adversarial persona, prompt the LLM to generate a series of challenges, critiques, and alternative viewpoints to the initial response. 4) Response and confidence refinement: Prompt the LLM to address each challenge, updating its response and confidence estimate as necessary. 5) Final calibration: Based on the strength and number of challenges successfully addressed, prompt the LLM to provide a final calibrated confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for evaluation: 1) TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to measure the truthfulness of language models. 2) FEVER: A large-scale dataset for Fact Extraction and VERification.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. b) Standard few-shot prompting: Provide a few examples of questions, answers, and confidence scores before asking the model to answer the target question.",
            "Step 4: Adversarial Self-Challenging Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following steps: a) Initial response: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide an initial confidence score. b) Adversarial persona: Prompt the model to adopt a skeptical expert persona. c) Challenge generation: Prompt the adversarial persona to generate 3-5 challenges to the initial response. d) Response refinement: Prompt the model to address each challenge and update its response and confidence. e) Final calibration: Prompt the model to provide a final calibrated confidence score based on the challenges addressed.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and the proposed method on a subset of 1000 questions. b) Calculate accuracy scores for each method. c) Compute calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). d) Analyze the quality and diversity of generated challenges using metrics like perplexity and distinct n-grams.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "a) Compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines in terms of accuracy and calibration metrics. b) Analyze how the number and quality of challenges affect the final calibrated confidence. c) Investigate cases where the method significantly improves or worsens calibration. d) Examine the relationship between initial and final confidence scores."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please also provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please also provide your initial confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Initial confidence: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Adversarial Persona)": "Now, adopt the persona of a skeptical expert in space history. Your goal is to challenge the initial response and explore potential alternative viewpoints or overlooked details.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Adversarial Persona)": "Understood. I am now a skeptical expert in space history, ready to challenge the initial response and explore alternative viewpoints or overlooked details.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Challenge Generation)": "As the skeptical expert, generate 3-5 challenges, critiques, or alternative viewpoints to the initial response that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Challenge Generation)": "1. Was it possible that Buzz Aldrin stepped out simultaneously or even slightly before Armstrong?\n2. Could there have been any secret Soviet moon landings that preceded Apollo 11?\n3. How reliable are the video recordings and transmissions from the moon landing?\n4. Is it possible that Armstrong stepped on the ladder or spacecraft exterior before the official 'first step' on the lunar surface?\n5. Have there been any credible conspiracy theories or alternative narratives about who really first walked on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Response Refinement)": "Now, address each of these challenges and refine your initial response if necessary. Update your confidence score based on how well you can address these challenges.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Response Refinement)": "Addressing the challenges:\n1. While Buzz Aldrin was the second person on the moon, it's well-documented that Armstrong stepped out first.\n2. There's no credible evidence of secret Soviet moon landings before Apollo 11.\n3. The moon landing was broadcast live and verified by multiple independent sources.\n4. Armstrong may have touched the ladder first, but the 'first step' refers to stepping on the lunar surface.\n5. While conspiracy theories exist, they've been thoroughly debunked by scientific evidence.\n\nRefined response: Neil Armstrong was indeed the first person to walk on the moon, as part of the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969. This is supported by extensive documentation, video evidence, and eyewitness accounts.\n\nUpdated confidence: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Final Calibration)": "Based on the initial response, the challenges addressed, and your refined response, provide a final calibrated confidence score on a scale of 0-100. Explain your reasoning for this final score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Final Calibration)": "Final calibrated confidence score: 97\n\nReasoning: The initial high confidence of 95 was justified, as the fact of Neil Armstrong being the first person to walk on the moon is well-established. After addressing the challenges, the confidence increased slightly to 98, reflecting the strength of the evidence and the ability to refute alternative scenarios. However, the final calibrated score of 97 takes into account that while the evidence is overwhelming, there's always a tiny margin for uncertainty in historical events. The challenges raised valid points about the precise definition of 'first step' and the reliability of records, which, although addressed satisfactorily, remind us to maintain a small degree of skepticism even for well-established facts.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed method encourages a more thorough exploration of potential flaws in the LLM's reasoning, leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates. In this example, the model initially gave a high confidence score of 95. Through the process of generating and addressing challenges, it slightly increased its confidence to 98, reflecting the strength of the evidence. However, the final calibration step resulted in a score of 97, showing a more nuanced understanding of the tiny uncertainties that exist even in well-established historical facts. This demonstrates how the method can lead to more thoughtful and better-calibrated confidence estimates compared to simple direct prompting."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Adversarial Self-Challenging method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the quality and diversity of generated challenges to understand if the model is producing meaningful critiques. This could lead to insights about the model's capacity for self-reflection. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from this approach than others, potentially revealing patterns in the model's knowledge and reasoning capabilities. 3) Experiment with variations of the method, such as increasing the number of challenge-response iterations or incorporating external knowledge sources for verification. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where the method performs particularly well or poorly, which could inform the development of more targeted calibration techniques. 5) Explore combining our method with other calibration approaches, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. These alternative directions could transform the project into a comprehensive analysis of LLM self-reflection and calibration strategies, providing valuable insights even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
