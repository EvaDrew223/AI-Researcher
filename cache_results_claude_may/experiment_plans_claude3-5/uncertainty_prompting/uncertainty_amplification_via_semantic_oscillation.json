    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that require nuanced understanding.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct prompting for confidence scores or use ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of constructive interference in physics, we hypothesize that intentionally inducing semantic oscillations in the model's reasoning process could amplify underlying uncertainties and make them more detectable.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique called Semantic Oscillation Uncertainty Amplification (SOUA). SOUA involves a multi-step process: 1) Initial query processing, 2) Generation of semantically varied rephrases of the query, each slightly altering the focus or perspective, 3) Parallel processing of these rephrases, 4) Analysis of response variations to quantify uncertainty. The prompt instructs the model to generate these semantic variations and then compare its own responses, explicitly noting areas of consistency and divergence. The degree of divergence in responses to semantically similar queries serves as a measure of the model's underlying uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SOUA against standard confidence estimation techniques on benchmark datasets for question-answering and fact verification tasks. We'll measure performance using calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score, as well as task-specific accuracy metrics."

        "Title": "Semantic Oscillation Uncertainty Amplification: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Induced Reasoning Variations",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex queries that require nuanced understanding. This issue is particularly pronounced in tasks involving multi-step reasoning or ambiguous information, where models may confidently produce incorrect answers or fail to acknowledge their limitations.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as direct prompting for confidence scores or ensemble methods, often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of model uncertainty. These approaches may not adequately reflect the model's underlying reasoning process or capture subtle variations in understanding. Inspired by the concept of constructive interference in physics, we hypothesize that intentionally inducing semantic oscillations in the model's reasoning process could amplify underlying uncertainties and make them more detectable. This approach leverages the model's own capacity for generating diverse perspectives to reveal its inherent uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Oscillation Uncertainty Amplification (SOUA), a novel prompting technique designed to quantify uncertainty in large language models. SOUA involves a multi-step process: 1) Initial query processing, 2) Generation of semantically varied rephrases of the query, each slightly altering the focus or perspective, 3) Parallel processing of these rephrases, 4) Analysis of response variations to quantify uncertainty. The prompt instructs the model to generate these semantic variations and then compare its own responses, explicitly noting areas of consistency and divergence. The degree of divergence in responses to semantically similar queries serves as a measure of the model's underlying uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select benchmark datasets for question-answering and fact verification tasks. We will use the following datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for fact verification, 2) AmbigQA for ambiguous questions, and 3) StrategyQA for multi-step reasoning questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: a) Direct confidence prompting: Ask the model to provide a confidence score along with its answer. b) Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs and calculate variance in outputs. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and calculate prediction variance.",
            "Step 3: SOUA Implementation": "Implement the SOUA method with the following steps: a) Initial query processing: Pass the original question to the model. b) Semantic variation generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 semantically varied rephrases of the original question. c) Parallel processing: Process each variation independently. d) Response analysis: Compare responses to identify consistencies and divergences.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of SOUA. For example: 1) Initial query: 'Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]' 2) Semantic variation: 'Generate 3 alternative ways to ask the following question, each slightly changing the perspective or focus: [QUESTION]' 3) Parallel processing: 'Please answer the following question: [VARIED_QUESTION]' 4) Response analysis: 'Compare the following answers to semantically similar questions. Identify areas of consistency and divergence: [LIST_OF_ANSWERS]'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) b) Brier Score c) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) d) Task-specific accuracy metrics for each dataset",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results b) Run SOUA method and collect results c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and SOUA results",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform comparative analysis: a) Compare SOUA performance against baselines across all metrics b) Analyze the relationship between semantic variation divergence and task difficulty c) Investigate cases where SOUA significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of: a) Number of semantic variations b) Complexity of the semantic variation prompt c) Method of aggregating variation responses"
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 1 for your answer.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method directly asks for a confidence score, which may not accurately reflect true uncertainty, especially for more complex questions."
            },
            "SOUA Example": {
                "Step 1: Initial Query": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 2: Semantic Variations": "1. Which city serves as the governmental center of France?\n2. What is the most populous and politically significant city in France?\n3. If you were to visit the seat of French national government, which city would you go to?",
                "Step 3: Parallel Processing": "(Answers to each variation)\n1. Paris serves as the governmental center of France.\n2. Paris is the most populous and politically significant city in France.\n3. To visit the seat of French national government, you would go to Paris.",
                "Step 4: Response Analysis": "All three variations consistently point to Paris as the capital of France. There is no divergence in the responses, indicating high certainty in the answer.",
                "Explanation": "SOUA generates multiple perspectives on the same question, processes them in parallel, and analyzes the consistency of responses. This approach can better capture nuanced uncertainties, especially for more complex queries where direct confidence estimation might fail."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SOUA does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will pivot to an in-depth analysis of the semantic variations generated and their impact on model responses. This analysis could reveal insights into how LLMs interpret and rephrase questions, and how slight variations in question framing affect their responses. We will investigate patterns in the generated variations, categorizing them based on the type of semantic change (e.g., perspective shift, specificity alteration, context addition) and analyze how each category impacts the model's certainty and accuracy. Additionally, we will explore using SOUA as a data augmentation technique for fine-tuning smaller models on uncertainty quantification tasks. This approach could turn the project into a study on improving model robustness and calibration through semantically diverse training data."
