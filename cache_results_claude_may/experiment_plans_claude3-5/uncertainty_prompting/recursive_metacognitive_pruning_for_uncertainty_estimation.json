        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to identify the specific sources of their uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates.",

        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Metacognitive Pruning (RMP), a multi-step prompting process: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score. 2) Identify potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous terms, missing context, conflicting information). 3) For each source, attempt to resolve the uncertainty through further reasoning or retrieval. 4) Prune resolved sources and update the confidence score. 5) Repeat steps 2-4 until no further resolution is possible or a confidence threshold is reached. 6) Provide a final response, confidence score, and explanation of remaining uncertainties.

        "Title": "Recursive Metacognitive Pruning: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately identify and quantify their sources of uncertainty, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and hinder the effective use of LLMs in critical applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on generating a single confidence score without explicitly identifying the sources of uncertainty. This approach fails to capture the nuanced nature of model uncertainty and limits the interpretability of confidence estimates. By recursively examining and pruning potential sources of uncertainty, we can achieve a more precise and well-calibrated estimate of model confidence. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we iteratively reflect on our knowledge and uncertainties to refine our confidence in a given answer.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Recursive Metacognitive Pruning (RMP), a multi-step prompting process for improving uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The RMP method consists of the following steps: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score. 2) Identify potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous terms, missing context, conflicting information). 3) For each source, attempt to resolve the uncertainty through further reasoning or retrieval. 4) Prune resolved sources and update the confidence score. 5) Repeat steps 2-4 until no further resolution is possible or a confidence threshold is reached. 6) Provide a final response, confidence score, and explanation of remaining uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and uncertainty, 2) AmbigQA for handling ambiguous questions, and 3) MultiNLI for evaluating reasoning under uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with a request for a confidence score, 2) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation, and 3) Ensemble-based uncertainty quantification using multiple LLM samples.",
            "Step 3: RMP Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Metacognitive Pruning method using the following prompts for each step: 1) Initial response: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' 2) Identify uncertainties: 'List potential sources of uncertainty in your previous answer:' 3) Resolve uncertainties: 'Attempt to resolve the following uncertainty: [UNCERTAINTY]' 4) Update confidence: 'Based on the resolved uncertainties, update your confidence score:' 5) Final response: 'Provide your final answer, confidence score, and explanation of remaining uncertainties:'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of RMP compared to baselines: 1) Calibration error (difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy), 2) Brier score (for probabilistic predictions), 3) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for uncertainty detection, and 4) Human evaluation of uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run baseline methods and collect results. 2) Run RMP method with a maximum of 3 recursive steps. 3) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and RMP. 4) Conduct statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare RMP performance against baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare RMP performance against baselines across different datasets and models. 2) Analyze the types of uncertainties identified and resolved by RMP. 3) Evaluate the impact of the number of recursive steps on performance. 4) Assess the quality and interpretability of uncertainty explanations provided by RMP."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "RMP Prompt Input (Step 1)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "RMP Prompt Expected Output (Step 1)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "RMP Prompt Input (Step 2)": "List potential sources of uncertainty in your previous answer:",
            "RMP Prompt Expected Output (Step 2)": "1. Historical changes: The capital might have changed in recent times.\n2. Definition of 'capital': There could be multiple types of capitals (e.g., administrative, cultural).\n3. Potential recent geopolitical events: Major changes might have occurred that I'm not aware of.",
            "RMP Prompt Input (Step 3)": "Attempt to resolve the following uncertainty: Historical changes: The capital might have changed in recent times.",
            "RMP Prompt Expected Output (Step 3)": "After consideration, I can confidently state that there have been no recent historical changes to the capital of France. Paris has been the capital of France since 987 AD and remains so to this day. This uncertainty can be resolved.",
            "RMP Prompt Input (Step 4)": "Based on the resolved uncertainties, update your confidence score:",
            "RMP Prompt Expected Output (Step 4)": "Updated confidence score: 98. The resolution of the historical changes uncertainty increases my confidence in the answer.",
            "RMP Prompt Input (Final Step)": "Provide your final answer, confidence score, and explanation of remaining uncertainties:",
            "RMP Prompt Expected Output (Final Step)": "Final answer: The capital of France is Paris.\nConfidence score: 98\nExplanation of remaining uncertainties: While I'm highly confident in this answer, there are two minor sources of uncertainty:\n1. Definition of 'capital': There could be multiple types of capitals, but Paris is generally recognized as the primary capital in all aspects.\n2. Potential recent geopolitical events: While highly unlikely, there's a minimal chance of very recent changes that I'm not aware of. However, such a significant change would likely be widely known and reported.",
            "Explanation": "The RMP method provides a more nuanced and well-calibrated confidence estimate compared to the baseline. It explicitly identifies and attempts to resolve sources of uncertainty, leading to a slightly higher confidence score (98 vs 95) with a clear explanation of the remaining uncertainties. This process allows for better interpretability and a more accurate representation of the model's true confidence in its answer."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RMP method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This analysis will focus on: 1) Examining the types of uncertainties identified by the model and whether they are relevant and comprehensive. 2) Assessing the quality of the model's attempts to resolve uncertainties. 3) Investigating whether the recursive process is effectively pruning and updating confidence scores. Based on these findings, we may modify the RMP method, such as by incorporating external knowledge sources for uncertainty resolution or developing a more structured approach to identifying uncertainty types. Additionally, we could explore combining RMP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple strategies. If these modifications don't yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of why current LLMs struggle with metacognitive tasks and uncertainty quantification, potentially providing insights for future model development and training strategies."
