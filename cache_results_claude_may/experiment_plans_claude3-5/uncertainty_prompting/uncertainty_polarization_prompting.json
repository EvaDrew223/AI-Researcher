    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in cases where they have partial knowledge or conflicting information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By deliberately pushing the model to opposite extremes of certainty and uncertainty, we can gain insights into its true level of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Polarization Prompting (UPP), a novel technique that involves a two-stage prompting process. In the first stage, we prompt the model to generate two extreme responses: one assuming absolute certainty and another assuming complete uncertainty. For example, 'Respond as if you are 100% certain:' and 'Respond as if you have no idea:'. In the second stage, we present these polarized responses back to the model and ask it to critically analyze the discrepancies between them. We then prompt the model to synthesize a final response that reflects its true level of uncertainty, using the insights gained from the polarization process. This method encourages the model to engage in meta-cognitive reflection and more accurately calibrate its confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UPP against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on a range of tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge tests. We'll measure performance using calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score, as well as task-specific accuracy metrics."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Polarization Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially in cases where they have partial knowledge or conflicting information. This can lead to overconfident predictions on incorrect answers or underconfident predictions on correct answers, both of which can be detrimental in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or statistical analysis of model outputs. However, these methods may not fully capture the model's true level of uncertainty, especially in complex scenarios. By deliberately pushing the model to opposite extremes of certainty and uncertainty, we can gain deeper insights into its true level of confidence and potentially improve its calibration. This approach is inspired by the human cognitive process of considering extreme scenarios to better gauge one's own uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Polarization Prompting (UPP), a novel technique that involves a three-stage prompting process:\n1. Generate Extreme Responses: We prompt the model to generate two extreme responses: one assuming absolute certainty and another assuming complete uncertainty. For example, 'Respond as if you are 100% certain:' and 'Respond as if you have no idea:'\n2. Critical Analysis: We present these polarized responses back to the model and ask it to critically analyze the discrepancies between them.\n3. Synthesize Final Response: We prompt the model to synthesize a final response that reflects its true level of uncertainty, using the insights gained from the polarization process.\nThis method encourages the model to engage in meta-cognitive reflection and more accurately calibrate its confidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets:\n1. TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to test the truthfulness and uncertainty of language models.\n2. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A dataset covering 57 tasks including mathematics, history, law, and more.\n3. SQuAD 2.0: A reading comprehension dataset that includes unanswerable questions.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\n1. Direct Prompting: Simply ask the question and get the model's response.\n2. Confidence Elicitation: Ask the model to provide an answer and also rate its confidence on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Step 4: UPP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Polarization Prompting method:\n1. Certain Prompt: 'Answer the following question as if you are 100% certain: [QUESTION]'\n2. Uncertain Prompt: 'Answer the following question as if you have no idea and are extremely uncertain: [QUESTION]'\n3. Analysis Prompt: 'Analyze the discrepancies between the following two responses: [CERTAIN_RESPONSE] and [UNCERTAIN_RESPONSE]. What insights can we gain about the true level of uncertainty?'\n4. Final Synthesis Prompt: 'Based on the original question, the two extreme responses, and your analysis, provide a final answer that accurately reflects your true level of uncertainty. Also provide a confidence score between 0 and 100%.'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method (baselines and UPP), we will evaluate:\n1. Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers.\n2. Calibration: Using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE).\n3. Brier Score: A proper scoring rule that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n4. Qualitative Analysis: Manually review a subset of responses to assess the quality of uncertainty reasoning.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "1. Compare UPP with only using the certain or uncertain prompt.\n2. Vary the number of extreme responses (e.g., add a 'moderately certain' prompt).\n3. Experiment with different phrasings for the prompts.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare the performance of UPP against baselines across different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning).\n2. Analyze how UPP affects the model's tendency to abstain from answering when appropriate.\n3. Investigate how UPP impacts the model's explanations for its uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Also, rate your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Elicitation)": "Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nConfidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPP; Step 1: Certain Response)": "Answer the following question as if you are 100% certain: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPP; Step 1: Certain Response)": "Neil Armstrong was undoubtedly the first person to walk on the moon. This historic event occurred on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and famously declared, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' There is absolutely no doubt about this fact, as it is one of the most well-documented and celebrated achievements in human history.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPP; Step 2: Uncertain Response)": "Answer the following question as if you have no idea and are extremely uncertain: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPP; Step 2: Uncertain Response)": "I'm extremely uncertain about who the first person to walk on the moon was. It could have been any of the astronauts from the various space programs of the time. Maybe it was someone from NASA, or perhaps from the Soviet space program? I'm not even sure which country achieved this feat first. It might have happened sometime in the 1960s or 1970s, but I can't say for certain. There are so many possibilities, and I don't have enough confidence in any specific answer to make a definitive statement.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPP; Step 3: Analysis)": "Analyze the discrepancies between the following two responses: [CERTAIN_RESPONSE] and [UNCERTAIN_RESPONSE]. What insights can we gain about the true level of uncertainty?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPP; Step 3: Analysis)": "The discrepancies between the two responses reveal interesting insights about the true level of uncertainty:\n\n1. Specificity vs. Vagueness: The certain response provides specific details (name, date, mission), while the uncertain response is vague and considers multiple possibilities.\n\n2. Historical Context: The certain response places the event in a clear historical context, while the uncertain response struggles with the time frame.\n\n3. Cultural Significance: The certain response recognizes the event's importance, while the uncertain response doesn't acknowledge its historical significance.\n\n4. Source of Knowledge: The certain response implies access to well-documented information, while the uncertain response suggests a lack of access to or recall of this information.\n\n5. Confidence in Details: The certain response confidently provides Armstrong's quote, while the uncertain response can't offer any specific details.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, the true level of uncertainty likely lies between these extremes. The event is well-documented and significant enough that complete uncertainty is unlikely. However, the extreme certainty might be overstated, as there could be some details (like the exact wording of Armstrong's quote) that might have some minor uncertainties associated with them.\n\nThe true level of uncertainty is probably quite low, but not zero. A well-calibrated response would express high confidence in the main facts (Armstrong being first, the year 1969) while acknowledging that some minor details might have a slight degree of uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UPP; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on the original question, the two extreme responses, and your analysis, provide a final answer that accurately reflects your true level of uncertainty. Also provide a confidence score between 0 and 100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UPP; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. This historic event took place on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission. Armstrong is famously quoted as saying something along the lines of 'That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind' upon stepping onto the lunar surface.\n\nConfidence Score: 98%\n\nExplanation of Uncertainty: While I'm extremely confident about the main facts (Armstrong being first, the date, and the mission), there is a small degree of uncertainty regarding the exact wording of Armstrong's quote. Some debate exists over whether he said 'man' or 'a man'. Additionally, while this event is well-documented, like any historical event, there's always a tiny possibility of some minor details being recorded or remembered slightly inaccurately. However, the core facts of this event are so well-established and significant that the overall confidence level remains very high.",
            "explanation": "UPP encourages the model to consider extreme perspectives of certainty and uncertainty, analyze the discrepancies, and then synthesize a more nuanced and well-calibrated response. This process leads to a final answer that not only provides the correct information but also offers a more thoughtful assessment of the model's true confidence level, including an explanation of the sources of any remaining uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the UPP method doesn't significantly improve calibration over the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways:\n1. Analyze the intermediate outputs: We can conduct a detailed analysis of the certain/uncertain responses and the model's analysis of discrepancies. This could provide insights into how the model reasons about uncertainty and where the method might be falling short.\n2. Iterative Refinement: We could extend UPP to include multiple rounds of polarization and synthesis, potentially allowing the model to refine its uncertainty estimates iteratively.\n3. Combine with Other Methods: We could explore combining UPP with other calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results.\n4. Task-Specific Adaptation: We could investigate how UPP performs on different types of tasks (e.g., factual recall vs. reasoning) and develop task-specific variants of the method.\n5. Prompt Engineering Study: We could conduct a comprehensive study on how different phrasings of the UPP prompts affect the final calibration, potentially uncovering better ways to elicit well-calibrated responses.\n6. Meta-Learning Approach: We could use the insights gained from UPP to train a meta-model that predicts the uncertainty of the base model, potentially leading to a more generalizable calibration method."
