    "idea_name": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Compression",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their responses, especially for complex queries that require distilling large amounts of information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches focus on direct uncertainty estimation or confidence calibration without considering the information density of the input prompt.",
        "Motivation": "By compressing the input prompt to its most salient features, we can reduce noise and focus the model's attention on key information, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting method: 1) Prompt Compression: Given an input query, we first prompt the LLM to generate a compressed version that retains only the most relevant information. 2) Uncertainty Estimation: We then use this compressed prompt to generate both an answer and an uncertainty estimate. The compression step forces the model to identify and focus on the most crucial aspects of the query, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification. We can further refine this process by iteratively compressing and expanding the prompt, each time asking the model to reassess its uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare our method against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification techniques on various question-answering and reasoning tasks. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, Brier score, and task-specific performance measures."

        "Title": "Compressed Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their responses, especially for complex queries that require distilling large amounts of information. This issue is particularly pronounced when dealing with inputs that contain a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, potentially leading to overconfident or miscalibrated predictions.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically focus on direct uncertainty estimation or confidence calibration without considering the information density of the input prompt. By compressing the input prompt to its most salient features, we can potentially reduce noise and focus the model's attention on key information, leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where experts often distill complex problems into their core components before making judgments about their confidence in a solution.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting method called Compressed Uncertainty Quantification (CUQ): 1) Prompt Compression: Given an input query, we first prompt the LLM to generate a compressed version that retains only the most relevant information. 2) Uncertainty Estimation: We then use this compressed prompt to generate both an answer and an uncertainty estimate. The compression step forces the model to identify and focus on the most crucial aspects of the query, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification. We can further refine this process by iteratively compressing and expanding the prompt, each time asking the model to reassess its uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) TriviaQA for factual question answering, 2) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, and 3) BoolQ for yes/no questions. These datasets cover a range of task types and complexities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement the following baselines: a) Direct prompting with uncertainty estimation, b) Monte Carlo Dropout, c) Ensemble of models, d) Temperature scaling.",
            "Step 3: Implement CUQ": "For each query in the datasets: 1) Prompt the LLM to compress the query, 2) Use the compressed query to generate an answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Iterative Refinement": "Implement an iterative version of CUQ where we: 1) Generate a compressed query, 2) Estimate uncertainty, 3) Expand the compressed query slightly, 4) Re-estimate uncertainty, 5) Repeat steps 3-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until uncertainty stabilizes.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Calibration error, 2) Brier score, 3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 4) Task-specific performance measures (e.g., accuracy for TriviaQA and BoolQ, solve rate for MATH).",
            "Step 7: Experiments": "Run experiments comparing CUQ and iterative CUQ against the baselines on all datasets. For each method and dataset, we will: 1) Generate answers and uncertainty estimates for all queries, 2) Calculate all evaluation metrics, 3) Perform statistical significance tests to compare methods.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis including: 1) Comparison of compressed vs. original queries, 2) Analysis of uncertainty estimates across different question types and difficulties, 3) Investigation of the impact of iterative refinement on uncertainty estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, is a famous landmark. It was constructed between 1887 and 1889 and stands at a height of 324 meters. The tower was named after engineer Gustave Eiffel. What is the height of the Eiffel Tower in feet?",
                "Baseline Output": "The Eiffel Tower is approximately 1,063 feet tall. (Confidence: 95%)",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a correct answer but with overconfident uncertainty estimation, as it doesn't account for potential errors in unit conversion."
            },
            "Example 2 (CUQ Success)": {
                "Step 1 Input": "Compress the following query to its most relevant information: The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, is a famous landmark. It was constructed between 1887 and 1889 and stands at a height of 324 meters. The tower was named after engineer Gustave Eiffel. What is the height of the Eiffel Tower in feet?",
                "Step 1 Output": "The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall. Convert this height to feet.",
                "Step 2 Input": "Based on the compressed query 'The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall. Convert this height to feet.', provide an answer and your uncertainty estimate.",
                "Step 2 Output": "The Eiffel Tower is approximately 1,063 feet tall. (Confidence: 85%)",
                "Explanation": "CUQ provides a more calibrated uncertainty estimate by focusing on the relevant information and acknowledging the potential for error in unit conversion."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CUQ method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality of the compressed queries - are they truly capturing the most relevant information? 2) The impact of compression on different types of questions or tasks. 3) How the model's uncertainty estimates change during the iterative refinement process. This could lead to insights about how LLMs process information and estimate uncertainty, potentially informing new approaches. Additionally, we could explore combining CUQ with other uncertainty estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or calibration approaches, to see if there are synergistic effects. Finally, we could expand our analysis to include more diverse tasks or longer, more complex queries to better understand the limitations and potential of our approach."
