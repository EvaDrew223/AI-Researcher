        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on a single model's perspective, which can lead to overconfident or inconsistent uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches include using softmax probabilities, temperature scaling, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting.",

        "Title": "Ensemble Disagreement Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on a single model's perspective, which can lead to overconfident or inconsistent uncertainty estimates. This problem is particularly critical in high-stakes applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like softmax probabilities, temperature scaling, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting have limitations in capturing the full spectrum of uncertainty. In human decision-making, seeking multiple opinions often leads to better-calibrated confidence. Similarly, leveraging the 'wisdom of the crowd' within a single LLM might improve uncertainty estimation. Our proposed method, Ensemble Disagreement Prompting, aims to simulate an ensemble of experts within a single LLM, potentially leading to more robust and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "Ensemble Disagreement Prompting consists of four main steps: 1) Expert Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate multiple 'expert personas' with diverse backgrounds. 2) Multi-Perspective Analysis: For each query, prompt the LLM to respond from the perspective of each expert persona. 3) Disagreement Quantification: Prompt the model to analyze the level of agreement/disagreement among the expert responses. 4) Uncertainty Synthesis: Based on the disagreement analysis, prompt the LLM to synthesize an overall uncertainty estimate, explaining the reasoning behind it.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for open-ended question answering, and 2) FEVER for fact verification. These datasets cover a range of topics and allow for evaluation of uncertainty estimation in different contexts.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each query. b) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature values (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during generation and compare softmax probabilities. c) Ensemble of separately prompted runs: Generate 5 separate responses and compute their variance as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: Ensemble Disagreement Prompting Implementation": "a) Expert Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 5 expert personas with diverse backgrounds relevant to the task. Example prompt: 'Generate 5 expert personas with diverse backgrounds in [relevant field]. For each persona, provide a brief description of their expertise and background.' b) Multi-Perspective Analysis: For each query, prompt the LLM to respond from the perspective of each expert persona. Example prompt: 'As [Expert 1], how would you answer the following question: [Query]?' Repeat for all experts. c) Disagreement Quantification: Prompt the LLM to analyze the level of agreement/disagreement among the expert responses. Example prompt: 'Analyze the level of agreement or disagreement among the following expert responses: [Expert Responses]. Provide a disagreement score on a scale of 0-100, where 0 means complete agreement and 100 means complete disagreement.' d) Uncertainty Synthesis: Prompt the LLM to synthesize an overall uncertainty estimate. Example prompt: 'Based on the expert responses and disagreement analysis, provide an overall uncertainty estimate for the answer to the query: [Query]. Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments, as it represents a state-of-the-art LLM with strong reasoning capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence estimates with its actual accuracy. b) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. c) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC): Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect predictions based on uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run both baseline methods and Ensemble Disagreement Prompting on the prepared datasets. For each method, generate uncertainty estimates for all queries in the datasets.",
            "Step 7: Results Analysis": "Compare the performance of Ensemble Disagreement Prompting against the baseline methods using the defined evaluation metrics. Analyze the quality of uncertainty explanations provided by the proposed method."

Zero Disagreement Score: The disagreement analysis yielded a score of 0 out of 100, indicating complete agreement among the experts.\n\nGiven these factors, we can state with very high confidence (approaching 100% certainty) that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. The uncertainty in this answer is negligible.",
            "explanation": "This example demonstrates how Ensemble Disagreement Prompting leverages multiple expert perspectives to provide a more robust uncertainty estimate. While the baseline method might give a simple confidence score, our method provides a detailed analysis of agreement among diverse experts and a well-reasoned uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Ensemble Disagreement Prompting method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated expert personas to understand if they truly represent diverse perspectives. If not, we could explore methods to increase diversity in persona generation. 2) Investigate the disagreement quantification step to see if the LLM is accurately capturing nuances in expert opinions. We could experiment with different prompting strategies for this step. 3) Examine cases where our method performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses. This could lead to insights about when ensemble methods are most effective for uncertainty estimation. 4) Explore combining our method with existing techniques like temperature scaling or calibration methods to create a hybrid approach. 5) Shift focus to analyzing how different types of questions or domains affect the performance of our method versus baselines, potentially uncovering interesting patterns in LLM uncertainty estimation across various contexts."
