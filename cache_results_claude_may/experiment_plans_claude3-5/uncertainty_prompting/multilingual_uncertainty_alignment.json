    "idea_name": "Multilingual Uncertainty Alignment",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit inconsistent uncertainty quantification across different languages, potentially due to varying levels of training data or cultural nuances in expressing uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification typically focus on a single language, usually English, and may not account for cross-lingual variations in confidence expression.",
        "Motivation": "By aligning uncertainty estimates across multiple languages, we can potentially uncover a more robust and culturally-agnostic measure of the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multilingual Uncertainty Alignment (MUA), a prompting technique that leverages cross-lingual information to calibrate uncertainty estimates. The process involves: 1) Formulating a question in multiple languages. 2) Prompting the model to answer each version of the question and provide a confidence estimate, using language-specific idioms for expressing uncertainty. 3) Asking the model to compare its answers and confidence levels across languages, and reconcile any differences. For example: 'You answered this question in English, French, and Japanese. Compare your answers and confidence levels. If there are differences, explain why and provide a reconciled confidence estimate.' 4) Using this cross-lingual dialogue to derive a unified uncertainty estimate that takes into account linguistic and cultural variations in expressing confidence. 5) Iteratively refining this process by introducing prompts that specifically address cultural differences in uncertainty expression, such as: 'In some cultures, expressing high confidence is seen as boastful. How might this affect your confidence estimate in each language?'",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MUA against standard monolingual uncertainty quantification methods on a diverse set of tasks across multiple languages. We'll use traditional metrics like calibration error and AUROC, but also develop new metrics to assess cross-lingual consistency in uncertainty estimates. We'll also conduct experiments to understand how the number and choice of languages affect the quality of the aligned uncertainty estimates, and compare our results with human judgments of confidence across different cultural contexts."

        "Title": "Multilingual Uncertainty Alignment: Calibrating Confidence Across Languages in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit inconsistent uncertainty quantification across different languages, potentially due to varying levels of training data or cultural nuances in expressing uncertainty. This inconsistency can lead to unreliable confidence estimates when models are used in multilingual settings, potentially causing issues in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification typically focus on a single language, usually English, and may not account for cross-lingual variations in confidence expression. By aligning uncertainty estimates across multiple languages, we can potentially uncover a more robust and culturally-agnostic measure of the model's true uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's multilingual capabilities to cross-validate its own uncertainty estimates, potentially leading to more reliable and consistent confidence calibration across languages.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multilingual Uncertainty Alignment (MUA), a prompting technique that leverages cross-lingual information to calibrate uncertainty estimates. The process involves five main steps: 1) Formulating a question in multiple languages. 2) Prompting the model to answer each version of the question and provide a confidence estimate, using language-specific idioms for expressing uncertainty. 3) Asking the model to compare its answers and confidence levels across languages, and reconcile any differences. 4) Using this cross-lingual dialogue to derive a unified uncertainty estimate that takes into account linguistic and cultural variations in expressing confidence. 5) Iteratively refining this process by introducing prompts that specifically address cultural differences in uncertainty expression.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select a diverse set of questions from existing multilingual datasets such as XNLI, MLQA, or XQuAD. Ensure the questions cover various domains and difficulty levels. Translate each question into at least three languages: English, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic, to cover diverse linguistic families.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Selection": "Choose GPT-4 as the primary model for experiments due to its strong multilingual capabilities. Also include GPT-3.5 and Claude 2 for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods for each model: a) Direct prompting with confidence estimation. b) Monte Carlo Dropout (if applicable to the chosen models). c) Ensemble methods (using different seeds or model versions).",
            "Step 4: Implement MUA": "Develop prompts for each step of the MUA process: a) Multilingual question formulation. b) Language-specific confidence estimation. c) Cross-lingual comparison and reconciliation. d) Unified uncertainty derivation. e) Cultural calibration prompts.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error and Maximum Calibration Error). b) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). c) Brier score. d) A new metric for cross-lingual consistency in uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Conduct Experiments": "Run experiments comparing MUA against baseline methods across all selected languages and questions. Vary the number and choice of languages used in MUA to assess its impact on performance.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation to compare MUA results with human judgments of confidence across different cultural contexts. Use a diverse panel of multilingual evaluators.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze results focusing on: a) Performance improvements over baselines. b) Cross-lingual consistency in uncertainty estimates. c) Impact of number and choice of languages on MUA performance. d) Correlation with human judgments. e) Effectiveness of cultural calibration prompts.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of MUA to the overall performance improvement.",
            "Step 10: Write-up and Documentation": "Document the entire process, including prompts used, experimental setup, results, and analysis. Prepare visualizations to illustrate the performance and cross-lingual consistency improvements."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Multilingual Formulation)": "Please answer the following question in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic: What is the capital of France? For each language, provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Multilingual Formulation)": "English: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 95\nMandarin Chinese: \u6cd5\u56fd\u7684\u9996\u90fd\u662f\u5df4\u9ece\u3002\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1a90\nArabic: \u0639\u0627\u0635\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0633. \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0642\u0629: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Cross-lingual Comparison)": "You answered the question 'What is the capital of France?' in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic. Compare your answers and confidence levels. If there are differences, explain why and provide a reconciled confidence estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Cross-lingual Comparison)": "The answers in all three languages correctly identify Paris as the capital of France. However, there are differences in the confidence levels:\n\nEnglish: 95\nMandarin Chinese: 90\nArabic: 85\n\nThese differences might be due to varying levels of exposure to French culture and history in different linguistic contexts. The lower confidence in Arabic could reflect a cultural tendency to express less certainty. The highest confidence in English might be due to the model's stronger training in English-language data.\n\nConsidering these factors, a reconciled confidence estimate would be 90. This takes into account the consistency of the answer across languages while acknowledging the variation in expressed confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Cultural Calibration)": "In some cultures, expressing high confidence is seen as boastful, while in others it's expected. How might this affect your confidence estimates in each language? Provide a culturally calibrated confidence estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Cultural Calibration)": "Cultural differences in expressing confidence could indeed affect the estimates:\n\n1. English-speaking cultures often value directness and confidence in communication. The high confidence of 95 aligns with this.\n\n2. In many Chinese-speaking cultures, modesty is valued, which might explain the slightly lower confidence of 90. However, stating facts confidently is also respected.\n\n3. Arabic-speaking cultures often use more nuanced expressions of certainty, sometimes preferring to add phrases like 'God willing' even when very sure. This could explain the lower confidence of 85.\n\nConsidering these cultural factors, a culturally calibrated confidence estimate would be 92. This estimate acknowledges the high certainty of the fact across cultures while respecting cultural differences in expressing confidence. It's slightly higher than the previous reconciled estimate because we recognize that the lower Arabic estimate likely reflects cultural expression rather than actual uncertainty about the fact.",
            "Explanation": "The MUA method demonstrates how cross-lingual comparison and cultural calibration can lead to a more nuanced and potentially more accurate confidence estimate. By considering multiple languages and cultural contexts, we can identify and account for biases or inconsistencies in the model's confidence estimation across languages."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUA method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification or cross-lingual consistency, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how uncertainty is expressed across languages, focusing on linguistic and cultural factors that influence confidence estimation. This could involve a systematic comparison of confidence expressions and their interpretations across languages. 2) Investigate whether the inconsistencies in uncertainty estimation are due to biases in the training data or inherent model limitations. This could lead to recommendations for improving multilingual model training. 3) Develop a new metric for evaluating cross-lingual consistency in uncertainty estimation, which could be valuable for future research in this area. 4) Explore how different prompting strategies affect uncertainty estimation across languages, potentially uncovering more effective ways to elicit consistent confidence estimates. 5) Investigate the relationship between a model's performance in a language and its ability to accurately estimate uncertainty in that language, which could provide insights into the connection between language proficiency and metacognition in AI models."
