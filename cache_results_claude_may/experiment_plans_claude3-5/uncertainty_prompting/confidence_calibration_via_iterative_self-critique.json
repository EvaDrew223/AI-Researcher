    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, leading to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include using model logits, ensemble disagreement, or linguistic markers of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often improve their confidence calibration through self-reflection and critique. By mimicking this process, we can potentially achieve better-calibrated LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique called Iterative Self-Critique (ISC). The process involves four steps: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Self-critique prompting, where the model analyzes potential weaknesses in its answer, 3) Confidence recalibration, where the model adjusts its confidence based on the critique, and 4) Response refinement. This process is repeated for multiple iterations, with each iteration potentially improving the calibration. The final output includes both the refined response and a calibrated confidence score.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare ISC against standard prompting, single-pass self-critique, and existing calibration methods on various question-answering datasets. Evaluate using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score."

        "Title": "Iterative Self-Critique: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, leading to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation. This overconfidence can result in users placing undue trust in incorrect or speculative information, which is particularly problematic in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, or legal advice.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for calibrating LLM confidence, such as using model logits, ensemble disagreement, or linguistic markers of uncertainty, often require access to model internals or multiple model runs, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for many applications. Inspired by human cognitive processes, where self-reflection and critique often lead to improved confidence calibration, we propose a novel prompting technique that leverages the LLM's own capabilities to assess and refine its confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Self-Critique (ISC), a prompting technique that involves four main steps: 1) Initial response generation, where the model produces an answer and an initial confidence estimate. 2) Self-critique prompting, where the model analyzes potential weaknesses in its answer. 3) Confidence recalibration, where the model adjusts its confidence based on the critique. 4) Response refinement, where the model potentially improves its answer. This process is repeated for multiple iterations, with each iteration potentially improving the calibration. The final output includes both the refined response and a calibrated confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual accuracy and calibration, 2) MMLU for testing performance on multi-task, multi-domain questions, and 3) HumanEval for evaluating code generation tasks. These datasets cover a range of task types and domains, allowing us to assess the generalizability of our method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly asking the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. 2) Single-pass self-critique: allowing the model one round of self-critique before giving the final answer and confidence. 3) Temperature scaling: using different temperature settings to implicitly calibrate confidence.",
            "Step 3: ISC Implementation": "Implement the Iterative Self-Critique method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response generation: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide an initial confidence score. b) Self-critique: Prompt the model to identify potential weaknesses or uncertainties in its answer. c) Confidence recalibration: Based on the self-critique, prompt the model to adjust its confidence score. d) Response refinement: Allow the model to refine its answer if necessary. e) Iteration: Repeat steps b-d for a set number of iterations (we will experiment with 1, 3, and 5 iterations).",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are widely used and represent different capabilities, allowing us to assess how our method performs across model sizes.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure the overall calibration. 2) Brier score to assess both calibration and accuracy. 3) Task-specific metrics: accuracy for TruthfulQA and MMLU, pass@k for HumanEval. 4) Qualitative analysis of self-critiques and refinements to understand the method's behavior.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: 1) Vary the number of iterations (1, 3, 5) to find the optimal balance between performance and computational cost. 2) Compare performance with and without the response refinement step to isolate the impact of calibration vs. answer improvement. 3) Experiment with different prompting strategies for the self-critique step (e.g., more structured critique prompts vs. open-ended prompts).",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze the results to answer key questions: 1) Does ISC improve calibration compared to baselines? 2) How does the number of iterations affect performance? 3) Are there differences in effectiveness across different task types or domains? 4) How does model size impact the effectiveness of ISC? Prepare visualizations of calibration curves and performance across different settings."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ISC Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ISC Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ISC Step 2: Self-Critique)": "You answered that the capital of France is Paris with 100% confidence. Please critique your answer and confidence level. Are there any potential weaknesses or uncertainties in your response?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ISC Step 2: Self-Critique)": "While I'm highly confident that Paris is the capital of France, there are a few considerations that might warrant a slight reduction in confidence:\n1. Historical changes: Capitals can change over time, though this is rare for well-established countries.\n2. Multiple capitals: Some countries have multiple capitals for different functions, though this is not typically the case for France.\n3. Definition of 'capital': There could be nuances in what's considered the capital (e.g., administrative vs. cultural capital).\n4. Personal knowledge limitations: As an AI, my knowledge cutoff date might mean I'm not aware of very recent changes.\nGiven these factors, a slightly lower confidence might be more appropriate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ISC Step 3: Confidence Recalibration)": "Based on your self-critique, please provide a recalibrated confidence score for your answer that Paris is the capital of France, on a scale of 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ISC Step 3: Confidence Recalibration)": "Recalibrated confidence: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ISC Step 4: Response Refinement)": "Given your self-critique and recalibrated confidence, would you like to refine your original answer? If so, please provide the refined answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ISC Step 4: Response Refinement)": "Refined answer: The capital of France is Paris. While this is a well-established fact, it's worth noting that the concept of a capital can have nuances, such as distinctions between administrative, legislative, or cultural centers. However, Paris serves as the primary capital in all major aspects. Confidence: 98",
            "Explanation": "The ISC method allows the model to critically examine its initial high-confidence response. Through self-critique, the model identifies potential sources of uncertainty, leading to a slight reduction in confidence and a more nuanced final answer. This process demonstrates improved calibration compared to the baseline, where the model gave 100% confidence without consideration of potential uncertainties."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ISC method does not significantly improve confidence calibration over baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine the quality and relevance of the self-critiques generated by the model, investigating whether the model is capable of meaningful self-analysis. We might find that the model struggles to identify genuine sources of uncertainty, or that it's overly conservative in all cases, leading to poor discrimination between high and low confidence situations. In this case, we could explore alternative prompting strategies for the self-critique step, such as providing more structured guidance or examples of good critiques. Additionally, we could investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, potentially leading to insights about when and how to apply self-critique techniques. If the iterative aspect doesn't show improvements, we could focus on a single round of more intensive self-analysis, potentially incorporating external knowledge sources to guide the critique process. Ultimately, even if the method doesn't improve calibration as hoped, the analysis of how LLMs attempt to critique themselves and adjust confidence could provide valuable insights into their reasoning processes and limitations."
