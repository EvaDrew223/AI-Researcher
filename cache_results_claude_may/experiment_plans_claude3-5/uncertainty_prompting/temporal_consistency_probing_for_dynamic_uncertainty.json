        "Problem": "LLMs often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when queried multiple times or when the context changes slightly, indicating a lack of robust uncertainty quantification.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess confidence based on single interactions, neglecting the potential for temporal inconsistencies in model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence tends to be relatively stable over short time periods unless new information is introduced. Mimicking this temporal consistency could lead to more reliable uncertainty estimates in LLMs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing (TCP), a dynamic prompting strategy that assesses model uncertainty over multiple interactions. TCP operates in three phases: 1) Initial Probing: The model is queried multiple times with slight variations of the same question, collecting initial confidence estimates. 2) Perturbation Introduction: Small, irrelevant details are added to the context, and the model is re-queried. 3) Consistency Analysis: The variation in confidence estimates across time and perturbations is analyzed. Models are prompted to explain discrepancies in their confidence, leading to a meta-level uncertainty assessment. The final uncertainty metric is derived from both the raw confidence scores and the model's ability to maintain consistent estimates over time and minor perturbations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TCP against static confidence estimation methods on a range of tasks, including question-answering and reasoning problems. Measure performance using traditional calibration metrics, as well as novel metrics designed to capture temporal consistency and robustness to irrelevant perturbations."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Probing: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when queried multiple times or when the context changes slightly, indicating a lack of robust uncertainty quantification. This inconsistency undermines the reliability of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically assess confidence based on single interactions, neglecting the potential for temporal inconsistencies in model uncertainty. Human confidence, in contrast, tends to be relatively stable over short time periods unless new information is introduced. Mimicking this temporal consistency could lead to more reliable uncertainty estimates in LLMs. By introducing a dynamic prompting strategy that assesses model uncertainty over multiple interactions, we aim to capture a more robust and human-like measure of confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Probing (TCP), a dynamic prompting strategy that assesses model uncertainty over multiple interactions. TCP operates in three phases: 1) Initial Probing: The model is queried multiple times with slight variations of the same question, collecting initial confidence estimates. 2) Perturbation Introduction: Small, irrelevant details are added to the context, and the model is re-queried. 3) Consistency Analysis: The variation in confidence estimates across time and perturbations is analyzed.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks including question-answering (SQuAD), reasoning (RACE), and knowledge-based tasks (TriviaQA). For each dataset, prepare a subset of 100 questions for detailed analysis.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API, and Claude from Anthropic's API.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation methods: a) Direct confidence querying (e.g., 'How confident are you in your answer?') b) Probability distribution over answer choices (for multiple-choice questions) c) Entropy of token probabilities for open-ended questions",
            "Step 4: TCP Implementation": "a) Initial Probing: For each question, create 5 slight variations (e.g., rephrasing, changing word order). Query the model with each variation and record the confidence estimates. b) Perturbation Introduction: Add 3 irrelevant details to the context (e.g., 'It's a sunny day.', 'The current year is 2023.', 'Blue is a color.'). Re-query the model with these perturbed contexts. c) Consistency Analysis: Calculate the variance in confidence estimates across all queries. Prompt the model to explain any discrepancies in its confidence levels.",
            "Step 5: Metric Development": "Develop a composite TCP score that combines: a) Mean confidence across all queries b) Variance in confidence estimates c) Model's self-assessment of confidence discrepancies",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "a) Compare TCP scores against baseline confidence estimates b) Assess correlation between TCP scores and actual model performance c) Analyze how TCP scores change with increasing model size and across different task types",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (e.g., 20 expert raters) to judge whether TCP scores align better with human intuition about model uncertainty compared to baseline methods.",
            "Step 8: Analysis and Visualization": "a) Create visualizations showing how confidence estimates change across different queries and perturbations b) Analyze patterns in the model's explanations for confidence discrepancies c) Investigate how different types of perturbations affect confidence estimates"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in my answer."
            },
            "TCP Example": {
                "Initial Probing": {
                    "Input 1": "Q: What city serves as the capital of France?",
                    "Output 1": "A: The city that serves as the capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
                    "Input 2": "Q: Which city is considered the capital of France?",
                    "Output 2": "A: Paris is considered the capital of France. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
                    "Input 3": "Q: Can you tell me the capital city of France?",
                    "Output 3": "A: The capital city of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in this answer."
                },
                "Perturbation Introduction": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Note: It's a sunny day today.",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in this answer. The fact that it's a sunny day doesn't affect the answer to this question."
                },
                "Consistency Analysis": {
                    "Input": "You've been asked about the capital of France multiple times with slight variations and irrelevant information added. Your confidence has remained at 100% throughout. Can you explain why your confidence hasn't changed?",
                    "Output": "My confidence hasn't changed because the capital of France is a well-established fact that doesn't depend on context or phrasing. Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, and this information is fundamental and unchanging. The slight variations in how the question was asked or the addition of irrelevant information (like the weather) don't affect this fact. My high confidence comes from the consistency and reliability of this information across various reputable sources and historical records."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "In this example, the baseline method simply asks for confidence directly, which often results in overconfident answers. The TCP method, however, probes the model's confidence through multiple variations and perturbations. Despite the model maintaining 100% confidence, the TCP approach provides a more nuanced view of the model's certainty by asking it to reflect on its consistent high confidence. This meta-level analysis can reveal insights into the model's reasoning process and the basis for its confidence, which can be valuable for assessing the reliability of its uncertainty estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the TCP method doesn't show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a more in-depth analysis of the patterns in confidence fluctuations across different types of questions and perturbations. This could provide insights into what kinds of information or context changes are most likely to affect model confidence. Second, we could explore combining TCP with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or dropout-based approaches, to see if a hybrid method yields better results. Third, we could shift focus to analyzing the model's explanations for its confidence levels, potentially uncovering interesting patterns in how LLMs justify their certainty or uncertainty. This could lead to a paper on the 'Anatomy of LLM Confidence' rather than a new method for uncertainty quantification. Lastly, we could investigate how TCP performs across different model sizes and architectures, which could provide valuable insights into how uncertainty estimation capabilities evolve as models become more advanced."
