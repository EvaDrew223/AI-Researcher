        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to account for the temporal nature of their knowledge cutoff, leading to overconfidence in potentially outdated information or uncertainty about recent events.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically ignore the temporal aspect of knowledge or rely on simple timestamp comparisons, which don't capture the nuanced ways information can change over time.",
        "Motivation": "Different types of information have different 'decay rates' in terms of relevance and accuracy over time. By modeling these temporal dynamics, we can better estimate uncertainty for queries that are time-sensitive.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Drift Uncertainty Quantification (TDUQ), which involves: 1) Prompting the LLM to estimate the time-sensitivity of the query on a scale from 'static' (e.g., mathematical facts) to 'highly dynamic' (e.g., current events). 2) For time-sensitive queries, asking the model to estimate the 'half-life' of relevant information - how quickly it becomes outdated. 3) Prompting the model to provide its best answer along with the approximate date this information was last verified. 4) Calculating a 'temporal drift factor' based on the estimated half-life and the time elapsed since the information was last verified. 5) Adjusting the model's confidence based on this temporal drift factor, with greater drift leading to lower confidence. 6) For highly dynamic topics, prompting the model to speculate on possible recent changes and factor this speculation into its uncertainty estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TDUQ on a curated dataset of time-sensitive queries spanning different domains and temporal scales. Compare against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods. Assess both immediate performance and how well the uncertainty estimates hold up when evaluated against future information."

        "Title": "Temporal Drift Uncertainty Quantification: Calibrating LLM Confidence Based on Information Decay",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for the temporal nature of their knowledge cutoff, leading to overconfidence in potentially outdated information or uncertainty about recent events. This can result in inaccurate or misleading responses, especially for time-sensitive queries.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically ignore the temporal aspect of knowledge or rely on simple timestamp comparisons, which don't capture the nuanced ways information can change over time. Different types of information have different 'decay rates' in terms of relevance and accuracy over time. By modeling these temporal dynamics, we can better estimate uncertainty for queries that are time-sensitive, leading to more reliable and trustworthy LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Drift Uncertainty Quantification (TDUQ), which involves: 1) Prompting the LLM to estimate the time-sensitivity of the query on a scale from 'static' to 'highly dynamic'. 2) For time-sensitive queries, asking the model to estimate the 'half-life' of relevant information. 3) Prompting the model to provide its best answer along with the approximate date this information was last verified. 4) Calculating a 'temporal drift factor' based on the estimated half-life and the time elapsed since the information was last verified. 5) Adjusting the model's confidence based on this temporal drift factor, with greater drift leading to lower confidence. 6) For highly dynamic topics, prompting the model to speculate on possible recent changes and factor this speculation into its uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a curated dataset of time-sensitive queries spanning different domains and temporal scales. Include a mix of static facts, slowly changing information, and rapidly evolving topics. For each query, include the ground truth answer and the date of the most recent verified information. Sources can include news articles, historical events, scientific discoveries, and current affairs.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods as baselines. These should include: a) Direct prompting without uncertainty estimation, b) Simple confidence scoring (e.g., asking the model to rate its confidence on a scale of 1-10), c) Existing methods like Monte Carlo Dropout or ensemble methods if applicable to the chosen LLM API.",
            "Step 3: TDUQ Implementation": "Implement the TDUQ method with the following sub-steps for each query: a) Prompt for time-sensitivity estimation, b) Prompt for information half-life estimation, c) Prompt for best answer and last verification date, d) Calculate temporal drift factor, e) Adjust confidence based on drift factor, f) Prompt for speculation on recent changes if highly dynamic.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API as the primary models for evaluation. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic and PaLM from Google for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each query in the dataset: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their outputs and confidence scores. b) Apply the TDUQ method and record all intermediate outputs (time-sensitivity, half-life, etc.) as well as the final adjusted confidence score. c) Store all results, including full model outputs, for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of TDUQ against baselines using the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Compare model outputs to ground truth answers. b) Calibration: Assess how well the confidence scores align with actual accuracy. c) Temporal Robustness: Evaluate how well the confidence scores hold up when assessed against future information (simulated by using more recent ground truth data). d) Qualitative Analysis: Manually review a subset of outputs to assess the quality and relevance of the temporal reasoning.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Iteration": "Analyze the results to identify strengths and weaknesses of TDUQ. Look for patterns in performance across different types of queries and time scales. Use these insights to refine the method, potentially adjusting the prompts or the confidence calculation formula."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Who is the current President of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The current President of France is Emmanuel Macron. He was elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2022 for a second term.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Time-sensitivity)": "On a scale from 1 (static) to 10 (highly dynamic), how time-sensitive is the following question: 'Who is the current President of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Time-sensitivity)": "7 - This information is moderately time-sensitive. While presidential terms typically last several years, changes can occur due to elections, resignations, or other political events.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Half-life)": "Estimate the 'half-life' of the information related to the current President of France. In other words, after how long would you expect this information to have a 50% chance of being outdated?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Half-life)": "The half-life of this information is approximately 2.5 years. Presidential terms in France last 5 years, so at the midpoint of a term, there's roughly a 50% chance that the information could change due to the next election or unforeseen circumstances.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Answer and Verification Date)": "Who is the current President of France? Please provide your best answer along with the approximate date when this information was last verified in your training data.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Answer and Verification Date)": "The current President of France is Emmanuel Macron. This information was last verified in my training data around September 2022, shortly after his re-election for a second term.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Speculation)": "Given that the information about the French presidency might have changed since your last update, what are some possible recent changes or events that could have affected this information?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Speculation)": "Possible recent changes or events that could have affected this information include:\n1. An unexpected resignation of President Macron.\n2. A vote of no confidence leading to early elections.\n3. A major political scandal forcing a change in leadership.\n4. Constitutional changes affecting the presidency.\n5. Health issues or other personal reasons causing Macron to step down.\nHowever, it's important to note that these are speculative possibilities, and without access to current information, I cannot confirm if any of these have actually occurred.",
            "Explanation": "The TDUQ method provides a more nuanced understanding of the temporal nature of the information. It acknowledges the time-sensitivity of the query, estimates how quickly the information might become outdated, provides the last known verified date, and speculates on possible changes. This allows for a more accurate adjustment of confidence based on the time elapsed since the last verification, potentially avoiding overconfidence in outdated information."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TDUQ method doesn't significantly improve over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why TDUQ fails, which could provide valuable insights into the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. 2) Explore alternative formulations of the temporal drift factor, possibly incorporating more complex decay models or domain-specific knowledge. 3) Investigate the effectiveness of TDUQ across different types of queries and time scales, which could lead to a taxonomy of temporal sensitivity in LLM knowledge. 4) Combine TDUQ with other uncertainty quantification methods to create a hybrid approach that addresses both temporal and non-temporal sources of uncertainty. 5) Develop a meta-analysis framework that uses the TDUQ outputs to study how LLM knowledge evolves over time and across different domains."
