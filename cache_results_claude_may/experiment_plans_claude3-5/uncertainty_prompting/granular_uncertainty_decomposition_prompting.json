    "idea_name": "Granular Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often provide a single, coarse-grained confidence score, failing to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically output an overall confidence score without breaking down the contributing factors to uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing uncertainty into specific components, we can provide more actionable insights into the model's decision-making process and identify particular areas where the model lacks confidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Granular Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (GUDP), a technique that guides the model to break down its uncertainty into specific components. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Provide an initial answer, 2) Identify key factors contributing to the answer (e.g., relevant facts, logical steps, assumptions), 3) Assign confidence scores to each factor individually, explaining the reasoning, 4) Analyze how uncertainty in each factor propagates to the final answer, 5) Synthesize an overall confidence score based on the granular analysis. This method allows for a detailed uncertainty profile rather than a single score.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare GUDP with holistic confidence estimation methods on tasks with multiple potential sources of uncertainty, such as multi-hop reasoning questions and interdisciplinary analysis. Evaluate using decomposed calibration metrics for each uncertainty component and assess the method's ability to pinpoint specific areas of low confidence that could benefit from further information or reasoning."

        "Title": "Granular Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single, coarse-grained confidence score, failing to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex tasks. This limitation hinders our ability to understand and improve model decision-making processes, particularly in high-stakes applications where precise uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically output an overall confidence score without breaking down the contributing factors to uncertainty. By decomposing uncertainty into specific components, we can provide more actionable insights into the model's decision-making process and identify particular areas where the model lacks confidence. This granular approach to uncertainty quantification can lead to more interpretable and reliable AI systems, enabling targeted improvements and better-informed decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Granular Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting (GUDP), a technique that guides the model to break down its uncertainty into specific components. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Provide an initial answer, 2) Identify key factors contributing to the answer (e.g., relevant facts, logical steps, assumptions), 3) Assign confidence scores to each factor individually, explaining the reasoning, 4) Analyze how uncertainty in each factor propagates to the final answer, 5) Synthesize an overall confidence score based on the granular analysis. This method allows for a detailed uncertainty profile rather than a single score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use three datasets that cover different types of reasoning tasks: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving, and 3) MMLU for multi-task language understanding.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with a request for confidence score, 2) Temperature scaling method where we use different temperature settings to generate multiple outputs and calculate the variance as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: GUDP Implementation": "Develop the GUDP prompt template. For each task type, create a few-shot example demonstrating the desired GUDP output format. The prompt should guide the model through the five steps outlined in the proposed method.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Data Processing": "For each dataset, randomly select 100 examples for evaluation. Ensure a balanced distribution of easy and difficult questions to test the method's effectiveness across various difficulty levels.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each example in the evaluation set: 1) Apply the baseline methods, 2) Apply the GUDP method, 3) Store the outputs, including intermediate steps for GUDP.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Overall accuracy of the final answers, 2) Calibration error (comparing predicted confidence with actual accuracy), 3) Decomposed calibration error (for each identified factor in GUDP), 4) Spearman's rank correlation between granular confidence scores and factor-specific accuracies.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of GUDP against baselines in terms of accuracy and calibration. 2) Analyze the granular uncertainty components identified by GUDP and their correlation with actual errors. 3) Investigate how uncertainty propagates from individual factors to the final answer in GUDP. 4) Examine cases where GUDP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "1) Vary the number of factors requested in GUDP to analyze its impact on performance. 2) Test a simplified version of GUDP without the propagation analysis step to assess its importance. 3) Experiment with different prompting strategies for factor identification (e.g., open-ended vs. guided).",
            "Step 10: Generalization Test": "Apply the best-performing GUDP variant to a held-out dataset (e.g., ARC-Challenge) to assess its generalization capabilities to unseen task types."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (GUDP)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please follow these steps:\n1) Provide an initial answer.\n2) Identify key factors contributing to your answer (e.g., relevant facts, logical steps, assumptions).\n3) Assign confidence scores (0-1) to each factor, explaining your reasoning.\n4) Analyze how uncertainty in each factor affects the final answer.\n5) Synthesize an overall confidence score based on this analysis.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (GUDP)": "1) Initial answer: The capital of France is Paris.\n\n2) Key factors:\na) General knowledge of world capitals\nb) Personal experience or education about France\nc) Consistency of this information across various sources\n\n3) Confidence scores for each factor:\na) General knowledge: 0.99 - This is a widely known fact that is consistently taught and referenced.\nb) Personal experience/education: 0.95 - I have learned this information multiple times and it has been reinforced through various educational sources.\nc) Consistency across sources: 0.98 - This information is consistently reported across reputable sources with no significant contradictions.\n\n4) Uncertainty propagation:\n- The high confidence in general knowledge provides a strong foundation for the answer.\n- Personal experience/education reinforces this knowledge, slightly lowering overall certainty due to potential personal biases or misrememberings.\n- The high consistency across sources further solidifies the answer, mitigating most remaining doubt.\n\n5) Overall confidence score: 0.97\n\nThe overall confidence is very high due to the consistency and reinforcement across multiple factors. The slight reduction from 0.99 to 0.97 accounts for the small possibility of recent geopolitical changes or extremely rare errors in commonly accepted knowledge.",
            "Explanation": "GUDP provides a more detailed and nuanced assessment of the model's confidence, breaking down the reasoning process and allowing for better understanding of potential sources of uncertainty. This granular approach can help identify specific areas where the model might be less certain, even in cases where the overall confidence is high."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If GUDP does not significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration or does not provide meaningful decompositions of uncertainty, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the patterns in factor identification and confidence assignment across different task types, potentially uncovering insights into how LLMs reason about their own knowledge and uncertainties. This could lead to a paper on the introspective capabilities of LLMs. Second, we could investigate whether the granular confidence scores from GUDP can be used to improve performance on downstream tasks, such as information retrieval or multi-model fusion. Finally, we could explore whether GUDP can be used as a data generation technique for training smaller, more calibrated models, turning the project into a study on knowledge distillation for improved uncertainty quantification."
