    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to identify their own weaknesses and potential failure modes, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include self-consistency checks and generating multiple reasoning paths.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the LLM to actively search for flaws in its own reasoning, we can potentially uncover more realistic confidence estimates and improve overall calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Critique Prompting (ASCP), a multi-step process where: 1) The LLM generates an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) We prompt the LLM to act as a harsh critic, actively searching for flaws in the reasoning or potential alternative answers. 3) The LLM responds to these critiques, either defending its original answer or acknowledging errors. 4) Steps 2-3 are repeated for multiple rounds. 5) Finally, the LLM is asked to provide a revised answer and confidence estimate based on this adversarial self-critique process. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to 'think like an opponent' and challenge its own assumptions.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ASCP against standard prompting and self-consistency methods on reasoning tasks from benchmarks like BIG-bench and MMLU. Measure improvements in calibration, selective prediction, and the ability to identify edge cases or potential errors."

        "Title": "Adversarial Self-Critique Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own confidence and identify potential failure modes, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers. This issue is particularly problematic in high-stakes applications where understanding model uncertainty is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as self-consistency checks and multiple reasoning paths, do not fully leverage the model's ability to critically evaluate its own outputs. By prompting the LLM to actively search for flaws in its reasoning, we can potentially uncover more realistic confidence estimates and improve overall calibration. This approach is inspired by the human cognitive process of self-reflection and critical thinking, where we often challenge our own assumptions to arrive at more robust conclusions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Critique Prompting (ASCP), a multi-step process to improve uncertainty quantification in LLMs: 1) The LLM generates an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) We prompt the LLM to act as a harsh critic, actively searching for flaws in the reasoning or potential alternative answers. 3) The LLM responds to these critiques, either defending its original answer or acknowledging errors. 4) Steps 2-3 are repeated for multiple rounds. 5) Finally, the LLM is asked to provide a revised answer and confidence estimate based on this adversarial self-critique process. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to 'think like an opponent' and challenge its own assumptions.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use the following datasets to evaluate our method: 1) BIG-bench (focusing on reasoning tasks), 2) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), and 3) TruthfulQA. These datasets cover a wide range of reasoning tasks and factual knowledge, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of ASCP across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Methods": "We will implement the following baseline methods for comparison: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, 3) Self-consistency (generating multiple answers and taking the majority), 4) Calibrated self-evaluation (asking the model to evaluate its own confidence).",
            "Step 4: ASCP Implementation": "We will implement ASCP as follows: a) Initial answer generation: 'Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' b) Critique generation: 'You are now a harsh critic. What are potential flaws or alternative viewpoints for the following answer? Be specific and point out any weaknesses: [INITIAL_ANSWER]' c) Response to critique: 'Consider the following critique of your answer. Defend your original answer or acknowledge any valid points: [CRITIQUE]' d) Repeat steps b and c for 3 rounds. e) Final answer and confidence: 'Based on the discussion above, what is your final answer and revised confidence score (0-100) for the original question?'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate performance: 1) Accuracy: percentage of correct answers, 2) Calibration error: difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy, 3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): weighted average of calibration errors across confidence buckets, 4) Brier score: combines calibration and accuracy in a single metric, 5) Selective accuracy: accuracy when the model is allowed to abstain on uncertain answers.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run all baseline methods and ASCP on the entire dataset. b) Collect predictions, confidence scores, and intermediate outputs (for ASCP). c) Calculate all evaluation metrics. d) Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to compare ASCP with baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare ASCP performance against baselines across different datasets and models. b) Analyze the impact of the number of critique rounds on performance. c) Examine cases where ASCP significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines. d) Investigate the relationship between the nature of the critiques and the final confidence estimates. e) Assess the impact of ASCP on different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning tasks)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ASCP; Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ASCP; Step 1: Initial Answer)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ASCP; Step 2: Critique Generation)": "You are now a harsh critic. What are potential flaws or alternative viewpoints for the following answer? Be specific and point out any weaknesses: 'The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 100'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ASCP; Step 2: Critique Generation)": "Critique: While it's true that Paris is widely recognized as the capital of France, there are a few potential weaknesses in this answer: 1) The confidence score of 100 seems overly high, as there's always a small possibility of error or change. 2) The answer doesn't acknowledge that some countries have multiple capitals or that capitals can change over time. 3) It doesn't specify whether it's referring to the political, economic, or cultural capital, which could be different in some countries.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ASCP; Step 3: Response to Critique)": "Consider the following critique of your answer. Defend your original answer or acknowledge any valid points: [CRITIQUE FROM STEP 2]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ASCP; Step 3: Response to Critique)": "Response: I acknowledge the valid points raised in the critique. While Paris is indeed the capital of France, my initial confidence score of 100 was too high. It's true that capitals can change over time, and some countries have multiple capitals for different functions. In this case, Paris is the political, economic, and cultural capital of France, but I should have specified this. A more appropriate confidence score would be 95, reflecting the high certainty of the answer while acknowledging the small possibility of change or nuance.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ASCP; Final Step: Revised Answer)": "Based on the discussion above, what is your final answer and revised confidence score (0-100) for the original question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ASCP; Final Step: Revised Answer)": "Final Answer: The capital of France is Paris, serving as its political, economic, and cultural center. Revised confidence score: 95",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how ASCP can lead to more nuanced and better-calibrated responses. The initial high-confidence answer is challenged, leading to a more detailed final answer with a slightly lower but more realistic confidence score. This process helps in reducing overconfidence and encourages the model to consider potential uncertainties or alternative viewpoints."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ASCP does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could investigate: 1) The quality and diversity of self-generated critiques, potentially revealing limitations in the model's ability to critically evaluate its own outputs. 2) The model's responsiveness to critiques, which might indicate issues with incorporating new information or changing initial judgments. 3) The relationship between critique rounds and performance, to see if there's an optimal number of rounds or if the process converges. 4) Task-specific performance differences, which could suggest that ASCP is more effective for certain types of questions. Based on these analyses, we could propose modifications to ASCP, such as using external knowledge sources for critique generation, or combining ASCP with other uncertainty quantification methods. Alternatively, we could reframe the project as an in-depth analysis of LLM self-evaluation capabilities, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of current models in this area."
