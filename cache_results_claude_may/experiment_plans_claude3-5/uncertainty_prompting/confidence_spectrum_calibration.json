    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty across different types of tasks and knowledge domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on binary confidence estimation or single-value confidence scores.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express confidence as a range or spectrum rather than a single value, allowing for more nuanced uncertainty representation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Calibration (CSC), a novel prompting technique that elicits a continuous spectrum of confidence from LLMs. The prompt instructs the model to generate a confidence distribution across a predefined range (e.g., 0-100%) for each response. This distribution is represented as a series of points, each with an associated confidence level. For example: '10%: Not confident at all, 30%: Slightly confident, 50%: Moderately confident, 70%: Quite confident, 90%: Very confident'. The model then places its response at the most appropriate point on this spectrum. This method allows for more granular and informative uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CSC against standard binary and single-value confidence estimation methods on diverse tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge tests. Evaluate using calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score, as well as task-specific performance metrics."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Calibration: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately express uncertainty across different types of tasks and knowledge domains. Current approaches typically focus on binary confidence estimation or single-value confidence scores, which fail to capture the nuanced spectrum of uncertainty that human experts often express.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are limited in their ability to represent the full spectrum of confidence levels. Binary confidence estimation oversimplifies the problem, while single-value confidence scores lack granularity. Human experts, on the other hand, often express confidence as a range or spectrum, allowing for more nuanced uncertainty representation. By developing a method that mimics this human-like expression of confidence, we can potentially improve the calibration and interpretability of LLM outputs across various tasks and knowledge domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Calibration (CSC), a novel prompting technique that elicits a continuous spectrum of confidence from LLMs. The method works as follows:\n1. Design a prompt that instructs the model to generate a confidence distribution across a predefined range (e.g., 0-100%) for each response.\n2. Represent this distribution as a series of points, each with an associated confidence level. For example: '10%: Not confident at all, 30%: Slightly confident, 50%: Moderately confident, 70%: Quite confident, 90%: Very confident'.\n3. Prompt the model to place its response at the most appropriate point on this spectrum.\n4. Analyze the resulting confidence distribution to assess the model's uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering different task types:\n1. Factual QA: Use TriviaQA and Natural Questions datasets.\n2. Commonsense Reasoning: Use COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) and WinoGrande datasets.\n3. Domain-specific Knowledge: Use MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) dataset, focusing on subsets like medicine, law, and computer science.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods:\n1. Binary Confidence Estimation: Prompt the model to provide a binary confidence (yes/no) along with its answer.\n2. Single-value Confidence Score: Prompt the model to provide a single confidence score (0-100%) along with its answer.",
            "Step 3: CSC Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Spectrum Calibration method:\n1. Design the CSC prompt template: 'Answer the following question and provide your confidence using the following spectrum: 10%: Not confident at all, 30%: Slightly confident, 50%: Moderately confident, 70%: Quite confident, 90%: Very confident. Place your answer at the most appropriate confidence level and explain why.'\n2. Apply this prompt to each question in the datasets.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics:\n1. Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy.\n2. Brier Score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.\n3. Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): Evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds.\n4. Task-specific performance metrics: Use accuracy for factual QA and commonsense reasoning, and F1 score for domain-specific knowledge tasks.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "1. Run all three methods (binary, single-value, and CSC) on each dataset using both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n2. Collect model outputs, including answers and confidence estimations.\n3. Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method and model combination.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1. Compare the performance of CSC against baseline methods across all datasets and metrics.\n2. Analyze how CSC performs across different task types and knowledge domains.\n3. Investigate the distribution of confidence levels in CSC outputs and how they correlate with answer correctness.\n4. Examine cases where CSC significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "1. Vary the number and distribution of confidence levels in the CSC spectrum (e.g., 3 levels vs. 5 levels vs. 7 levels).\n2. Experiment with different phrasings for confidence levels (e.g., numerical vs. verbal descriptions).\n3. Test the impact of including or excluding explanations for confidence assignments."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1: Baseline Failure": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: Provide your answer and a single confidence score between 0-100%.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%",
                "Explanation": "The single-value confidence score fails to capture any nuance in the model's certainty. While the answer is correct, a 100% confidence score suggests absolute certainty, which is rarely justified."
            },
            "Example 2: CSC Success": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: Answer the question and provide your confidence using the following spectrum: 10%: Not confident at all, 30%: Slightly confident, 50%: Moderately confident, 70%: Quite confident, 90%: Very confident. Place your answer at the most appropriate confidence level and explain why.",
                "Output": "A: 90%: Very confident - The capital of France is Paris.\nExplanation: I'm very confident in this answer because it's a widely known fact that Paris is the capital of France. This information is consistently taught in geography classes, appears in numerous official documents, and is a fundamental piece of knowledge about France. However, I've placed it at 90% rather than 100% because there's always a small possibility of human error or a recent, unprecedented change that I might not be aware of.",
                "Explanation": "The CSC method allows for a more nuanced expression of confidence. The model correctly identifies Paris as the capital with high confidence, but also acknowledges a small degree of uncertainty, which is more realistic and human-like."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CSC method doesn't show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why CSC isn't performing as expected. This might involve categorizing the types of questions where CSC struggles and examining the relationship between confidence levels and answer correctness. Second, we could explore variations of the CSC method, such as allowing the model to assign multiple confidence levels to different parts of its answer, or incorporating a meta-confidence score about the model's ability to assess its own confidence. Third, we could shift focus to analyzing how different prompting strategies affect confidence calibration, comparing CSC with other advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency. Finally, we could investigate how CSC performs across different model sizes and architectures, potentially uncovering insights about how model scale relates to uncertainty quantification abilities."
