        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to balance precision and recall in their uncertainty estimates, leading to overconfidence or excessive caution.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-pass confidence estimation or basic calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By iteratively refining uncertainty estimates through a precision-recall lens, we can achieve more balanced and accurate confidence scores.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Iterative Precision-Recall Prompting (IPRP): 1) Initial response generation with a confidence score. 2) Prompt the model to identify potential false positives (overconfidence) in its response. 3) Prompt for potential false negatives (missed information). 4) Ask the model to revise its confidence score based on these considerations. 5) Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence. This method encourages the model to critically examine its own output from multiple angles, leading to more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IPRP against baseline prompting and existing calibration methods on diverse tasks including open-ended question answering and information retrieval. Measure improvements in calibration, precision-recall balance, and correlation between expressed uncertainty and actual performance."

        "Title": "Iterative Precision-Recall Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to balance precision and recall in their uncertainty estimates, leading to overconfidence or excessive caution. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and poor decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-pass confidence estimation or basic calibration techniques, which may not capture the nuanced balance between precision and recall. By iteratively refining uncertainty estimates through a precision-recall lens, we can achieve more balanced and accurate confidence scores. This method encourages the model to critically examine its own output from multiple angles, potentially leading to more nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Iterative Precision-Recall Prompting (IPRP), a multi-step process to refine uncertainty estimates: 1) Initial response generation with a confidence score. 2) Prompt the model to identify potential false positives (overconfidence) in its response. 3) Prompt for potential false negatives (missed information). 4) Ask the model to revise its confidence score based on these considerations. 5) Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets for evaluation, including: a) Open-ended question answering: Natural Questions (NQ) dataset. b) Information retrieval: MS MARCO passage ranking dataset. c) Fact verification: FEVER dataset.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baselines: a) Direct prompting: Ask the model to answer and provide a confidence score. b) Basic calibration: Use temperature scaling on the model's raw logits.",
            "Step 4: IPRP Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of IPRP: a) Initial response: \"Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]\". b) False positive identification: \"Identify potential errors or overconfident statements in your previous answer.\". c) False negative identification: \"What relevant information might you have missed in your initial answer?\". d) Confidence revision: \"Based on the potential errors and missed information, revise your confidence score.\". e) Repeat prompts for steps b-d for 3 iterations or until the confidence score stabilizes (less than 5% change).",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Calibration error: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). b) Precision-Recall AUC: Area under the Precision-Recall curve. c) Confidence-performance correlation: Spearman's rank correlation between confidence scores and actual performance (e.g., F1 score for QA tasks).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run baseline methods and collect results. b) Run IPRP method and collect results. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baseline and IPRP methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare IPRP performance against baselines across all metrics and datasets. b) Analyze the progression of confidence scores and answer quality across iterations. c) Identify patterns in false positive and false negative identifications. d) Investigate cases where IPRP significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95"
            },
            "IPRP Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
                    "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95"
                },
                "Step 2 - False Positive Identification": {
                    "Input": "Identify potential errors or overconfident statements in your previous answer.",
                    "Output": "While I'm highly confident that Paris is the capital of France, I should acknowledge that my confidence score of 95 might be slightly overconfident. There's always a small possibility of recent geopolitical changes or my own knowledge being outdated."
                },
                "Step 3 - False Negative Identification": {
                    "Input": "What relevant information might you have missed in your initial answer?",
                    "Output": "I may have missed mentioning that Paris is not just the political capital but also the cultural and economic capital of France. Additionally, I didn't provide any context about its location, population, or historical significance as the capital."
                },
                "Step 4 - Confidence Revision": {
                    "Input": "Based on the potential errors and missed information, revise your confidence score.",
                    "Output": "Revised confidence score: 92. While I'm still very confident that Paris is the capital of France, I've slightly lowered my confidence score to account for the possibility of outdated information and to acknowledge the additional context I could have provided."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The IPRP method encourages the model to critically examine its initial response, considering both potential errors and missed information. This process leads to a more nuanced confidence score that better reflects the model's true uncertainty, balancing precision (avoiding overconfidence) and recall (acknowledging potentially missed information)."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If IPRP doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of how LLMs reason about their own uncertainty. We could examine the patterns in false positive and false negative identifications across different types of questions and knowledge domains. This analysis could provide insights into the model's metacognitive processes and biases in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we could investigate how the iterative process affects the model's reasoning, even if it doesn't consistently improve quantitative metrics. This could lead to a paper on the qualitative aspects of LLM self-reflection and uncertainty estimation, potentially informing future approaches to improving model calibration and reliability."
