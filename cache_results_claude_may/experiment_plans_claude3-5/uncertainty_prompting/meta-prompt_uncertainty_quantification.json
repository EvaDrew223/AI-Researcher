    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimates, particularly when dealing with novel or complex tasks where the model's own capabilities are uncertain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence estimation or external calibration methods.",
        "Motivation": "We propose to leverage the LLM's meta-cognitive abilities by using the model itself to generate and evaluate prompts for uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "Meta-Prompt Uncertainty Quantification (MPUQ) employs a multi-stage prompting process. First, we prompt the LLM to generate a set of meta-prompts designed to assess its own uncertainty for the given task. These meta-prompts are then used to query the model, generating a diverse set of uncertainty-related outputs. Finally, we use another prompt to synthesize these outputs into a comprehensive uncertainty estimate. This approach allows the model to leverage its own knowledge and reasoning capabilities to probe its uncertainties from multiple angles, potentially uncovering nuanced aspects of uncertainty that predefined prompts might miss.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test MPUQ across a wide range of tasks, including both familiar and novel problem domains. Compare against standard uncertainty estimation techniques in terms of calibration quality, adaptability to new tasks, and the richness of uncertainty information provided. Analyze the generated meta-prompts to gain insights into the model's introspective capabilities."

        "Title": "Meta-Prompt Uncertainty Quantification: Leveraging LLMs' Introspective Abilities for Improved Confidence Calibration",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimates, particularly when dealing with novel or complex tasks where the model's own capabilities are uncertain. This issue can lead to overconfident predictions in areas where the model lacks knowledge or understanding, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence estimation or external calibration methods. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced aspects of uncertainty, especially in novel or complex scenarios. Our proposed Meta-Prompt Uncertainty Quantification (MPUQ) method is inspired by human metacognition, where we reflect on our own knowledge and reasoning processes to assess uncertainty. By leveraging the LLM's ability to generate and evaluate its own prompts for uncertainty assessment, we aim to produce more comprehensive and accurate uncertainty estimates that can adapt to a wide range of tasks and domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "Meta-Prompt Uncertainty Quantification (MPUQ) employs a multi-stage prompting process: 1) Meta-prompt generation: We prompt the LLM to generate a set of meta-prompts designed to assess its own uncertainty for the given task. 2) Uncertainty probing: These meta-prompts are then used to query the model, generating a diverse set of uncertainty-related outputs. 3) Synthesis: We use another prompt to synthesize these outputs into a comprehensive uncertainty estimate. This approach allows the model to leverage its own knowledge and reasoning capabilities to probe its uncertainties from multiple angles, potentially uncovering nuanced aspects of uncertainty that predefined prompts might miss.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of tasks to evaluate MPUQ: 1) Question-answering: SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension. 2) Commonsense reasoning: SWAG dataset. 3) Mathematical reasoning: GSM8K dataset. 4) Out-of-distribution task: Create a custom dataset by combining questions from different domains not typically seen in LLM training data.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Use the LLM's output probability as a confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled. 3) Ensemble of LLMs: Use an ensemble of different LLM checkpoints or architectures. 4) Temperature scaling: Apply post-hoc calibration using temperature scaling.",
            "Step 3: MPUQ Implementation": "Implement the MPUQ method with the following steps: 1) Meta-prompt generation: Prompt: 'Generate 5 different prompts to assess the uncertainty in answering the following question: [QUESTION]'. 2) Uncertainty probing: Use each generated meta-prompt to query the model about its uncertainty. 3) Synthesis: Prompt: 'Based on the following uncertainty assessments, provide a final uncertainty score between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely certain and 1 is completely uncertain: [UNCERTAINTY_ASSESSMENTS]'.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "1) Calibration metrics: Compute Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) for each method. 2) Reliability diagrams: Plot reliability diagrams to visualize calibration performance. 3) Selective prediction: Evaluate the performance of each method when allowed to abstain on uncertain inputs. 4) Out-of-distribution detection: Use AUROC scores to evaluate how well each method distinguishes in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "1) Qualitative analysis: Examine the generated meta-prompts and uncertainty assessments to gain insights into the model's introspective capabilities. 2) Ablation study: Evaluate the impact of the number of meta-prompts and the synthesis step on the final uncertainty estimates. 3) Task-specific analysis: Compare the performance of MPUQ across different task types to identify strengths and weaknesses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPUQ; Step 1: Meta-prompt Generation)": "Generate 5 different prompts to assess the uncertainty in answering the following question: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPUQ; Step 1: Meta-prompt Generation)": "1. How confident are you that you know the correct capital of France?\n2. What factors might make you uncertain about the capital of France?\n3. Can you think of any alternative answers that could potentially be correct?\n4. How would you rate your knowledge of French geography on a scale of 1 to 10?\n5. What sources would you need to consult to be 100% certain of your answer?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPUQ; Step 2: Uncertainty Probing)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you that you know the correct capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPUQ; Step 2: Uncertainty Probing)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am extremely confident in this answer, as it is a well-known fact that is widely taught and referenced. My confidence level would be 9.9 out of 10.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPUQ; Step 3: Synthesis)": "Based on the following uncertainty assessments, provide a final uncertainty score between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely certain and 1 is completely uncertain: [Include all responses from Step 2]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPUQ; Step 3: Synthesis)": "Final uncertainty score: 0.01. The responses consistently indicate a high level of confidence in the answer, with multiple sources of knowledge and no significant factors causing uncertainty. The slight uncertainty (0.01) accounts for the small possibility of human error or extremely rare geopolitical changes.",
            "Explanation": "MPUQ provides a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of uncertainty compared to direct confidence estimation. It considers multiple aspects of uncertainty and allows the model to introspect on its knowledge and potential sources of error."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MPUQ does not show significant improvements over baseline methods, we can explore the following alternatives: 1) Analyze the generated meta-prompts to understand if they are effectively probing different aspects of uncertainty. If not, we can experiment with providing more structured guidance for meta-prompt generation. 2) Investigate the synthesis step to see if it's effectively combining the individual uncertainty assessments. We could explore different aggregation methods, such as weighted averaging based on the relevance of each assessment. 3) Extend the project to focus on analyzing the model's introspective capabilities across different tasks and domains. This could provide valuable insights into how LLMs reason about their own knowledge and uncertainties, even if it doesn't immediately lead to improved calibration. 4) Explore combining MPUQ with existing calibration methods, such as using the MPUQ output as an input feature for a calibration model. This hybrid approach might leverage the strengths of both introspective and external calibration methods."
