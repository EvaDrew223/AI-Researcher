        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simplistic scalar confidence scores, which fail to capture the multidimensional nature of model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like temperature scaling or ensemble disagreement to produce single-dimensional confidence estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by manifold learning in machine learning, we posit that model uncertainty exists in a high-dimensional space that can be better explored and quantified.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Manifold Exploration (CME), a novel prompting technique that iteratively probes the LLM's uncertainty landscape. CME starts with an initial prompt and systematically generates a series of related prompts that explore different facets of the model's uncertainty. These prompts are designed to traverse the hypothetical 'confidence manifold' by varying aspects such as question specificity, domain knowledge required, and reasoning complexity. The LLM's responses to these prompts are then aggregated using dimensionality reduction techniques to create a low-dimensional representation of the model's uncertainty. This manifold can be visualized and analyzed to provide a richer, more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence across different dimensions of the problem space.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CME against baseline methods like temperature scaling and ensemble disagreement on a range of tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and multi-hop inference. We'll use metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) to assess calibration quality. Additionally, we'll conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated confidence manifolds to gain insights into the multidimensional nature of LLM uncertainty."

        "Title": "Confidence Manifold Exploration: A Novel Prompting Method for Multidimensional Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic scalar confidence scores, which fail to capture the multidimensional nature of model uncertainty. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess and interpret the reliability of LLM outputs across different aspects of the problem space.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use techniques like temperature scaling or ensemble disagreement to produce single-dimensional confidence estimates. These methods, while useful, do not fully capture the complex nature of LLM uncertainty. Inspired by manifold learning in machine learning, we posit that model uncertainty exists in a high-dimensional space that can be better explored and quantified. By developing a method to probe this 'confidence manifold', we aim to provide a richer, more nuanced understanding of LLM uncertainty, which could lead to more reliable and interpretable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Manifold Exploration (CME), a novel prompting technique that iteratively probes the LLM's uncertainty landscape.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for our experiments: (1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, (2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and (3) HotpotQA for multi-hop inference. These datasets cover a range of task types and complexities.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature values (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during generation and calculate the entropy of the output distribution as a confidence score. (2) Ensemble disagreement: Use 5 different decoding paths (e.g., different random seeds) and calculate the variance of the outputs as a confidence score.",
            "Step 3: CME Implementation": "Implement the Confidence Manifold Exploration method: (a) For each input question, generate 10 related prompts that vary in specificity, required domain knowledge, and reasoning complexity. (b) Obtain LLM responses for each of these prompts. (c) Extract features from these responses (e.g., response length, perplexity, entity overlap with the question). (d) Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) to create a 2D or 3D representation of the confidence manifold.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of CME against the baselines using the following metrics: (1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), (2) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), (3) Brier Score. Additionally, conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated confidence manifolds to gain insights into the multidimensional nature of LLM uncertainty.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CME against the baselines across different task types and model sizes. Analyze how the confidence manifold varies across different types of questions and identify any patterns or clusters in the manifold that correspond to specific types of uncertainty."

                "Confidence Score": "0.95 (high confidence based on low output entropy)"
            },

                    "Q1: What year did the first moon landing occur?",

                    "Q4: How many people in total have walked on the moon?",
                    "Q5: What was the name of the lunar module used in the Apollo 11 mission?"

                    "A1: The first moon landing occurred in 1969.",

                    "A4: A total of 12 people have walked on the moon.",

                "Confidence Manifold": "A 2D plot showing the distribution of responses in the reduced feature space, with clusters indicating areas of high and low confidence across different aspects of the question.",
                "Explanation": "The CME method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence. While the model shows high confidence in the basic facts (year, Armstrong's quote), there's more uncertainty in the comprehensive knowledge (all Apollo missions, total moonwalkers). This multidimensional confidence representation allows for a more detailed understanding of the model's knowledge and uncertainties compared to the scalar confidence score from temperature scaling."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CME method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated confidence manifolds to identify patterns in LLM uncertainty across different question types and domains. This could provide valuable insights into the nature of LLM knowledge and uncertainty, even if it doesn't immediately translate to better calibration metrics. Second, we could explore hybrid approaches that combine CME with existing methods like temperature scaling or ensemble disagreement. For instance, we could use the confidence manifold to inform the selection of ensemble members or to dynamically adjust the temperature parameter. Finally, we could investigate whether the CME method, while not improving overall calibration, is particularly effective for certain subsets of questions or domains. This could lead to a more nuanced approach where different uncertainty quantification methods are applied based on the characteristics of the input question."
