        "Problem": "Large language models often provide single-perspective uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the full range of potential interpretations and knowledge sources.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-model uncertainty estimation or simple ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "In complex scenarios, human experts often consult multiple perspectives and sources to gauge uncertainty more comprehensively. We can potentially improve LLM uncertainty quantification by simulating this multi-perspective approach.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Perspective Ensemble Uncertainty (MPEU), a prompting technique that leverages a single LLM to simulate multiple expert perspectives: 1) Perspective Generation: Prompt the model to identify relevant expert roles for the given task (e.g., historian, economist, ethicist). 2) Role-Playing: For each perspective, prompt the model to assume the role and provide an answer with uncertainty estimate. 3) Cross-Examination: Have each 'expert' generate questions for the others, creating a simulated panel discussion. 4) Synthesis: Prompt the model to aggregate insights from all perspectives, highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. 5) Meta-Analysis: Finally, prompt the model to provide an overall uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diversity of perspectives and the strength of consensus or disagreement.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MPEU with standard single-perspective uncertainty estimation and basic ensemble methods on a variety of tasks, including interdisciplinary problems, ethical dilemmas, and complex real-world scenarios. Evaluate using metrics for calibration, comprehensive uncertainty coverage, and correlation with panels of human experts."

        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Ensemble Uncertainty: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide single-perspective uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the full range of potential interpretations and knowledge sources, leading to overconfident or miscalibrated predictions in complex scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically rely on single-model uncertainty estimation or simple ensemble methods, which may not adequately capture the nuanced uncertainties present in complex, interdisciplinary problems. Human experts often consult multiple perspectives and sources to gauge uncertainty more comprehensively. By simulating this multi-perspective approach within a single LLM, we can potentially improve uncertainty quantification without the need for multiple models or extensive computational resources.",

            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Ask the model to answer the question and provide an uncertainty estimate. b) Ensemble method: Use multiple completions from the same model and aggregate results. c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with uncertainty: Use CoT prompting and ask for an uncertainty estimate at the end.",
            "Step 3: MPEU Implementation": "Implement the MPEU method with the following steps: a) Perspective Generation: 'For the given question, identify 3-5 relevant expert roles that would be best suited to answer this question.' b) Role-Playing: 'Assume the role of [expert]. Answer the question and provide an uncertainty estimate on a scale of 0-100%.' c) Cross-Examination: 'As [expert A], what question would you ask [expert B] to challenge or clarify their answer?' d) Synthesis: 'Summarize the key points of agreement and disagreement among the experts.' e) Meta-Analysis: 'Based on the expert opinions and discussion, provide an overall answer and uncertainty estimate, explaining how the diversity of perspectives influenced your final estimate.'",

            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit domain experts to rate a subset of answers and uncertainty estimates from both baseline methods and MPEU on: a) Answer quality b) Uncertainty estimate reasonableness c) Comprehensiveness of considered perspectives",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing or modifying components of MPEU: a) Vary the number of expert perspectives b) Remove the cross-examination step c) Use a single aggregate uncertainty estimate instead of per-expert estimates",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of results: a) Compare MPEU performance against baselines across different task types b) Analyze how MPEU performance varies with task complexity c) Investigate correlations between diversity of expert opinions and overall uncertainty estimates d) Examine cases where MPEU significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines"

Changes in urban planning and real estate values\n5. New industries emerging around autonomous vehicle technology\n\nUncertainty estimate: 70%\n\nThis is a complex issue with many variables, and the full impacts may not be clear for many years, hence the relatively high uncertainty.",

Significant reduction in transportation costs, potentially by 40-60%, due to increased efficiency and reduced labor costs.\n2. Reshaping of the labor market with potential job losses in driving-related professions, but new job creation in AV technology and maintenance.\n3. Increased productivity due to people being able to work or engage in other activities while in transit.\n4. Potential reduction in public transportation usage, affecting urban economics and public funding.\n5. Changes in land use patterns, potentially leading to urban sprawl as commute times become less burdensome.\n6. Reduction in costs associated with traffic accidents, which currently account for a significant economic burden.\n7. Potential growth in certain sectors like e-commerce and last-mile delivery services.\n\nUncertainty estimate: 65%\n\nThe uncertainty is relatively high because while we can predict some impacts based on economic models, the widespread adoption of AVs represents a significant shift that could have unforeseen consequences. Factors such as the speed of adoption, regulatory changes, and potential new use cases for AVs could all significantly influence the economic impacts.",

However, couldn't autonomous vehicles also enable more efficient use of urban space, potentially leading to denser, more sustainable cities? For instance, with reduced need for parking spaces and more efficient traffic flow, couldn't we see a trend towards urban densification rather than sprawl? How would this alternative scenario impact your economic projections?\"",

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPEU; Step 5: Meta-Analysis)": "Overall answer: The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles is likely to have far-reaching and complex economic impacts across multiple sectors. Key effects are expected to include:\n1. Significant reduction in transportation costs (estimated 40-60%)\n2. Major labor market shifts, with job losses in driving-related professions but new job creation in AV technology, maintenance, and related fields\n3. Increased overall productivity due to repurposed travel time\n4.

Long-term reduction in costs associated with traffic accidents\n\nUncertainty estimate: 75%\n\nExplanation of uncertainty estimate:\nThe diversity of expert perspectives highlighted the complexity and interconnectedness of the potential economic impacts. While there was general agreement on some broad trends (e.g., reduced transportation costs, labor market shifts), the specific magnitude and direction of these changes remain highly uncertain. Key factors contributing to this high uncertainty include:\n\n1. Varying timelines for AV adoption across different regions and sectors\n2. Uncertainty about consumer acceptance and behavior changes\n3. The potential for unforeseen technological developments or use cases\n4. The critical role of government regulation in shaping outcomes\n5. Disagreement among experts on urban development trends (sprawl vs. densification)\n6. The potential for cascading effects across multiple economic sectors\n\nThe Transportation Economist provided valuable insights into direct economic impacts, while the Urban Planner highlighted important considerations about land use and city development. The Automotive Industry Analyst brought attention to the complex dynamics of AV adoption and industry transformation. The Labor Market Specialist emphasized the nuanced effects on employment, and the Technology Futurist introduced potential long-term scenarios and unforeseen innovations.\n\nThis multi-perspective approach revealed a wider range of potential outcomes than any single expert could provide, leading to a higher overall uncertainty estimate. The interplay between technological, economic, social, and regulatory factors creates a complex system with many possible trajectories, necessitating a cautious and nuanced view of the long-term economic impacts of autonomous vehicles.",
            "explanation": "The MPEU method provides a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of the potential economic impacts of autonomous vehicles compared to the baseline method. By incorporating multiple expert perspectives, cross-examination, and synthesis, it captures a wider range of potential outcomes and sources of uncertainty. The final meta-analysis offers a more robust uncertainty estimate that accounts for the diversity of expert opinions and the complexity of the issue."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MPEU method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why MPEU fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in simulating expert reasoning. 2) Explore variations of the MPEU method, such as iterative refinement of expert opinions or incorporating external knowledge sources to supplement the LLM's knowledge. 3) Investigate whether MPEU performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Analyze the quality and diversity of the generated expert perspectives to understand if the method's performance is limited by the LLM's ability to simulate diverse viewpoints. 5) Compare the uncertainty estimates generated by MPEU with those of human expert panels, which could provide insights into how well LLMs can approximate human expert reasoning in complex scenarios. This analysis could form the basis of a paper on the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in expert simulation and uncertainty quantification."
