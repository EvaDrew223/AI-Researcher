        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex multi-step reasoning tasks where errors can compound.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling or ensemble disagreement often treat uncertainty as a global property of the model output.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by divide-and-conquer algorithms, we hypothesize that breaking down complex reasoning into atomic steps and recursively quantifying uncertainty for each step could lead to more fine-grained and accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Confidence Dissection (RCD), a novel prompting method that recursively breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-queries, quantifies uncertainty for each sub-query, and then aggregates these uncertainties. The process involves: 1) Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the main query into a tree of simpler sub-queries. 2) Atomic Confidence Estimation: For each leaf node (atomic sub-query), prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: Recursively aggregate confidences up the tree, using prompts that guide the model to combine child node uncertainties based on their logical relationships. 4) Final Synthesis: Prompt the model to provide a final answer and overall uncertainty estimate based on the propagated confidences.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare RCD against standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought, and existing uncertainty quantification methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH. Evaluate using calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error) and the quality of uncertainty-based selective prediction."

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Dissection: Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex multi-step reasoning tasks where errors can compound. Current approaches like temperature scaling or ensemble disagreement often treat uncertainty as a global property of the model output, lacking fine-grained uncertainty estimates for intermediate reasoning steps.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by divide-and-conquer algorithms, we hypothesize that breaking down complex reasoning into atomic steps and recursively quantifying uncertainty for each step could lead to more fine-grained and accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach mimics human problem-solving, where we often break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems and assess our confidence at each step. By doing so, we aim to provide more interpretable and actionable uncertainty estimates, potentially improving the model's overall performance and reliability on complex reasoning tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Confidence Dissection (RCD), a novel prompting method that recursively breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-queries, quantifies uncertainty for each sub-query, and then aggregates these uncertainties. The process involves four main steps: 1) Decomposition: Prompt the model to break down the main query into a tree of simpler sub-queries. 2) Atomic Confidence Estimation: For each leaf node (atomic sub-query), prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. 3) Uncertainty Propagation: Recursively aggregate confidences up the tree, using prompts that guide the model to combine child node uncertainties based on their logical relationships. 4) Final Synthesis: Prompt the model to provide a final answer and overall uncertainty estimate based on the propagated confidences.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets: 1) GSM8K for multi-step math word problems. 2) MATH dataset for more advanced mathematical reasoning. 3) StrategyQA for multi-hop reasoning in open-domain question answering.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines: 1) Standard prompting: Directly ask the model to solve the problem and provide a confidence score. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use few-shot CoT prompts and ask for a final confidence score. 3) Self-consistency: Generate multiple CoT samples and use their agreement as a measure of confidence.",
            "Step 3: RCD Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Confidence Dissection method: 1) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down this problem into simpler sub-problems. Organize them in a tree structure.' 2) Atomic Confidence Estimation prompt: 'Solve this sub-problem and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.' 3) Uncertainty Propagation prompt: 'Given the confidences of the sub-problems, estimate the confidence for this higher-level problem.' 4) Final Synthesis prompt: 'Based on all the sub-problem solutions and confidences, provide a final answer and overall confidence score.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. 2) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess how well the confidence scores align with actual accuracies. 3) Selective Accuracy: Evaluate accuracy on the top-k most confident predictions for various k. 4) AUROC: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run all baselines and the RCD method on the test set. 2) Collect final answers, confidence scores, and intermediate reasoning steps. 3) Calculate all evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare RCD against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze the structure of decomposed sub-problems. 3) Investigate how confidence propagates through the reasoning tree. 4) Identify patterns in problems where RCD outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Q: If the average of 5 numbers is 12, and 4 of those numbers are 10, 11, 13, and 15, what is the 5th number? Also, provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "To find the 5th number, let's follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the sum of all 5 numbers: 12 (average) \u00d7 5 = 60\n2. Sum the known 4 numbers: 10 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 49\n3. Subtract to find the 5th number: 60 - 49 = 11\n\nTherefore, the 5th number is 11.\n\nConfidence score: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Q: If the average of 5 numbers is 12, and 4 of those numbers are 10, 11, 13, and 15, what is the 5th number? Break down this problem into simpler sub-problems. Organize them in a tree structure.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Problem Tree:\n1. Calculate the sum of all 5 numbers\n   1.1 Multiply the average by the count of numbers\n2. Calculate the sum of the 4 known numbers\n3. Find the 5th number\n   3.1 Subtract the sum of 4 known numbers from the total sum",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD; Step 2: Atomic Confidence Estimation)": "Solve this sub-problem and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1: Multiply the average (12) by the count of numbers (5).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCD; Step 2: Atomic Confidence Estimation)": "12 \u00d7 5 = 60\nConfidence: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "Given the confidences of the sub-problems (1.1: 0.99, 2: 0.98, 3.1: 0.97), estimate the confidence for the higher-level problem of finding the 5th number.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (RCD; Step 3: Uncertainty Propagation)": "To estimate the overall confidence, we need to consider how errors might propagate:\n1. The calculation of the total sum (1.1) is very reliable (0.99).\n2. The sum of known numbers (2) is also highly reliable (0.98).\n3. The final subtraction (3.1) is slightly less certain (0.97).\n\nSince all steps are necessary and errors could compound, we should be conservative. A reasonable estimate would be to multiply these confidences:\n\n0.99 \u00d7 0.98 \u00d7 0.97 \u2248 0.94\n\nTherefore, the estimated confidence for finding the 5th number is 0.94.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCD; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on all the sub-problem solutions and confidences, provide a final answer for the 5th number and an overall confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (RCD; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The 5th number is 11.\n\nReasoning:\n1. Sum of all 5 numbers: 12 \u00d7 5 = 60 (confidence: 0.99)\n2. Sum of 4 known numbers: 10 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 49 (confidence: 0.98)\n3. 5th number: 60 - 49 = 11 (confidence: 0.97)\n\nOverall Confidence Score: 0.94\n\nThe high confidence in each step and their logical combination gives us a strong overall confidence in the final answer.",
            "explanation": "RCD provides a more detailed and transparent reasoning process, breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This allows for more precise confidence estimation at each step, leading to a well-justified final confidence score. The standard prompting approach, while correct, doesn't provide this level of granularity in its reasoning or confidence estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RCD method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot our analysis to understand why. We could examine: 1) The quality and consistency of problem decompositions across different queries. 2) The accuracy of atomic confidence estimations compared to actual performance on those sub-tasks. 3) How well the uncertainty propagation aligns with human intuition about error propagation in multi-step reasoning. 4) Whether certain types of problems benefit more from RCD than others. This analysis could lead to insights about the strengths and limitations of LLMs in meta-cognitive tasks like uncertainty estimation and problem decomposition. We could also explore variations of the RCD method, such as using different prompting strategies for decomposition or confidence estimation, or incorporating external knowledge sources for verification of atomic sub-problems. Additionally, we could investigate how RCD performs when combined with other techniques like few-shot learning or self-consistency, potentially leading to a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of multiple methods."
