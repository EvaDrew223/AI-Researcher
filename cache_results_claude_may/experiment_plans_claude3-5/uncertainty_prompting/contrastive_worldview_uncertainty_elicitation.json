    "idea_name": "Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty Elicitation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often fail to recognize the extent of their uncertainty when answering questions that require broad world knowledge or understanding of diverse perspectives.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current uncertainty quantification methods typically focus on model internals or output distributions, without explicitly considering the impact of different worldviews or knowledge bases.",
        "Motivation": "By exposing the model to contrasting worldviews or knowledge bases, we can elicit a more comprehensive understanding of its uncertainty across different perspectives.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty Elicitation (CWUE), a prompting technique that presents the model with multiple, contrasting 'expert personas' to answer the same question. Each persona represents a distinct worldview or knowledge base (e.g., different academic disciplines, cultural backgrounds, or historical periods). The model is prompted to answer the question from each persona's perspective, explicitly stating assumptions and limitations. CWUE then analyzes the divergence between these answers to quantify uncertainty. Areas of agreement across personas indicate higher certainty, while disagreements or contradictions signal uncertainty. The final output includes a synthesized answer, an uncertainty score based on inter-persona disagreement, and a breakdown of key points of contention.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CWUE on a diverse set of questions spanning multiple domains (science, history, culture, ethics) against baselines of standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods. We will assess both the quality of uncertainty estimates and the richness of the uncertainty breakdowns using expert human evaluation and newly developed metrics for multi-perspective coherence."

        "Title": "Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty Elicitation: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Perspective Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often fail to recognize the extent of their uncertainty when answering questions that require broad world knowledge or understanding of diverse perspectives. This can lead to overconfident responses in areas where the model's knowledge is limited or biased.",
        "Motivation": "Current uncertainty quantification methods typically focus on model internals or output distributions, without explicitly considering the impact of different worldviews or knowledge bases. By exposing the model to contrasting worldviews or knowledge bases, we can elicit a more comprehensive understanding of its uncertainty across different perspectives. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason from multiple viewpoints, potentially providing a more nuanced and accurate assessment of its uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty Elicitation (CWUE), a prompting technique that presents the model with multiple, contrasting 'expert personas' to answer the same question.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions spanning multiple domains (science, history, culture, ethics) from existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, AmbigQA, and MultiArith. Ensure the questions have varying levels of difficulty and potential for diverse perspectives.",
            "Step 2: Define Expert Personas": "Create a set of 5-7 expert personas, each representing a distinct worldview or knowledge base. Examples include: 'Modern Scientist', 'Historian', 'Philosopher', 'Indigenous Knowledge Keeper', 'Tech Entrepreneur', 'Environmental Activist', and 'Religious Scholar'.",
            "Step 3: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods as baselines. These should include: (a) Direct prompting, (b) Few-shot prompting, (c) Chain-of-Thought prompting, and (d) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 4: Implement CWUE Prompting": "Develop the CWUE prompting technique. The prompt structure should be: 'Question: [INSERT QUESTION]\n\nPlease answer this question from the perspective of the following experts, stating any assumptions or limitations:\n\n1. [Expert 1]: [Answer]\nAssumptions/Limitations: [List]\n\n2. [Expert 2]: [Answer]\nAssumptions/Limitations: [List]\n\n...\n\nBased on these expert opinions, provide a synthesized answer, an uncertainty score (0-100), and a breakdown of key points of contention.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude 2 from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Run Experiments": "For each question in the dataset, apply both baseline methods and CWUE. Collect the outputs, including answers, uncertainty scores, and reasoning steps where applicable.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (a) Answer quality: Use GPT-4 as a judge to rate answer quality on a scale of 1-5, (b) Uncertainty calibration: Compare model uncertainty scores with human expert ratings of question difficulty, (c) Multi-perspective coherence: Develop a metric to measure the diversity and relevance of perspectives provided by CWUE.",
            "Step 8: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (50-100 questions) with domain experts to assess the quality of uncertainty quantification and the usefulness of the multi-perspective breakdowns.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Perform statistical analysis to compare CWUE with baselines. Analyze performance across different question types and domains. Investigate correlations between inter-persona disagreement and actual uncertainty.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the number and types of expert personas, and by modifying the prompt structure to understand the impact of different components of CWUE."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What are the potential long-term effects of artificial intelligence on human employment?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The potential long-term effects of artificial intelligence on human employment are likely to be significant and wide-ranging. AI is expected to automate many tasks currently performed by humans, potentially leading to job displacement in certain sectors. However, it may also create new job opportunities in fields related to AI development and maintenance. Overall, AI is likely to reshape the job market, requiring workers to adapt and acquire new skills to remain competitive.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Question: What are the potential long-term effects of artificial intelligence on human employment?\n\nPlease answer this question from the perspective of the following experts, stating any assumptions or limitations:\n\n1. Tech Entrepreneur:\n2. Labor Economist:\n3. Futurist:\n4. Sociologist:\n5. Ethicist:\n\nBased on these expert opinions, provide a synthesized answer, an uncertainty score (0-100), and a breakdown of key points of contention.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Tech Entrepreneur: AI will create more jobs than it displaces by driving innovation and new industries. We'll see a shift towards creative and strategic roles that AI can't easily replicate.\nAssumptions/Limitations: Assumes continued rapid AI advancement and economic growth.\n\n2. Labor Economist: AI will likely lead to significant job displacement in routine cognitive and manual tasks. While new jobs will be created, there's a risk of increasing inequality and structural unemployment.\nAssumptions/Limitations: Based on historical patterns of technological change; may not account for unprecedented AI capabilities.\n\n3. Futurist: In the long term, AI could lead to a post-scarcity economy where traditional employment becomes obsolete. We may need to redefine the concept of work and implement universal basic income.\nAssumptions/Limitations: Speculative long-term view; assumes continued exponential growth in AI capabilities.\n\n4. Sociologist: The impact of AI on employment will vary greatly across different socioeconomic groups and regions. We may see increased social stratification and changes in social mobility patterns.\nAssumptions/Limitations: Based on current social trends; may not account for potential societal paradigm shifts.\n\n5. Ethicist: The effects of AI on employment raise important ethical questions about the value of work, fair distribution of AI-generated wealth, and human dignity. We need to ensure that AI benefits all of humanity, not just a select few.\nAssumptions/Limitations: Assumes current ethical frameworks will apply; may not account for potential shifts in human values.\n\nSynthesized Answer: The long-term effects of AI on human employment are likely to be profound and multifaceted. While there's potential for significant job displacement in certain sectors, particularly those involving routine tasks, AI is also expected to create new job opportunities and potentially reshape our entire concept of work. The impact will likely be unevenly distributed, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities. As AI capabilities grow, we may need to adapt our economic systems and social policies to ensure a fair distribution of benefits and maintain human dignity in a changing job landscape.\n\nUncertainty Score: 75\n\nKey Points of Contention:\n1. Job creation vs. job displacement: Experts disagree on whether AI will create more jobs than it eliminates.\n2. Timeframe and extent of impact: Views range from near-term job market shifts to long-term post-scarcity scenarios.\n3. Economic implications: There's uncertainty about whether AI will lead to greater prosperity for all or increased inequality.\n4. Societal adaptation: Experts differ on how effectively society will adapt to AI-driven changes in the job market.\n5. Ethical considerations: There's debate about how to balance technological progress with maintaining human dignity and purpose in work.",
            "Explanation": "The CWUE method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the potential impacts of AI on employment. By incorporating multiple expert perspectives, it highlights areas of agreement and disagreement, providing a clearer picture of the uncertainties involved. The synthesized answer reflects this complexity, and the uncertainty score and breakdown of contentious points offer valuable additional context that is missing from the baseline output."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CWUE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of why multi-perspective prompting fails to improve uncertainty quantification. This could involve: 1) Analyzing the diversity and relevance of perspectives generated by different expert personas to understand if the method is truly capturing diverse viewpoints. 2) Investigating whether the model is able to maintain consistent persona-specific knowledge across different questions, which could provide insights into the model's knowledge representation. 3) Examining the relationship between inter-persona disagreement and actual uncertainty or difficulty of questions, which could reveal limitations in using disagreement as a proxy for uncertainty. 4) Conducting a detailed error analysis to categorize the types of questions or domains where CWUE performs poorly, potentially uncovering specific weaknesses in the approach or in the model's knowledge. 5) Exploring alternative ways of aggregating multi-perspective information, such as weighted averaging based on perceived expertise or confidence. These analyses could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of using LLMs for multi-perspective reasoning and uncertainty quantification, potentially leading to the development of improved methods or a better understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations."
