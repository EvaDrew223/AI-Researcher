    "idea_name": "Uncertainty Stratification Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty across different domains and types of questions, leading to miscalibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods provide overall calibration but fail to capture nuanced uncertainty differences across question types.",
        "Motivation": "Different types of questions inherently have varying levels of difficulty and uncertainty. By explicitly prompting models to consider these differences, we can obtain more fine-grained and accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Stratification Prompting (USP), a novel technique that decomposes questions into distinct strata based on their inherent uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Prompt the model to categorize the input question into predefined uncertainty strata (e.g., 'factual', 'inferential', 'speculative'). 2) For each stratum, provide tailored sub-prompts that guide the model to consider specific uncertainty factors relevant to that category. 3) Aggregate the stratified uncertainty estimates using a learned weighting scheme to produce a final calibrated confidence score. This method enables models to reason about uncertainty in a more structured and domain-aware manner.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate USP against standard prompting and existing calibration methods on diverse question-answering datasets spanning multiple domains. Measure performance using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score, with a particular focus on calibration across different question types."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Stratification Prompting: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty across different domains and types of questions, leading to miscalibrated confidence estimates. This issue can result in unreliable outputs and potentially harmful decisions when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods provide overall calibration but fail to capture nuanced uncertainty differences across question types. Different types of questions inherently have varying levels of difficulty and uncertainty. By explicitly prompting models to consider these differences, we can obtain more fine-grained and accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning capabilities to improve its calibration, without requiring extensive retraining or external calibration models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Stratification Prompting (USP), a novel technique that decomposes questions into distinct strata based on their inherent uncertainty. The process involves three main steps: 1) Prompt the model to categorize the input question into predefined uncertainty strata (e.g., 'factual', 'inferential', 'speculative'). 2) For each stratum, provide tailored sub-prompts that guide the model to consider specific uncertainty factors relevant to that category. 3) Aggregate the stratified uncertainty estimates using a learned weighting scheme to produce a final calibrated confidence score. This method enables models to reason about uncertainty in a more structured and domain-aware manner.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use diverse question-answering datasets spanning multiple domains: TriviaQA for factual questions, RACE for inferential questions, and ARC-Challenge for more speculative scientific reasoning. Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and existing calibration methods as baselines: (a) Direct prompting, (b) Temperature scaling, (c) Ensemble method (using different seeds or model versions).",
            "Step 3: USP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Stratification Prompting method: (a) Design prompts for uncertainty stratification, (b) Create tailored sub-prompts for each stratum, (c) Implement the aggregation mechanism.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Training Phase": "Using the training set, fine-tune the aggregation weights for combining stratum-specific uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate all methods on the test set using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score. Pay particular attention to calibration across different question types.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis of the results, including: (a) Comparison of USP against baselines, (b) Performance breakdown by question type and uncertainty stratum, (c) Qualitative analysis of model-generated uncertainty explanations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Stratification)": "Categorize the following question into one of these uncertainty strata: factual, inferential, or speculative. Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Stratification)": "Uncertainty stratum: factual",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Stratum-specific reasoning)": "This is a factual question. Consider the following factors to assess your uncertainty: 1) How commonly known is this fact? 2) Is there any potential for recent changes or disputes? 3) Are there any similar facts that might cause confusion? Now, answer the question and provide your confidence level (0-100%): What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Stratum-specific reasoning)": "Answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99% Reasoning: 1) This is an extremely well-known fact taught in basic geography. 2) The capital of France has been stable for centuries, with no recent changes or disputes. 3) While there are other major cities in France like Lyon or Marseille, they are not commonly confused with the capital.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Aggregation)": "Given the stratum-specific confidence of 99% for this factual question, and considering the general reliability of factual knowledge, provide a final calibrated confidence score (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Aggregation)": "Final calibrated confidence: 98%",
            "Explanation": "The USP method provides a more nuanced and justified confidence estimate by explicitly considering the question type and relevant uncertainty factors. The slight reduction in confidence from 99% to 98% in the final step reflects a conservative adjustment to account for the small possibility of model error even in highly confident factual answers."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed USP method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how different question types and domains affect model calibration, potentially revealing insights about model behavior and limitations. 2) Experiment with different stratification schemes or more fine-grained uncertainty categories to see if a more detailed breakdown improves performance. 3) Investigate the effectiveness of the stratum-specific reasoning prompts and iterate on their design. 4) Explore combining USP with other calibration methods like temperature scaling or ensembling to create a hybrid approach. 5) Analyze cases where USP performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the method and propose improvements."
