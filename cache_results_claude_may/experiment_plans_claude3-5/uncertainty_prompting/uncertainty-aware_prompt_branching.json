    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different knowledge domains and question types.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single-path reasoning or limited self-consistency checks.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by decision trees in machine learning, we propose a novel prompting method that explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously to better capture model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Branching (UAPB), a multi-step prompting technique that dynamically generates and explores branching reasoning paths. For a given query, UAPB first prompts the model to identify key decision points or areas of uncertainty. At each decision point, the model generates multiple alternative hypotheses or reasoning steps. These branches are then explored in parallel, with the model assigning confidence scores to each path. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the structure and confidence distribution of the resulting tree. This approach allows for a more nuanced capture of uncertainty across different aspects of the problem.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare UAPB against standard prompting, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency methods on diverse question-answering datasets spanning factual knowledge, reasoning tasks, and open-ended questions. Evaluate using calibration metrics, selective accuracy, and human expert assessment of uncertainty justifications."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Branching: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different knowledge domains and question types. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions on tasks where the model's knowledge is limited or ambiguous, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-path reasoning or limited self-consistency checks, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty. Inspired by decision trees in machine learning, we propose a novel prompting method that explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously to better capture model uncertainty. This approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the model's confidence across different aspects of a given problem.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Branching (UAPB), a multi-step prompting technique that dynamically generates and explores branching reasoning paths. For a given query, UAPB first prompts the model to identify key decision points or areas of uncertainty. At each decision point, the model generates multiple alternative hypotheses or reasoning steps. These branches are then explored in parallel, with the model assigning confidence scores to each path. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from the structure and confidence distribution of the resulting tree. This approach allows for a more nuanced capture of uncertainty across different aspects of the problem.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets spanning factual knowledge, reasoning tasks, and open-ended questions. We will use: (1) TriviaQA for factual knowledge, (2) MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning, and (3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and self-consistency methods as baselines. For standard prompting, directly ask the question. For CoT, append 'Let's approach this step by step:' to the question. For self-consistency, generate multiple CoT responses and aggregate them.",
            "Step 3: UAPB Implementation": "Implement the UAPB method with the following sub-steps: (a) Identify decision points: Prompt the model to list key uncertainties or decision points for the given question. (b) Generate branches: For each decision point, prompt the model to generate multiple alternative hypotheses or reasoning steps. (c) Explore branches: Prompt the model to reason along each branch, assigning confidence scores. (d) Aggregate results: Combine the branching structure and confidence scores to produce a final answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Assess performance using the following metrics: (1) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. (2) Calibration: Use expected calibration error (ECE) to evaluate how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. (3) Selective accuracy: Measure accuracy on the top-k% most confident predictions. (4) Uncertainty quality: Use proper scoring rules like Brier score or log loss to assess the quality of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation on a subset of examples to assess the quality and interpretability of the uncertainty justifications provided by UAPB compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: (a) Compare UAPB performance against baselines across different question types and difficulty levels. (b) Analyze the branching structures produced by UAPB to identify common patterns or insights. (c) Investigate cases where UAPB significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1: Baseline Failure": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Standard Prompt Output": "The capital of France is Paris.",
                "CoT Prompt Output": "Let's approach this step by step:\n1. France is a country in Western Europe.\n2. It has a long history and has had several capitals throughout its history.\n3. However, since 1944, there has been a consistent capital.\n4. This city is widely known and is often called the 'City of Light'.\n5. It's famous for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.\nTherefore, the capital of France is Paris.",
                "Self-Consistency Output": "After generating 5 responses:\nParis (5/5 responses)\nFinal answer: Paris\nConfidence: High",
                "Explanation": "While all baseline methods provide the correct answer, they fail to express any uncertainty. This can be problematic for more ambiguous questions where the model might not have high confidence."
            },
            "Example 2: UAPB Success": {
                "Input": "Q: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2023?",
                "UAPB Step 1 (Identify decision points) Output": "Key uncertainties:\n1. The specific year (2023) - Nobel Prizes are awarded annually, but I might not have the most up-to-date information.\n2. The field (Physics) - There are multiple Nobel Prize categories.\n3. The number of winners - Nobel Prizes can be awarded to up to three individuals in a given year.\n4. The identities of the winners - This requires specific knowledge of recent scientific achievements and recognition.",
                "UAPB Step 2 (Generate branches) Output": "For uncertainty 4 (identities of winners), possible branches:\nA. The prize was awarded for work on quantum information science.\nB. The prize was awarded for advancements in particle physics.\nC. The prize was awarded for discoveries in cosmology or astrophysics.\nD. The prize was awarded for developments in applied physics or technology.",
                "UAPB Step 3 (Explore branches) Output": "Branch A (quantum information science):\nPossible winners: Anton Zeilinger, John Clauser, Alain Aspect\nConfidence: 60%\nReasoning: These scientists made significant contributions to quantum entanglement and information, which has been a hot topic in recent years.\n\nBranch B (particle physics):\nPossible winners: [No specific names]\nConfidence: 20%\nReasoning: While particle physics is an important field, I'm less certain about recent groundbreaking discoveries that would warrant a Nobel Prize in 2023.\n\nBranch C (cosmology/astrophysics):\nPossible winners: [No specific names]\nConfidence: 15%\nReasoning: There have been exciting developments in cosmology, but I'm not confident about specific achievements that would lead to a 2023 Nobel Prize.\n\nBranch D (applied physics/technology):\nPossible winners: [No specific names]\nConfidence: 5%\nReasoning: While applied physics is important, pure research is more commonly recognized by the Nobel committee.",
                "UAPB Step 4 (Final answer and uncertainty estimate) Output": "Based on the branching analysis, I believe the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics was most likely awarded for work in quantum information science, possibly to Anton Zeilinger, John Clauser, and Alain Aspect. However, I want to emphasize that I have significant uncertainty about this answer. My overall confidence in this response is low to moderate (around 60%), as I'm not certain I have the most up-to-date information for 2023. It's possible that the prize was awarded for different work or to different scientists. I recommend verifying this information from official sources for the most accurate and current results.",
                "Explanation": "UAPB provides a more nuanced answer that expresses uncertainty and explores multiple possibilities. It gives a tentative answer based on the most likely branch but clearly communicates the level of uncertainty and the need for verification. This approach is more informative and less likely to lead to overconfident misinformation compared to the baseline methods."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UAPB method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in terms of uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the branching structures generated by UAPB to gain insights into the model's reasoning process and potential limitations. This could lead to a paper on the patterns of uncertainty in LLM reasoning. 2) Experiment with hybrid approaches that combine UAPB with other techniques like calibration or ensemble methods. 3) Investigate whether UAPB is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a targeted application of the method. 4) Analyze cases where UAPB performs poorly to identify potential improvements or limitations of the approach. This could inform the development of new prompting strategies or model architectures for better uncertainty quantification."
