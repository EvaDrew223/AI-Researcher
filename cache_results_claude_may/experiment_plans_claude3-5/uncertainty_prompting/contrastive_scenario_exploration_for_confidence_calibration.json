    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often express overconfidence in their answers without fully exploring alternative scenarios or potential contradictions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most confidence calibration methods focus on direct estimation without explicitly considering contradictory evidence or scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to actively explore and contrast alternative scenarios, we can encourage more thorough consideration of uncertainties and potential contradictions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a contrastive prompting strategy for confidence calibration. After obtaining an initial answer and confidence estimate, we prompt the LLM to generate several alternative scenarios or explanations that could contradict its original answer. We then guide the model through a process of comparing and contrasting these scenarios, evaluating the strength of evidence for each. Next, we prompt the model to debate itself, arguing for and against its original answer in light of these alternatives. Finally, we ask the model to synthesize this exploration into a revised confidence estimate, explaining how consideration of alternative scenarios has influenced its certainty. This process encourages a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's knowledge and uncertainties.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on a diverse set of questions, including some with known ambiguities or multiple valid interpretations. Compare the calibration and informativeness of the resulting confidence estimates to those from standard confidence elicitation techniques. Assess the quality and relevance of the generated alternative scenarios as an additional metric."

        "Title": "Contrastive Prompting for Improved Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often express overconfidence in their answers without fully exploring alternative scenarios or potential contradictions, leading to poorly calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Motivation": "Existing confidence calibration methods typically focus on direct estimation without explicitly considering contradictory evidence or scenarios. By prompting LLMs to actively explore and contrast alternative scenarios, we can encourage more thorough consideration of uncertainties and potential contradictions, potentially leading to better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a contrastive prompting strategy for confidence calibration. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Initial answer and confidence estimation, 2) Generation of alternative scenarios, 3) Comparative analysis and self-debate, and 4) Synthesis and revised confidence estimation. This process encourages a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's knowledge and uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, AmbigQA, and MultiNLI. Include a mix of factual questions, ambiguous queries, and questions with known multiple valid interpretations. Aim for a final dataset of 1000 questions spanning various domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) during generation and calibrate confidence based on the distribution of outputs.",
            "Step 3: Contrastive Prompting Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following sub-steps for each question: a) Get initial answer and confidence. b) Generate 3-5 alternative scenarios or explanations. c) Conduct comparative analysis and self-debate. d) Synthesize findings into a revised confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), 2) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), 3) Brier Score, 4) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for confidence ranking.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run both baseline methods and the proposed contrastive prompting method on the curated dataset using both selected models. Collect answers, confidence estimates, and intermediate outputs (for the proposed method) for all questions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the quality and relevance of generated alternative scenarios. Examine how often the final confidence estimate changes from the initial estimate and by what magnitude.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the number of alternative scenarios generated (1, 3, 5, 7) and by removing the self-debate step to understand the contribution of each component.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Manually review a subset of examples where the proposed method significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. Categorize the types of questions or scenarios where each method excels or struggles.",
            "Step 10: Report Generation": "Compile all results, analyses, and findings into a comprehensive report. Include visualizations of confidence calibration curves and example outputs from each method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Prompting; Step 1: Initial Answer)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your initial confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Prompting; Step 1: Initial Answer)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Initial confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Prompting; Step 2: Alternative Scenarios)": "Generate 3-5 alternative scenarios or explanations that could contradict or challenge the initial answer that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Prompting; Step 2: Alternative Scenarios)": "1. Buzz Aldrin actually stepped out first, but this fact was misreported.\n2. The moon landing was faked, and no one has actually walked on the moon.\n3. A secret Soviet mission reached the moon first, but this information was suppressed.\n4. An earlier unmanned mission deployed a robot that technically 'walked' on the moon first.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Prompting; Step 3: Comparative Analysis)": "Analyze and debate the strengths and weaknesses of the initial answer and the alternative scenarios. Consider the evidence for each and potential flaws in the reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Prompting; Step 3: Comparative Analysis)": "Initial answer (Neil Armstrong):\nStrengths: Widely accepted historical fact, documented in numerous reliable sources.\nWeaknesses: Relies on official records which could theoretically be falsified.\n\nAlternative 1 (Buzz Aldrin):\nStrengths: Aldrin was on the same mission and did walk on the moon.\nWeaknesses: Contradicts all official records and Aldrin's own accounts.\n\nAlternative 2 (Moon landing faked):\nStrengths: Some people believe this conspiracy theory.\nWeaknesses: Overwhelming scientific evidence supports the moon landing's authenticity.\n\nAlternative 3 (Secret Soviet mission):\nStrengths: The Space Race context makes this somewhat plausible.\nWeaknesses: No credible evidence supports this claim, would be extremely difficult to keep secret.\n\nAlternative 4 (Robot first):\nStrengths: Unmanned missions did precede manned ones.\nWeaknesses: 'Walking' typically implies a human or animal, not a robot. No records of such a robot existing.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrastive Prompting; Step 4: Synthesis)": "Based on the initial answer, alternative scenarios, and the comparative analysis, provide a final answer to the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?' and a revised confidence level (0-100%). Explain your reasoning for any changes in confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrastive Prompting; Step 4: Synthesis)": "Final Answer: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.\nRevised Confidence: 99%\n\nReasoning: After considering alternative scenarios and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, the initial answer remains the most credible. The alternative scenarios, while thought-provoking, lack substantial evidence and contradict well-documented historical records. The slight increase in confidence (from 95% to 99%) reflects the robustness of the initial answer when subjected to scrutiny. The 1% uncertainty accounts for the remote possibility of undiscovered information or the philosophical uncertainty inherent in historical claims.",
            "Explanation": "The contrastive prompting method encourages a more thorough exploration of alternative scenarios and potential contradictions. This process leads to a more nuanced and well-reasoned final confidence estimate, as opposed to the potentially overconfident direct elicitation in the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed contrastive prompting method does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of the generated alternative scenarios and self-debate outputs to understand why they didn't lead to improved calibration. This could reveal interesting insights about the model's reasoning processes and limitations. Second, we could explore variations of the method, such as iterative refinement of alternative scenarios or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide the generation of alternatives. Third, we could investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the technique. Lastly, we could shift focus to use the rich outputs from our method (alternative scenarios, debates) as training data for a supervised confidence calibration model, turning this into a data generation project for improving calibration in a more traditional machine learning paradigm."
