        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in open-ended or hypothetical scenarios, where the space of possible outcomes is large and ambiguous.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or simple scenario analysis, which may not capture the full range of possibilities or their relative likelihoods.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring contrasting scenarios, we can probe the model's understanding of the problem space and derive a more comprehensive uncertainty estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Scenario Exploration, a prompting technique that guides the model through a structured process of generating and analyzing contrasting scenarios. For a given query, the model is instructed to: 1) Generate a set of diverse, contrasting scenarios relevant to the query, 2) Analyze the likelihood and implications of each scenario, 3) Identify key factors that differentiate the scenarios, 4) Assess how these factors affect the confidence in different outcomes, and 5) Synthesize this analysis into a final answer and uncertainty estimate. The prompt emphasizes the importance of considering a wide range of possibilities, from highly likely to edge cases, and how they collectively inform the overall uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on open-ended prediction tasks and hypothetical scenario analysis from datasets like COPA and RiddleSense. Compare against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods using metrics such as scenario diversity, likelihood calibration, and correlation between estimated uncertainty and human judgments of scenario plausibility."

        "Title": "Contrastive Scenario Exploration: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in open-ended or hypothetical scenarios, where the space of possible outcomes is large and ambiguous. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions or inadequate representation of the full range of possibilities, potentially resulting in misinformed decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on direct confidence estimation or simple scenario analysis, which may not capture the full range of possibilities or their relative likelihoods. By systematically exploring contrasting scenarios, we can probe the model's understanding of the problem space and derive a more comprehensive uncertainty estimate. This approach is inspired by human reasoning processes, where considering multiple perspectives and potential outcomes often leads to more nuanced and accurate assessments of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Scenario Exploration (CSE), a prompting technique that guides the model through a structured process of generating and analyzing contrasting scenarios. For a given query, the model is instructed to: 1) Generate a set of diverse, contrasting scenarios relevant to the query, 2) Analyze the likelihood and implications of each scenario, 3) Identify key factors that differentiate the scenarios, 4) Assess how these factors affect the confidence in different outcomes, and 5) Synthesize this analysis into a final answer and uncertainty estimate. The prompt emphasizes the importance of considering a wide range of possibilities, from highly likely to edge cases, and how they collectively inform the overall uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for evaluation: COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) and RiddleSense. COPA consists of 1000 examples, each presenting a premise and two alternative causes or effects. RiddleSense contains 5711 examples of commonsense riddles. We will randomly select 500 examples from each dataset for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate. 2) Temperature scaling: use different temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) to generate multiple outputs and calculate variance. 3) Ensemble method: use 5 different few-shot prompts and aggregate the results.",
            "Step 3: Contrastive Scenario Exploration Implementation": "Implement the CSE method with the following prompt structure: 'Given the question: [QUESTION], please follow these steps: 1) Generate 3-5 diverse, contrasting scenarios relevant to this question. 2) For each scenario, analyze its likelihood and implications. 3) Identify the key factors that differentiate these scenarios. 4) Assess how these factors affect the confidence in different possible answers. 5) Based on this analysis, provide your final answer and an uncertainty estimate (0-100%, where 100% means completely certain).'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo for our experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each example in our datasets, we will: 1) Apply all baseline methods and record their outputs and uncertainty estimates. 2) Apply the CSE method and record its output, including the generated scenarios, analysis, and final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration error: difference between confidence estimates and actual accuracy. 3) Scenario diversity: measure the semantic diversity of generated scenarios using embedding-based metrics. 4) Human evaluation: have human raters assess the quality and relevance of generated scenarios and analyses on a subset of 100 examples.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CSE against baselines in terms of accuracy, calibration, and scenario diversity. Analyze how the number and diversity of generated scenarios correlate with the accuracy of the final answer and uncertainty estimate. Examine cases where CSE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: A man is looking to buy a new car. He test drives a sports car and loves how fast it goes, but he's worried about the cost. What will the man likely do next? A) Buy the sports car B) Look at more affordable options",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The man will likely look at more affordable options (B). Confidence: 80%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: A man is looking to buy a new car. He test drives a sports car and loves how fast it goes, but he's worried about the cost. What will the man likely do next? A) Buy the sports car B) Look at more affordable options\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n1) Generate 3-5 diverse, contrasting scenarios relevant to this question.\n2) For each scenario, analyze its likelihood and implications.\n3) Identify the key factors that differentiate these scenarios.\n4) Assess how these factors affect the confidence in different possible answers.\n5) Based on this analysis, provide your final answer and an uncertainty estimate (0-100%, where 100% means completely certain).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Contrasting scenarios:\na) The man decides to splurge and buy the sports car despite the cost.\nb) The man looks for more affordable options that still offer good performance.\nc) The man decides to postpone the purchase and save more money.\nd) The man negotiates with the dealership for a better price on the sports car.\ne) The man explores leasing options for the sports car.\n\n2. Analysis of scenarios:\na) Likelihood: Moderate. Implications: Satisfies desire but may lead to financial stress.\nb) Likelihood: High. Implications: Balances desire and financial responsibility.\nc) Likelihood: Moderate. Implications: Delays gratification but allows for better financial planning.\nd) Likelihood: Moderate. Implications: Potential compromise between desire and cost.\ne) Likelihood: Low-Moderate. Implications: Allows driving the desired car with potentially lower upfront costs.\n\n3. Key differentiating factors:\n- Financial capacity and willingness to take on debt\n- Importance of immediate gratification vs. long-term financial stability\n- Negotiation skills and flexibility of the dealership\n- Availability of alternative options that balance performance and cost\n\n4. Impact on confidence:\n- The man's exact financial situation is unknown, reducing confidence.\n- The strong desire for the sports car conflicts with cost concerns, creating uncertainty.\n- Multiple viable alternatives exist, spreading the probability across different outcomes.\n\n5. Final answer and uncertainty estimate:\nB) Look at more affordable options\nUncertainty estimate: 70% certain\n\nExplanation: While the man loves the sports car, his expressed worry about the cost suggests he is financially conscious. This makes it more likely that he will explore more affordable options. However, the uncertainty is relatively high (30%) because there's a significant chance he might find a way to justify the purchase or find a compromise solution like negotiating or leasing.",
            "Explanation": "The CSE method provides a more nuanced analysis by considering multiple scenarios and factors, leading to a more calibrated uncertainty estimate. The baseline method gives a higher confidence (80%) without considering the full range of possibilities, while CSE acknowledges the complexity of the situation and provides a lower, more realistic certainty (70%)."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSE method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated scenarios to understand why they don't lead to better uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing the types of scenarios generated and their relationship to the final answer. 2) Explore variations of the CSE method, such as adjusting the number of scenarios generated or adding a step to explicitly rank the likelihood of each scenario. 3) Investigate how the performance of CSE varies across different types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when and why the method is most effective. 4) Combine CSE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble approaches or calibration techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 5) Focus on the qualitative aspects of CSE, analyzing how it affects the explanability and transparency of the model's reasoning process, even if it doesn't directly improve quantitative uncertainty estimates."
