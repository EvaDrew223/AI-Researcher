        "Problem": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often fail to capture subtle semantic nuances and contextual ambiguities that humans naturally detect.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on statistical measures of output variation or direct confidence scoring, which may miss important semantic aspects of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, we propose probing the model's uncertainty by introducing semantically related concepts and measuring how they 'resonate' with the original query.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Resonance Uncertainty Probing (SRUP), a novel prompting technique that measures uncertainty by analyzing the model's response to semantically related probes. The method involves: 1) Semantic expansion: Prompt the LLM to generate a set of concepts semantically related to the original query at varying degrees of similarity. 2) Resonance probing: For each related concept, construct a probe that incorporates it into the original query context. Prompt the model to answer these probes. 3) Resonance analysis: Measure the 'semantic resonance' by analyzing how the model's responses change across the spectrum of related concepts. 4) Uncertainty quantification: Derive uncertainty metrics based on the patterns of semantic resonance, such as response stability, semantic drift, and resonance peaks/troughs.",

        "Title": "Semantic Resonance Uncertainty Probing: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Contextual Concept Exploration",
        "Problem Statement": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture subtle semantic nuances and contextual ambiguities that humans naturally detect. This limitation hinders the reliable assessment of model confidence in various natural language processing tasks, potentially leading to misinterpretation of model outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on statistical measures of output variation or direct confidence scoring, which may miss important semantic aspects of uncertainty. Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, we propose probing the model's uncertainty by introducing semantically related concepts and measuring how they 'resonate' with the original query. This approach aims to leverage the LLM's inherent understanding of semantic relationships to provide a more nuanced and context-aware measure of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Resonance Uncertainty Probing (SRUP), a novel prompting technique that measures uncertainty by analyzing the model's response to semantically related probes. The method involves four main steps: 1) Semantic expansion: Prompt the LLM to generate a set of concepts semantically related to the original query at varying degrees of similarity. 2) Resonance probing: For each related concept, construct a probe that incorporates it into the original query context. Prompt the model to answer these probes. 3) Resonance analysis: Measure the 'semantic resonance' by analyzing how the model's responses change across the spectrum of related concepts. 4) Uncertainty quantification: Derive uncertainty metrics based on the patterns of semantic resonance, such as response stability, semantic drift, and resonance peaks/troughs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets that require fine-grained semantic understanding: WinoGrande and HellaSwag. These datasets are chosen for their emphasis on commonsense reasoning and contextual understanding, which aligns well with our goal of capturing subtle semantic uncertainties.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Monte Carlo Dropout: Run multiple forward passes with dropout enabled and compute the variance of the outputs. 2) Softmax Response: Use the softmax probabilities of the model's output as a measure of confidence. These baselines will serve as comparison points for our SRUP method.",
            "Step 3: SRUP Implementation": "Implement the four steps of SRUP: a) Semantic expansion: Prompt the LLM with 'Generate 5 concepts related to [original query], ranging from closely related to distantly related.' b) Resonance probing: For each related concept, create a probe by incorporating it into the original query context. c) Resonance analysis: Compute similarity scores between the original response and the responses to each probe using cosine similarity of sentence embeddings. d) Uncertainty quantification: Calculate metrics such as the standard deviation of similarity scores, the slope of the similarity curve, and the presence of local maxima/minima in the similarity curve.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models are chosen for their strong performance on a wide range of NLP tasks and their ability to follow complex instructions.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each example in the datasets: a) Generate responses and uncertainty estimates using the baseline methods. b) Apply SRUP to generate uncertainty estimates. c) Record all responses, intermediate steps, and final uncertainty scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare the performance of SRUP against the baseline methods using the following metrics: a) Correlation with human judgments of uncertainty (we will use a small subset of examples with human-annotated uncertainty scores). b) Ability to predict model errors (use uncertainty scores to predict whether the model's answer is correct). c) Qualitative analysis of cases where SRUP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, focusing on: a) The types of semantic nuances and ambiguities that SRUP captures better than baselines. b) The relationship between semantic resonance patterns and model uncertainty. c) The impact of the choice of related concepts on the final uncertainty estimates."

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SRUP Step 4: Uncertainty Quantification)": "Uncertainty score: 0.2 (based on standard deviation of similarity scores and slope of similarity curve)",
            "explanation": "SRUP provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by exploring the semantic space around the query. It captures the model's consistency across related concepts, potentially revealing subtle ambiguities that statistical methods might miss."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SRUP does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the generated related concepts to ensure they are sufficiently diverse and relevant, and analyzing cases where SRUP fails to capture uncertainty accurately. We could also explore variations of the method, such as using different similarity metrics or alternative ways of generating related concepts. Additionally, we might investigate whether SRUP provides complementary information to traditional uncertainty estimation methods, potentially leading to a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of multiple techniques. If these approaches do not yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of how LLMs respond to semantic variations in input, which could provide valuable insights into model behavior and limitations even if it doesn't directly improve uncertainty estimation."
