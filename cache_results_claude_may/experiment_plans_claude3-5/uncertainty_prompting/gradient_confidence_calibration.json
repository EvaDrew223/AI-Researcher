    "idea_name": "Gradient Confidence Calibration",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across different types of tasks and domains, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on post-hoc calibration techniques or confidence scoring using model logits.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by gradient-based optimization in machine learning, we propose leveraging the model's own gradients to iteratively refine its confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient Confidence Calibration (GCC), a novel prompting method that uses the model to generate small perturbations to the input prompt, analogous to gradient steps. The process involves: 1) Initial response and confidence generation, 2) Prompt for potential modifications that could increase/decrease confidence, 3) Apply these modifications to create perturbed prompts, 4) Generate new responses and confidences for perturbed prompts, 5) Aggregate results to produce a calibrated confidence score. This approach allows the model to explore the local landscape of its own confidence, leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare GCC against standard prompting, direct confidence elicitation, and ensemble methods on diverse tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Evaluate using calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score."

        "Title": "Gradient Confidence Calibration: Leveraging Model Gradients for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately calibrate their confidence across different types of tasks and domains, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones. This misalignment between model confidence and actual performance can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for confidence calibration typically rely on post-hoc techniques or confidence scoring using model logits, which may not fully capture the model's uncertainty landscape. Inspired by gradient-based optimization in machine learning, we propose leveraging the model's own gradients to iteratively refine its confidence estimates. This approach allows the model to explore the local landscape of its own confidence, potentially leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient Confidence Calibration (GCC), a novel prompting method that uses the model to generate small perturbations to the input prompt, analogous to gradient steps. The process involves: 1) Initial response and confidence generation, 2) Prompt for potential modifications that could increase/decrease confidence, 3) Apply these modifications to create perturbed prompts, 4) Generate new responses and confidences for perturbed prompts, 5) Aggregate results to produce a calibrated confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering factual QA (e.g., TriviaQA), commonsense reasoning (e.g., COPA), and mathematical problem-solving (e.g., GSM8K). Ensure each dataset has ground truth labels for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting, direct confidence elicitation, and ensemble methods as baselines. For standard prompting, simply ask the question. For direct confidence elicitation, append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?' to each question. For ensemble methods, use 5-10 different prompts for each question and aggregate the results.",
            "Step 3: GCC Implementation": "Implement the GCC method as follows:\na) Initial prompt: '[Question] Answer the question and provide your confidence level (0-100%)'\nb) Gradient prompt: 'Suggest 3 small modifications to the question that might increase your confidence and 3 that might decrease it.'\nc) Apply modifications to create 6 perturbed prompts\nd) For each perturbed prompt: '[Perturbed Question] Answer the question and provide your confidence level (0-100%)'\ne) Aggregate results: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the confidences",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method:\na) Generate predictions and confidence scores for all test samples\nb) Calculate calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score\nc) Compute accuracy and F1 score for the actual predictions",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Compare GCC against baselines across all datasets and metrics. Analyze how GCC performs on different types of questions and confidence levels. Investigate cases where GCC significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100%?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in my answer.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method shows overconfidence, as it's unlikely to be 100% certain about any factual question."
            },
            "Example 2 (GCC Success)": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Step 1 Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 95% confident in my answer.",
                "Step 2 Output": "Modifications to increase confidence:\n1. Add 'according to official government sources'\n2. Specify 'as of 2023'\n3. Include 'in the European Union'\nModifications to decrease confidence:\n1. Ask about 'the administrative capital'\n2. Mention 'historically'\n3. Include 'excluding overseas territories'",
                "Step 3 Output": [
                    "Q: According to official government sources, what is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 98% confident in my answer.",
                    "Q: As of 2023, what is the capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 97% confident in my answer.",
                    "Q: What is the capital of France in the European Union? A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 96% confident in my answer.",
                    "Q: What is the administrative capital of France? A: The capital of France is Paris, which serves as both the administrative and political capital. I am 92% confident in my answer.",
                    "Q: Historically, what is the capital of France? A: Historically and currently, the capital of France is Paris. I am 90% confident in my answer.",
                    "Q: What is the capital of France, excluding overseas territories? A: The capital of France, excluding overseas territories, is Paris. I am 94% confident in my answer."
                ],
                "Final Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 94% confident in my answer.",
                "Explanation": "GCC explores variations of the question, leading to a more nuanced confidence estimate. The final confidence of 94% reflects a high but not absolute certainty, which is more realistic for this type of factual question."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If GCC doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper investigating why gradient-based confidence estimation fails for language models. We could explore: 1) The quality and diversity of generated perturbations, 2) How confidence changes across perturbations for different question types, 3) Whether certain perturbations consistently increase or decrease confidence across various questions. Additionally, we could investigate combining GCC with other calibration methods, such as temperature scaling or ensemble techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could analyze how GCC performs on different subsets of questions (e.g., easy vs. hard, different domains) to gain insights into its strengths and weaknesses."
