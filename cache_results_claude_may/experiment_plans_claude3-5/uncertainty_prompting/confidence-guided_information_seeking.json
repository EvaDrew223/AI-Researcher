        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess when they need additional information to answer a question confidently, leading to overconfident incorrect answers or unnecessary information retrieval.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use fixed thresholds or separate classifiers to decide when to seek additional information.",
        "Motivation": "Humans naturally gauge their confidence during reasoning and seek specific information to resolve uncertainties. Enabling LLMs to do the same could lead to more efficient and accurate question-answering systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence-Guided Information Seeking (CGIS), a dynamic prompting strategy that interleaves confidence estimation with targeted information retrieval. The process involves: 1) Initial response generation with a confidence estimate. 2) If confidence is low, the model is prompted to identify specific knowledge gaps and formulate targeted queries. 3) Relevant information is retrieved (simulated in our experiments) and provided to the model. 4) The model updates its answer and confidence estimate. 5) This process repeats until a confidence threshold is reached or a maximum number of iterations is performed. CGIS prompts are designed to encourage metacognitive reflection on the model's current knowledge state and the potential impact of additional information.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CGIS against static retrieval-augmented methods and fixed-threshold information seeking approaches on open-domain QA tasks. Measure performance improvements, reduction in unnecessary retrievals, and calibration of final confidence estimates."

        "Title": "Confidence-Guided Information Seeking: Improving LLM Uncertainty Estimation and Information Retrieval",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess when they need additional information to answer a question confidently, leading to overconfident incorrect answers or unnecessary information retrieval. This problem hinders the development of efficient and accurate question-answering systems.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically use fixed thresholds or separate classifiers to decide when to seek additional information. However, these methods lack the flexibility and nuance of human-like reasoning. Humans naturally gauge their confidence during reasoning and seek specific information to resolve uncertainties. Enabling LLMs to do the same could lead to more efficient and accurate question-answering systems. Our proposed method, Confidence-Guided Information Seeking (CGIS), aims to mimic this human-like approach by interleaving confidence estimation with targeted information retrieval.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence-Guided Information Seeking (CGIS), a dynamic prompting strategy that interleaves confidence estimation with targeted information retrieval.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TriviaQA dataset for our experiments. This dataset contains a large number of question-answer pairs across various domains, making it suitable for evaluating open-domain QA tasks.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baselines: 1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the question to the model. 2) Static retrieval-augmented method: Retrieve a fixed number of relevant passages for each question and include them in the prompt.",
            "Step 4: CGIS Implementation": "Implement the CGIS method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation with confidence estimation. b) Knowledge gap identification and query formulation. c) Information retrieval simulation. d) Answer updating with new confidence estimation. e) Iteration until confidence threshold or max iterations reached.",
            "Step 5: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of CGIS. For example: a) Initial response: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' b) Knowledge gap identification: 'What specific information would help you answer the question more confidently?' c) Answer updating: 'Given this new information: [NEW_INFO], update your answer to the original question: [QUESTION]'",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. 2) Average number of retrieval steps. 3) Confidence calibration: Compare estimated confidence with actual accuracy. 4) Retrieval efficiency: Measure the relevance of retrieved information.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments with both baseline methods and CGIS on the TriviaQA dataset. Use a subset of 1000 questions for initial experiments and scale up if computational resources allow.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare CGIS against baselines in terms of accuracy, number of retrieval steps, confidence calibration, and retrieval efficiency. Analyze how CGIS performance changes with different confidence thresholds and maximum iteration limits."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?",
                "Output (Direct Prompting)": "The first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He and his team arrived at the South Pole on December 14, 1911, beating the British expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott by about a month.",
                "Output (Static Retrieval-Augmented)": "[Retrieved passage: Roald Amundsen led the Antarctic expedition (1910\u201312) that was the first to reach the South Pole, on December 14, 1911. Robert Falcon Scott, a British explorer, reached the South Pole on January 17, 1912, only to find that Amundsen had preceded him by 33 days.]\n\nThe first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He and his team arrived at the South Pole on December 14, 1911, beating the British expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott by 33 days."
            },
            "CGIS Example": {
                "Input": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?",
                "Step 1 (Initial Response)": "The first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. Confidence: 80%",
                "Step 2 (Knowledge Gap)": "To increase my confidence, I would need to verify the exact date Amundsen reached the South Pole and confirm if there were any earlier expeditions that might have reached it first.",
                "Step 3 (Retrieval)": "[Simulated retrieval: Roald Amundsen led the Antarctic expedition (1910\u201312) that was the first to reach the South Pole, on December 14, 1911.]",
                "Step 4 (Updated Response)": "The first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He and his team arrived at the South Pole on December 14, 1911. Confidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "CGIS allows the model to identify its knowledge gaps and seek specific information, leading to a more confident and precise answer compared to the baselines."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CGIS does not show significant improvements over the baselines, we can analyze the following aspects: 1) Examine the quality of generated knowledge gaps and queries. If they are not specific or relevant enough, we can experiment with different prompting strategies to improve this step. 2) Analyze the confidence estimation accuracy. If the model's confidence estimates are not well-calibrated, we can explore techniques to improve confidence calibration, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods. 3) Investigate the impact of the simulated retrieval step. If the retrieved information is not sufficiently helpful, we can explore more sophisticated retrieval methods or fine-tune the retrieval process. 4) Consider turning the project into an analysis paper, focusing on why LLMs struggle with uncertainty estimation and information seeking. This could involve detailed error analysis, ablation studies on different components of CGIS, and exploration of how performance varies across different types of questions or domains."
