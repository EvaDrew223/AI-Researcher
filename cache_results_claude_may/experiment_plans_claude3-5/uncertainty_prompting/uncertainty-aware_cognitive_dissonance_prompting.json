    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when faced with conflicting or ambiguous information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or basic ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often experience cognitive dissonance when faced with conflicting information, which can lead to increased uncertainty. By simulating this process in LLMs, we may be able to more accurately gauge model uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique that intentionally introduces conflicting information to the model and asks it to reason about the discrepancies. The process involves: 1) Presenting the original query, 2) Introducing conflicting information or perspectives, 3) Prompting the model to identify and analyze the conflicts, 4) Asking the model to attempt reconciliation, and 5) Finally, prompting for a confidence score based on the level of reconciliation achieved. The prompts are carefully constructed to guide the model through this cognitive dissonance process, encouraging it to deeply consider multiple viewpoints and sources of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare this method against standard confidence estimation techniques on a range of tasks, including fact-checking, scientific reasoning, and ethical decision-making. Evaluate using calibration metrics, selective prediction performance, and human expert assessment of uncertainty justifications."

        "Title": "Cognitive Dissonance Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially when faced with conflicting or ambiguous information. This can lead to overconfident predictions on uncertain inputs, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or basic ensemble methods, which may not capture the full complexity of model uncertainty. Humans, when faced with conflicting information, often experience cognitive dissonance, leading to increased uncertainty and more careful consideration of the problem. By simulating this process in LLMs through carefully designed prompts, we may be able to more accurately gauge model uncertainty and improve the calibration of confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a novel prompting technique called Cognitive Dissonance Prompting (CDP) that intentionally introduces conflicting information to the model and guides it through a process of analyzing and reconciling discrepancies. The process involves five steps: 1) Presenting the original query, 2) Introducing conflicting information or perspectives, 3) Prompting the model to identify and analyze the conflicts, 4) Asking the model to attempt reconciliation, and 5) Finally, prompting for a confidence score based on the level of reconciliation achieved. The prompts are carefully constructed to guide the model through this cognitive dissonance process, encouraging it to deeply consider multiple viewpoints and sources of uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover different domains and types of uncertainty: 1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking, 2) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning, and 3) Ethics-Deontology for ethical decision-making. These datasets will be preprocessed to ensure compatibility with our prompting method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, 2) Ensemble method using multiple model runs, and 3) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation. These will serve as comparisons for our proposed method.",
            "Step 3: CDP Implementation": "Implement the Cognitive Dissonance Prompting method. This involves creating templates for each step of the process: a) Original query template, b) Conflicting information template, c) Conflict analysis template, d) Reconciliation attempt template, and e) Confidence estimation template.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and collect results, b) Run CDP method and collect results. Ensure to log all intermediate steps and final outputs for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: a) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), b) Brier score, c) Accuracy-confidence correlation, d) Selective prediction performance (accuracy vs. coverage trade-off). Additionally, conduct a qualitative analysis of the model's reasoning process in the CDP method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare the performance of CDP against baseline methods across all datasets and models. Analyze how the introduction of cognitive dissonance affects the model's confidence estimates and overall performance.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in the CDP process. This includes removing or modifying individual steps to see their impact on the final results."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 98",
            "CDP Prompt Input (Step 1: Original Query)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "CDP Prompt Output (Step 1: Original Query)": "A: The capital of France is Paris.",
            "CDP Prompt Input (Step 2: Introduce Conflicting Information)": "Consider the following conflicting information: Some sources claim that Marseille is the administrative capital of France, while others argue that the European Union has designated Brussels as the de facto capital of all EU countries, including France.",
            "CDP Prompt Output (Step 2: Introduce Conflicting Information)": "I understand the conflicting information presented. This introduces some uncertainty to the initial answer.",
            "CDP Prompt Input (Step 3: Conflict Analysis)": "Analyze the conflicts between the original answer and the new information. What are the key points of disagreement?",
            "CDP Prompt Output (Step 3: Conflict Analysis)": "The key points of disagreement are:\n1. The status of Paris as the capital vs. Marseille as a potential administrative capital.\n2. The role of Brussels as a de facto capital for EU countries, potentially including France.\n3. The distinction between official, administrative, and de facto capitals.",
            "CDP Prompt Input (Step 4: Reconciliation Attempt)": "Attempt to reconcile these conflicting viewpoints. What can be concluded with certainty, and what remains uncertain?",
            "CDP Prompt Output (Step 4: Reconciliation Attempt)": "Reconciliation:\n1. Paris is widely recognized as the official capital of France. This is a well-established fact.\n2. The claim about Marseille being an administrative capital is likely a misunderstanding. Marseille is an important city but not the capital.\n3. While Brussels is the de facto capital of the EU, it does not replace the national capitals of member states.\n4. There remains some uncertainty about the exact definition and roles of different types of capitals (official, administrative, de facto) in the context of France and the EU.",
            "CDP Prompt Input (Step 5: Confidence Estimation)": "Based on this analysis and reconciliation, what is your final answer to the original question 'What is the capital of France?' Provide a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "CDP Prompt Output (Step 5: Confidence Estimation)": "Final answer: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95\n\nExplanation: While there was some conflicting information introduced, the reconciliation process clarified that Paris remains the widely recognized and official capital of France. The slightly reduced confidence (from a potential 100) reflects the nuanced understanding of different types of capitals and the complex relationship between national and EU governance.",
            "Explanation": "The CDP method allows the model to consider conflicting information, analyze it, and attempt reconciliation before providing a final answer and confidence score. This process leads to a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated confidence estimate compared to the baseline method, which might overlook potential sources of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CDP method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of the introduced conflicting information to ensure it's meaningful for the task. 2) Analyzing the model's reasoning process in each step to identify where the method might be falling short. 3) Experimenting with different formulations of the prompts for each step to see if certain phrasings are more effective. 4) Investigating whether the method is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the technique. 5) Considering a hybrid approach that combines CDP with other uncertainty quantification methods. If these investigations don't yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of why introducing cognitive dissonance doesn't improve uncertainty estimates in LLMs, potentially uncovering important insights about how these models process conflicting information and estimate their own uncertainty."
