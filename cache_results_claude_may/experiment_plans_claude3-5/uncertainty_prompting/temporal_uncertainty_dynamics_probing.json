        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often treat uncertainty as a static property, failing to capture how it evolves over time or with changing context.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide point-in-time uncertainty estimates without considering temporal dynamics or evolving knowledge states.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of dynamic systems in physics, we propose that uncertainty in LLMs should be viewed as a time-dependent phenomenon that evolves based on changing information and context.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics Probing (TUDP), a novel prompting technique that tracks the evolution of uncertainty over a simulated timeline. The process involves: 1) Temporal Scenario Generation: Create a sequence of time-stamped prompts that simulate the gradual revelation of information about a topic or event. 2) Incremental Prompting: At each time step, prompt the LLM with the cumulative information up to that point, asking for both an answer and a confidence score. 3) Uncertainty Trajectory Mapping: Track how the LLM's answers and confidence scores change over the simulated timeline. 4) Temporal Uncertainty Metrics: Introduce novel metrics such as 'Uncertainty Velocity' (rate of change in confidence) and 'Uncertainty Acceleration' (change in the rate of change) to capture dynamic aspects of uncertainty. 5) Counterfactual Temporal Probing: Introduce hypothetical future scenarios to probe how the model's uncertainty projections change based on potential future information.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TUDP on tasks that inherently involve evolving information, such as news event analysis, scientific discovery timelines, and dynamic decision-making scenarios. We'll compare it against static uncertainty quantification methods using both standard metrics (calibration error, Brier score) and our novel temporal uncertainty metrics. We'll also conduct a series of case studies to analyze how different types of information impact uncertainty trajectories across various domains."

        "Title": "Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics Probing: Capturing the Evolution of Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often treat uncertainty as a static property, failing to capture how it evolves over time or with changing context. This approach limits our understanding of how LLMs' confidence changes as new information is presented, potentially leading to misinterpretation of model outputs in dynamic scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide point-in-time uncertainty estimates without considering temporal dynamics or evolving knowledge states. This static view fails to capture the nuanced ways in which LLMs process and integrate new information. Inspired by the concept of dynamic systems in physics, we propose that uncertainty in LLMs should be viewed as a time-dependent phenomenon that evolves based on changing information and context. By treating uncertainty as a dynamic property, we can gain deeper insights into how LLMs reason and update their beliefs, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable AI systems.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Uncertainty Dynamics Probing (TUDP), a novel prompting technique that tracks the evolution of uncertainty over a simulated timeline. The process involves five key steps: 1) Temporal Scenario Generation: Create a sequence of time-stamped prompts that simulate the gradual revelation of information about a topic or event. 2) Incremental Prompting: At each time step, prompt the LLM with the cumulative information up to that point, asking for both an answer and a confidence score. 3) Uncertainty Trajectory Mapping: Track how the LLM's answers and confidence scores change over the simulated timeline. 4) Temporal Uncertainty Metrics: Introduce novel metrics such as 'Uncertainty Velocity' (rate of change in confidence) and 'Uncertainty Acceleration' (change in the rate of change) to capture dynamic aspects of uncertainty. 5) Counterfactual Temporal Probing: Introduce hypothetical future scenarios to probe how the model's uncertainty projections change based on potential future information.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of temporal scenarios across various domains (e.g., news events, scientific discoveries, historical timelines). Each scenario should have a sequence of time-stamped information reveals, with a ground truth answer that may change over time. Use existing datasets like TimeQA or Temporal-ATOMIC as starting points, and augment them with manually curated scenarios if needed.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement static uncertainty quantification methods as baselines. These should include: a) Direct prompting with confidence estimation, b) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models), c) Ensemble methods (using different API calls or model versions).",
            "Step 3: TUDP Implementation": "Implement the TUDP method: a) Create prompts for each time step in the scenarios, b) Develop a function to calculate confidence scores from model outputs (e.g., using softmax probabilities or calibrated confidence estimation), c) Implement functions to calculate Uncertainty Velocity and Uncertainty Acceleration.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Choose a set of LLMs to evaluate. Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic and open-source models like LLaMA-2.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each scenario in the dataset: a) Run baseline methods to get static uncertainty estimates, b) Run TUDP method, prompting the model at each time step and recording answers and confidence scores, c) Calculate Uncertainty Velocity and Acceleration for the TUDP results.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare TUDP against baselines using: a) Traditional metrics: calibration error, Brier score, b) Novel temporal metrics: average Uncertainty Velocity, maximum Uncertainty Acceleration, c) Qualitative analysis: manually review a subset of trajectories to identify patterns and insights.",
            "Step 7: Counterfactual Analysis": "For a subset of scenarios: a) Introduce hypothetical future information at different time points, b) Re-run TUDP with these counterfactuals, c) Analyze how different types of hypothetical information impact uncertainty trajectories.",
            "Step 8: Results Analysis": "Aggregate results across all scenarios and models. Identify patterns in how uncertainty evolves for different types of questions or domains. Analyze the relationship between Uncertainty Velocity/Acceleration and final answer correctness.",
            "Step 9: Case Studies": "Select 3-5 representative scenarios for in-depth case studies. Visualize the uncertainty trajectories and analyze how the model's reasoning changes over time. Include examples where TUDP outperforms baselines and where it faces challenges."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who won the 2020 US Presidential Election? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Joe Biden won the 2020 US Presidential Election. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUDP; Step 1)": "It's November 3, 2020, 7:00 PM EST. The polls for the US Presidential Election have just closed. Based on this information, who do you think will win the 2020 US Presidential Election? Provide your answer and confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUDP; Step 1)": "A: It's too early to determine who will win the 2020 US Presidential Election. At this point, with polls just closed, there isn't enough information to make a confident prediction. Confidence: 10%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUDP; Step 2)": "It's November 4, 2020, 10:00 AM EST. Early results show a close race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with Biden leading in several key swing states. Based on this updated information, who do you think will win the 2020 US Presidential Election? Provide your answer and confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUDP; Step 2)": "A: Based on the early results showing Joe Biden leading in key swing states, it appears that Biden may win the 2020 US Presidential Election. However, the race is still close, and final results are not yet confirmed. Confidence: 60%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TUDP; Step 3)": "It's November 7, 2020, 11:30 AM EST. Major news networks have called the election for Joe Biden, projecting that he has surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win. However, legal challenges have been filed in several states. Based on this information, who do you think won the 2020 US Presidential Election? Provide your answer and confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TUDP; Step 3)": "A: Joe Biden has won the 2020 US Presidential Election. While there are ongoing legal challenges, the projected electoral vote count and calls from major news networks provide strong evidence for this outcome. Confidence: 90%",
            "explanation": "The TUDP method demonstrates how the model's confidence evolves as new information becomes available over time. This dynamic approach captures the uncertainty trajectory, showing initial low confidence, increasing confidence as results come in, and high (but not 100%) confidence even after the election is called due to ongoing legal challenges. In contrast, the baseline method only provides a single static confidence estimate, missing the nuanced evolution of uncertainty over time."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TUDP method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why TUDP fails, potentially revealing insights about LLMs' reasoning processes under uncertainty. 2) Explore variations of TUDP, such as using different prompting strategies or confidence estimation techniques. 3) Investigate how different types of information (e.g., factual vs. speculative) impact uncertainty trajectories. 4) Analyze the relationship between uncertainty dynamics and other aspects of LLM behavior, such as hallucination or consistency. 5) Develop a taxonomy of uncertainty patterns observed across different types of questions or domains, which could inform future research on LLM interpretability and reliability."
