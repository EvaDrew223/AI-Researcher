        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions on tasks they are not well-suited for.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like temperature scaling and ensemble methods often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in different contexts.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring counterfactual scenarios, we can probe the model's robustness and identify potential weaknesses in its reasoning, leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Calibration Through Counterfactual Exploration (CTCE), a novel prompting technique that generates multiple counterfactual scenarios for a given query. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Generate the initial response, 2) Create 3-5 counterfactual scenarios by altering key details of the query, 3) Provide responses for each counterfactual, 4) Analyze how the responses differ across scenarios, 5) Estimate confidence based on response consistency and reasoning stability. The final confidence score is derived from this analysis, with higher consistency indicating greater confidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CTCE against baselines like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on diverse tasks including fact-checking, commonsense reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge tests. Measure performance using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score."

        "Title": "Calibration Through Counterfactual Exploration: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions on tasks they are not well-suited for. This can result in unreliable outputs and potential misuse of the models in critical applications. Existing calibration methods like temperature scaling and ensemble techniques often fail to capture nuanced uncertainties in different contexts, necessitating a more sophisticated approach to uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs often rely on simple heuristics or post-processing techniques that don't fully leverage the model's reasoning capabilities. By exploring counterfactual scenarios, we can probe the model's robustness and identify potential weaknesses in its reasoning, leading to more accurate uncertainty estimates. This approach is inspired by human reasoning, where we often consider alternative scenarios to gauge our confidence in a decision. By prompting the model to engage in this type of reasoning, we aim to achieve more reliable and context-aware uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Calibration Through Counterfactual Exploration (CTCE), a novel prompting technique that generates multiple counterfactual scenarios for a given query. The method consists of the following steps: 1) Generate the initial response to the query. 2) Create 3-5 counterfactual scenarios by altering key details of the query. 3) Provide responses for each counterfactual scenario. 4) Analyze how the responses differ across scenarios. 5) Estimate confidence based on response consistency and reasoning stability. The final confidence score is derived from this analysis, with higher consistency indicating greater confidence. This method allows the model to explore the robustness of its reasoning and identify potential edge cases or uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three diverse datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for fact-checking, 2) CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning, and 3) MedQA for domain-specific (medical) knowledge testing. Each dataset should be split into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. 2) Ensemble method: Use 5 different sampling temperatures (0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3) to generate multiple responses and calculate the agreement rate as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 3: CTCE Implementation": "Implement the CTCE method with the following prompt structure: 'Question: {original_question}\nAnswer: {generate initial answer}\nGenerate 3-5 counterfactual scenarios by changing key details in the question:\n1. {counterfactual_1}\n2. {counterfactual_2}\n3. {counterfactual_3}\nNow, provide answers for each counterfactual scenario:\n1. {answer_1}\n2. {answer_2}\n3. {answer_3}\nAnalyze how the responses differ across scenarios:\n{analysis}\nBased on this analysis, estimate your confidence in the original answer on a scale of 0-100:\n{confidence_score}'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. If resources allow, we will also include Claude from Anthropic as an additional model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and model combination, we will: 1) Generate responses and confidence scores using both baseline methods and CTCE. 2) Calculate evaluation metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier Score, and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). 3) Perform a paired t-test to determine if the differences in performance between CTCE and baselines are statistically significant.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a qualitative analysis of a random sample of 100 examples from each dataset. Examine the generated counterfactuals, their answers, and the model's analysis to gain insights into how CTCE affects the model's reasoning and confidence estimation. Identify patterns in cases where CTCE performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of CTCE: 1) Vary the number of counterfactuals (1, 3, 5, 7) to determine the optimal number. 2) Remove the analysis step to see if simply generating counterfactuals is sufficient. 3) Experiment with different prompts for generating counterfactuals (e.g., 'Create similar questions with slight changes' vs. 'Generate opposite scenarios').",
            "Step 8: Results Compilation": "Compile all quantitative results into tables and graphs, showing performance across different datasets, models, and methods. Summarize key findings from the qualitative analysis and ablation studies."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nHow confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "I am 100% confident in my answer. Paris is widely known and recognized as the capital city of France.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Ensemble Method)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Ensemble Method)": "[Generates 5 responses with different temperatures, all stating 'Paris', resulting in 100% agreement]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CTCE)": "Question: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\nGenerate 3-5 counterfactual scenarios by changing key details in the question:\n1. What was the capital of France before Paris?\n2. What would be the capital of France if it were based on population size?\n3. In an alternate history where Germany won World War II, what might be the capital of France?\nNow, provide answers for each counterfactual scenario:\n1. Before Paris, the capital of France was technically not established as France didn't exist as a unified country. However, previous seats of power included Tournai, Soissons, Paris, Orl\u00e9ans, and Reims during the Merovingian dynasty.\n2. If the capital were based on population size, it would likely still be Paris, as it is the most populous city in France. However, if Paris were excluded, Marseille would be the next largest city.\n3. In an alternate history where Germany won World War II, the capital of France might have been moved to Vichy, which served as the capital of Nazi-occupied France during World War II in our actual history.\nAnalyze how the responses differ across scenarios:\nThe original answer remains consistent across all counterfactual scenarios. Even when considering historical changes or hypothetical situations, Paris is still recognized as the current and most significant capital of France. The counterfactuals explore different aspects of French history and geography but do not contradict the original answer.\nBased on this analysis, estimate your confidence in the original answer on a scale of 0-100:\n98",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CTCE)": "98",
            "Explanation": "CTCE provides a more nuanced confidence score (98) compared to the overconfident baseline methods (100). By exploring counterfactuals, CTCE acknowledges slight uncertainty due to historical changes and hypothetical scenarios, leading to a more calibrated confidence estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CTCE does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will conduct a thorough error analysis to understand why. This may involve: 1) Examining cases where CTCE performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the method. 2) Analyzing the quality and relevance of generated counterfactuals to see if they are effectively probing the model's uncertainty. 3) Investigating whether the model's analysis of counterfactuals is sufficiently insightful or if it's simply restating information without adding value. Based on these findings, we could explore modifications to CTCE, such as: 1) Implementing a more structured approach to counterfactual generation, possibly using templates or guided generation. 2) Incorporating external knowledge or fact-checking steps to improve the quality of counterfactual analyses. 3) Developing a more sophisticated scoring mechanism that takes into account the nature and difficulty of the task when estimating confidence. Additionally, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of how different types of counterfactuals affect model behavior and confidence, potentially uncovering insights about model robustness and decision boundaries across various tasks and domains."
