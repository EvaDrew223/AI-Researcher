    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs often fail to capture the full range of possible completions, leading to underestimation of uncertainty in open-ended tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely on the model's output probabilities or simple ensemble methods, which may not adequately explore the space of possible completions.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly generating and analyzing diverse completions, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's uncertainty, especially in tasks with multiple valid answers or approaches.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Completion Uncertainty (DCU), a prompting technique that leverages the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. For a given query, we first prompt the LLM to generate multiple distinct completions using techniques like 'generate 5 different approaches to answer this question'. Then, we prompt the model to analyze these completions, identifying commonalities, differences, and potential contradictions. Finally, we ask the model to synthesize this analysis into an uncertainty-aware response, explicitly stating areas of high confidence (where completions agree) and low confidence (where they diverge). This method encourages the model to explore a broader solution space and reason about its own uncertainty based on the diversity of possible completions.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate DCU against baseline methods on tasks that benefit from diverse thinking, such as creative writing, problem-solving, and open-ended question answering. Use metrics that assess both the quality and diversity of generated responses, as well as the accuracy of uncertainty estimation. Conduct human evaluation to assess the informativeness and usefulness of the uncertainty-aware responses."

        "Title": "Divergent Completion Uncertainty: Quantifying LLM Uncertainty through Diverse Output Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the full range of possible completions, leading to underestimation of uncertainty in open-ended tasks. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs, especially in scenarios where multiple valid answers or approaches exist.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely on the model's output probabilities or simple ensemble methods, which may not adequately explore the space of possible completions. By explicitly generating and analyzing diverse completions, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's uncertainty, especially in tasks with multiple valid answers or approaches. This method leverages the model's inherent ability to generate diverse outputs and reason about its own uncertainty, potentially offering a more nuanced and accurate representation of uncertainty in LLM outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Completion Uncertainty (DCU), a prompting technique that leverages the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Generate multiple distinct completions for a given query using prompts like 'generate 5 different approaches to answer this question'. 2) Prompt the model to analyze these completions, identifying commonalities, differences, and potential contradictions. 3) Ask the model to synthesize this analysis into an uncertainty-aware response, explicitly stating areas of high confidence (where completions agree) and low confidence (where they diverge).",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that benefit from diverse thinking and have multiple valid approaches or answers. We will use: a) Creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset, b) Open-ended question answering from the AmbigQA dataset, and c) Problem-solving tasks from the GSM8K dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct prompting (single completion), b) Temperature sampling (multiple completions with different temperature values), c) Nucleus sampling (multiple completions with different p values).",
            "Step 3: DCU Implementation": "Implement the DCU method with the following steps: a) Generate 5 distinct completions, b) Analyze completions for similarities and differences, c) Synthesize an uncertainty-aware response.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of DCU. For example: a) 'Generate 5 different approaches to answer this question: [QUESTION]', b) 'Analyze the following completions, identifying commonalities, differences, and potential contradictions: [COMPLETIONS]', c) 'Based on your analysis, provide an uncertainty-aware response that explicitly states areas of high confidence and low confidence: [ANALYSIS]'.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Diversity: measure using self-BLEU and distinct n-grams, b) Quality: use GPT-4 as a judge to rate the quality of responses on a scale of 1-5, c) Uncertainty estimation: compare model's uncertainty estimates with human annotations on a subset of examples.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (50 examples per dataset) to assess the informativeness and usefulness of the uncertainty-aware responses. Use a 5-point Likert scale for ratings.",
            "Step 8: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and DCU. Generate 100 samples per method per dataset.",
            "Step 9: Results Analysis": "Compare DCU against baselines using the defined metrics. Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., t-tests) to validate improvements.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the number of generated completions (3, 5, 7) and analyzing their impact on performance."

            "explanation": "The DCU method generates a more comprehensive and nuanced response by considering multiple perspectives and explicitly addressing areas of uncertainty. This approach provides a clearer picture of what is known with high confidence and what remains uncertain, offering a more informative and reliable output compared to the single-perspective baseline response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DCU method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated diverse completions to understand patterns in LLM reasoning across different prompts and tasks. This could provide insights into the model's knowledge representation and decision-making processes. 2) Investigate how the diversity of completions varies across different types of questions or prompts, potentially uncovering task-specific uncertainty patterns. 3) Explore alternative ways of synthesizing the diverse completions, such as using a separate LLM as an 'expert' to evaluate and combine the outputs. 4) Analyze cases where DCU performs poorly to identify potential limitations of the method and propose improvements. 5) Compare DCU outputs with human-generated diverse responses to benchmark the method's effectiveness in capturing human-like uncertainty. These analyses could turn the project into an insightful study on LLM behavior under diverse prompting conditions, even if the original uncertainty quantification goal is not fully achieved."
