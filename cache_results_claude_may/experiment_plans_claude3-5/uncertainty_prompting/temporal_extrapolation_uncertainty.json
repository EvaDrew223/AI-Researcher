        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with temporal aspects of knowledge, particularly for future predictions or evolving situations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods focus on static knowledge and do not explicitly account for temporal dynamics in uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to consider how knowledge and certainty might change over time, we can achieve more accurate and temporally-aware uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty (TEU), a prompting technique that explicitly incorporates temporal considerations into confidence estimation. The method involves: (1) Initial response and confidence estimation, (2) Prompting the model to consider how the answer might change in the near future, medium-term, and long-term, (3) Estimating confidence for each time horizon, (4) Analyzing potential events or developments that could affect the answer's validity over time, (5) Synthesizing a final confidence estimate that accounts for temporal dynamics. This approach encourages the model to consider the stability of its knowledge over time and how future developments might affect its certainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test TEU on tasks involving predictions about technology, social trends, scientific advancements, and other time-sensitive domains. Compare against standard confidence estimation techniques using metrics like time-calibrated Brier scores and expert evaluations of temporal awareness in uncertainty quantification."

        "Title": "Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models for Time-Sensitive Predictions",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when dealing with temporal aspects of knowledge, particularly for future predictions or evolving situations. This limitation can lead to overconfident or poorly calibrated predictions in time-sensitive domains, potentially resulting in misinformed decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs primarily focus on static knowledge and do not explicitly account for temporal dynamics. By prompting LLMs to consider how knowledge and certainty might change over time, we can achieve more accurate and temporally-aware uncertainty estimates. This approach leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to produce better-calibrated confidence scores for time-sensitive predictions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty (TEU), a prompting technique that explicitly incorporates temporal considerations into confidence estimation. The method involves five key steps: (1) Initial response and confidence estimation, (2) Prompting the model to consider how the answer might change in the near future, medium-term, and long-term, (3) Estimating confidence for each time horizon, (4) Analyzing potential events or developments that could affect the answer's validity over time, (5) Synthesizing a final confidence estimate that accounts for temporal dynamics. This approach encourages the model to consider the stability of its knowledge over time and how future developments might affect its certainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of time-sensitive questions across various domains such as technology trends, scientific advancements, geopolitical events, and economic forecasts. Each question should have a ground truth answer and a time frame associated with it (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 10 years). Use existing datasets like ForecastQA and supplement with manually created questions to ensure diverse temporal aspects.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: (a) Direct prompting with confidence score request, (b) Calibrated softmax probabilities, (c) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: TEU Implementation": "Implement the TEU method with the following sub-steps for each question: (a) Generate initial response and confidence score, (b) Prompt for near-future, medium-term, and long-term changes, (c) Estimate confidence for each time horizon, (d) Analyze potential future events affecting the answer, (e) Synthesize final confidence estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. These models provide strong baseline performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: (a) Apply all baseline methods and record their confidence estimates, (b) Apply the TEU method and record the final confidence estimate, (c) Store intermediate outputs from each step of TEU for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: (a) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), (b) Brier score, (c) Time-calibrated Brier score (weighted by temporal distance), (d) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for binary questions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: (a) Compare TEU performance against baselines across different time horizons, (b) Analyze how confidence estimates change over time for different question types, (c) Identify patterns in the potential future events considered by the model, (d) Evaluate the impact of each TEU step on the final confidence estimate."

                "Input": "Q: Will quantum computers be commercially available for general-purpose computing within the next 5 years? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "Output": "A: No, quantum computers are unlikely to be commercially available for general-purpose computing within the next 5 years. While there has been significant progress in quantum computing research and development, there are still many technical challenges to overcome before they become practical for general-purpose use. Confidence score: 0.8"

                    "Input": "Q: Will quantum computers be commercially available for general-purpose computing within the next 5 years? Provide an initial answer and confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                    "Output": "A: No, quantum computers are unlikely to be commercially available for general-purpose computing within the next 5 years. While there has been significant progress in quantum computing research and development, there are still many technical challenges to overcome before they become practical for general-purpose use. Initial confidence score: 0.8"
                },
                "Step 2 - Temporal Considerations": {
                    "Input": "Consider how your answer might change in the near future (1-2 years), medium-term (3-5 years), and long-term (5-10 years). Provide brief explanations for each time horizon.",
                    "Output": "Near future (1-2 years): The answer is unlikely to change significantly. We may see more specialized quantum computing applications, but general-purpose commercial availability is still far off. Confidence: 0.9\n\nMedium-term (3-5 years): There's a possibility of early commercial quantum computers for specific applications, but general-purpose availability is still unlikely. Some major technical hurdles may be overcome. Confidence: 0.7\n\nLong-term (5-10 years): The likelihood of commercially available general-purpose quantum computers increases substantially. Major breakthroughs in error correction and scalability could occur. Confidence: 0.5"
                },
                "Step 3 - Potential Future Events": {
                    "Input": "Analyze potential events or developments that could significantly affect the answer's validity over time.",
                    "Output": "1. Breakthrough in quantum error correction: This could dramatically accelerate the timeline for practical quantum computers.\n2. Major increase in quantum computing investment: Significant funding could speed up research and development.\n3. Unexpected physical limitations: Discoveries of fundamental limits could delay or prevent general-purpose quantum computing.\n4. Advances in alternative computing paradigms: Developments in neuromorphic or optical computing could reduce focus on quantum computing.\n5. Geopolitical factors: Changes in international collaboration or competition could impact the pace of development."
                },
                "Step 4 - Final Confidence Estimation": {
                    "Input": "Based on the initial response, temporal considerations, and potential future events, synthesize a final confidence estimate for the original question. Explain your reasoning.",
                    "Output": "Final confidence estimate: 0.75\n\nReasoning: The initial high confidence (0.8) in quantum computers not being commercially available for general-purpose computing within 5 years is slightly moderated by considering temporal dynamics and potential future events. The near-term confidence remains high, but the medium-term outlook shows increased uncertainty. The potential for breakthroughs in error correction or major investments could accelerate the timeline, while unexpected limitations could further delay it. The final confidence of 0.75 reflects a slight decrease from the initial estimate, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in this rapidly evolving field while still maintaining a relatively high confidence in the original assessment."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The TEU method provides a more nuanced and temporally-aware confidence estimate compared to the baseline. It explicitly considers how the answer might change over different time horizons and takes into account potential future events that could impact the prediction. This results in a slightly lower but potentially more accurate confidence score that better reflects the uncertainty inherent in long-term technological predictions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the TEU method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of how LLMs reason about temporal uncertainty. This could involve: (1) Analyzing the types of future events and developments that LLMs consider most frequently or deem most impactful. (2) Investigating how the model's confidence changes across different time horizons for various types of questions. (3) Examining the relationship between the model's initial confidence and its ability to generate relevant future scenarios. (4) Comparing the temporal reasoning capabilities of different LLM versions or architectures. (5) Exploring how prompting techniques affect the model's ability to reason about future uncertainties. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in temporal reasoning tasks, potentially informing future research directions in improving LLMs' handling of time-sensitive information and uncertainty estimation."
