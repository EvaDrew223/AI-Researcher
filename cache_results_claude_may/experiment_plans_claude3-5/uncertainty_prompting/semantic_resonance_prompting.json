        "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often struggle to capture nuanced semantic differences that can significantly impact confidence levels.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like ensemble disagreement and token probability analysis often miss subtle semantic variations.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, we propose that confidence levels can be more accurately gauged by measuring how well an LLM's output 'resonates' with slight semantic variations of the input.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Resonance Prompting (SRP), which involves: 1) Generating a set of semantically similar but slightly varied versions of the original prompt. 2) For each variation, prompting the LLM to generate a response and a confidence score. 3) Measuring the 'semantic distance' between these responses using embedding similarity. 4) Calculating a 'resonance score' based on how consistent the responses and confidence scores are across semantic variations. A high resonance score indicates high confidence, while low resonance suggests uncertainty. The prompt for this process would be structured as: 'Given the following variations of a question, please provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100) for each. Then, analyze the consistency of your responses: [list of variations]'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SRP against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble disagreement on diverse tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and ethical dilemmas. Evaluate using calibration metrics and correlation with human judgments of model uncertainty."

        "Title": "Semantic Resonance Prompting: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Input Variation",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to capture nuanced semantic differences that can significantly impact confidence levels. This limitation hinders the reliable assessment of model uncertainty, which is crucial for deploying LLMs in critical applications where understanding the model's confidence is essential.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches like ensemble disagreement and token probability analysis often miss subtle semantic variations that can greatly influence a model's confidence. Inspired by the concept of resonance in physics, we propose that confidence levels can be more accurately gauged by measuring how well an LLM's output 'resonates' with slight semantic variations of the input. This approach leverages the LLM's own semantic understanding to provide a more nuanced and context-aware measure of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Resonance Prompting (SRP), which involves: 1) Generating a set of semantically similar but slightly varied versions of the original prompt. 2) For each variation, prompting the LLM to generate a response and a confidence score. 3) Measuring the 'semantic distance' between these responses using embedding similarity. 4) Calculating a 'resonance score' based on how consistent the responses and confidence scores are across semantic variations.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering factual QA (e.g., TriviaQA), commonsense reasoning (e.g., COPA), and ethical dilemmas (e.g., Moral Scenarios). Ensure a mix of questions with varying difficulty levels and ambiguity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. 2) Ensemble disagreement: Use multiple model instances or sampling techniques to generate multiple answers and calculate disagreement.",
            "Step 3: SRP Implementation": "Develop the SRP method: a) Create a prompt template for generating semantic variations. b) Implement a function to generate embeddings for responses. c) Develop a method to calculate the resonance score based on response similarity and confidence scores.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of SRP: 1) Variation generation: 'Generate 5 semantically similar variations of the following question: [original question]' 2) Answer and confidence elicitation: 'For each of the following questions, provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100): [list of variations]' 3) Consistency analysis: 'Analyze the consistency of your responses to the previous questions. Provide a resonance score (0-100) based on how consistent your answers and confidence scores were.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the main experiments. Additionally, use open-source models like FLAN-T5 and LLaMA-2 for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods. b) Run the SRP method. c) Collect answers, confidence scores, and resonance scores.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the methods using: 1) Calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error) 2) Correlation with human judgments of model uncertainty (collect a small set of human annotations) 3) Performance on downstream tasks (e.g., selective prediction)",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: a) Compare SRP performance against baselines across different task types. b) Analyze how resonance scores correlate with actual model performance. c) Investigate cases where SRP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Direct Confidence Output": "Answer: Paris, Confidence: 95",
                "Ensemble Disagreement Output": "Answers: [Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris], Disagreement Score: 0.0"
            },
            "SRP Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Variation Generation": [
                    "Which city serves as the capital of France?",
                    "What is the primary city and seat of government in France?",
                    "If I were to visit the capital of France, which city would I be in?",
                    "What French city is known for being the nation's capital?",
                    "In terms of capital cities, which one represents France?"
                ],
                "Answer and Confidence Elicitation": [
                    "Paris, 98",
                    "Paris, 97",
                    "Paris, 99",
                    "Paris, 98",
                    "Paris, 97"
                ],
                "Resonance Score": "99 - The answers and confidence scores are highly consistent across all variations, indicating a very high level of certainty."
            },
            "Explanation": "In this example, both baseline methods and SRP indicate high confidence. However, SRP provides a more nuanced view by considering multiple semantic variations, potentially offering better robustness against single-prompt biases."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If SRP doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why semantic variations don't impact model confidence as expected. We could investigate: 1) The quality and diversity of generated semantic variations. 2) How different types of questions (factual, opinion-based, ambiguous) affect resonance scores. 3) The relationship between embedding similarity and actual semantic similarity in the context of uncertainty quantification. 4) How model size and architecture influence the effectiveness of SRP. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs and inform future approaches to uncertainty quantification."
