        "Problem": "Static prompting methods for uncertainty quantification often fail to adapt to the specific challenges and nuances of individual queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current approaches use fixed prompts or templated strategies for confidence elicitation.",
        "Motivation": "The most effective way to probe an LLM's uncertainty may vary depending on the query's content, difficulty, and domain. An adaptive prompting strategy could lead to more accurate and context-appropriate uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce an iterative prompting framework: (1) Initial Probe: Start with a general uncertainty estimation prompt. (2) Response Analysis: Use the LLM to analyze its own response, identifying potential areas of uncertainty or inconsistency. (3) Prompt Refinement: Based on this analysis, generate a more targeted follow-up prompt to probe specific uncertainty aspects. (4) Iterate: Repeat steps 2-3, evolving the prompts to increasingly focus on key uncertainty factors. (5) Final Synthesis: Prompt the LLM to synthesize insights from all iterations into a comprehensive uncertainty assessment.",

        "Title": "Adaptive Iterative Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Static prompting methods for uncertainty quantification often fail to adapt to the specific challenges and nuances of individual queries, leading to inaccurate or inconsistent uncertainty estimates in large language models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods primarily rely on fixed prompts or templated strategies for confidence elicitation, which may not capture the full spectrum of uncertainty across diverse query types. The most effective way to probe an LLM's uncertainty likely varies depending on the query's content, difficulty, and domain. An adaptive prompting strategy could lead to more accurate and context-appropriate uncertainty estimates by tailoring the probing process to each specific query.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce an iterative adaptive prompting framework for uncertainty quantification: (1) Initial Probe: Begin with a general uncertainty estimation prompt. (2) Response Analysis: Use the LLM to analyze its own response, identifying potential areas of uncertainty or inconsistency. (3) Prompt Refinement: Based on this analysis, generate a more targeted follow-up prompt to probe specific uncertainty aspects. (4) Iterate: Repeat steps 2-3, evolving the prompts to increasingly focus on key uncertainty factors. (5) Final Synthesis: Prompt the LLM to synthesize insights from all iterations into a comprehensive uncertainty assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets, including: (a) TruthfulQA for factual queries, (b) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and (c) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. Select 100 questions from each dataset, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (a) Direct prompting: Ask the question followed by 'How confident are you in your answer?', (b) Likelihood-based: Use the model's output probabilities as a proxy for confidence, (c) Ensemble method: Generate multiple answers and use their consistency as a measure of confidence.",
            "Step 3: Adaptive Prompting Implementation": "Implement the proposed method with the following sub-steps: (a) Initial probe: 'Answer the following question and rate your confidence from 0-100%: [QUESTION]', (b) Response analysis: 'Analyze your previous response. Identify any areas of uncertainty or potential inconsistencies.', (c) Prompt refinement: 'Based on the analysis, generate a follow-up question to probe the main area of uncertainty.', (d) Iteration: Repeat steps b and c for 3 iterations, (e) Final synthesis: 'Synthesize all previous responses and provide a final answer with a calibrated uncertainty estimate.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: (a) Calibration error: Compare model confidence to actual accuracy, (b) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions, (c) AUROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: (a) Apply all baseline methods and record their uncertainty estimates, (b) Apply the adaptive prompting method, recording intermediate steps and final uncertainty estimate, (c) Calculate evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct the following analyses: (a) Compare average performance of baseline methods vs. adaptive prompting across all metrics, (b) Analyze how prompts evolve across iterations for different question types, (c) Identify patterns in which types of questions benefit most from adaptive prompting, (d) Examine cases where adaptive prompting performs worse than baselines to understand limitations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in my answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Initial Probe)": "Answer the following question and rate your confidence from 0-100%: What is the capital of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Initial Probe)": "The capital of France is Paris. I am 100% confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Response Analysis)": "Analyze your previous response. Identify any areas of uncertainty or potential inconsistencies.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Response Analysis)": "In my previous response, I stated that the capital of France is Paris with 100% confidence. Upon reflection, while I am highly confident in this answer, it's generally advisable to leave a small margin for uncertainty in most cases. There could be extremely rare scenarios where this information might be outdated (e.g., if there had been a very recent change in government structure that I'm not aware of). However, the likelihood of this is extremely low.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Prompt Refinement)": "Based on the analysis, generate a follow-up question to probe the main area of uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Prompt Refinement)": "Has there been any recent news or official announcements about changes to France's capital city or government structure that might affect the status of Paris as the capital?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Final Synthesis)": "Synthesize all previous responses and provide a final answer with a calibrated uncertainty estimate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Final Synthesis)": "After careful consideration and analysis, I can state with very high confidence (99.9%) that Paris is the capital of France. The 0.1% uncertainty accounts for the extremely unlikely possibility of very recent, unannounced changes. However, there is no evidence to suggest any such changes, and Paris has been the capital of France for centuries. This level of confidence is appropriate for well-established, historically consistent facts.",
            "Explanation": "The adaptive prompting method allows for a more nuanced exploration of uncertainty. While the baseline method might lead to overconfident answers, the iterative process encourages the model to consider potential sources of uncertainty, leading to a more calibrated final estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed adaptive prompting method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the intermediate steps to understand where the method falls short. This could involve categorizing the types of follow-up questions generated and their effectiveness in probing uncertainty. We could also investigate whether certain question types or domains benefit more from this approach than others. Additionally, we might explore combining our method with other techniques, such as using multiple model temperatures or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the uncertainty estimates. Another direction could be to focus on the interpretability aspect, analyzing how the model's reasoning about its own uncertainty evolves through the iterations. This could provide valuable insights into the model's internal representation of confidence and uncertainty, potentially informing future approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs."
