        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods often fail to capture how model confidence evolves and propagates over time, particularly for tasks involving sequential reasoning or dynamic information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically provide static confidence estimates or simple time-series analysis of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by diffusion processes in physics and information theory, we hypothesize that model uncertainty exhibits complex temporal dynamics that can be better understood through a diffusion-based analysis.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Confidence Diffusion (TCD), a prompting technique that models the evolution and propagation of uncertainty over time. The method involves: 1) Decomposing a task into a sequence of timesteps or reasoning stages. 2) At each step, prompting the model to estimate its current confidence and how it expects this confidence to 'diffuse' to future steps. 3) Analyzing the resulting confidence diffusion patterns to understand how uncertainty propagates and accumulates over time. This approach reveals temporal dependencies in model uncertainty and identifies critical points where confidence significantly changes.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TCD against standard uncertainty estimation methods on tasks involving temporal reasoning, such as multi-step planning problems and dynamic question answering.

        "Title": "Temporal Confidence Diffusion: Modeling Uncertainty Propagation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for large language models (LLMs) often fail to capture how model confidence evolves and propagates over time, particularly for tasks involving sequential reasoning or dynamic information. This limitation hinders our understanding of model reliability in complex, multi-step tasks and impedes the development of more robust AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically provide static confidence estimates or simple time-series analysis of uncertainty, which are inadequate for capturing the complex temporal dynamics of model uncertainty in sequential reasoning tasks. Inspired by diffusion processes in physics and information theory, we hypothesize that model uncertainty exhibits intricate temporal dynamics that can be better understood through a diffusion-based analysis. By modeling how confidence 'diffuses' through a reasoning chain, we can gain deeper insights into the reliability of LLMs in complex tasks and potentially develop more accurate uncertainty estimation methods.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Confidence Diffusion (TCD), a prompting technique that models the evolution and propagation of uncertainty over time in LLM reasoning. The method involves three main steps: 1) Decomposing a task into a sequence of timesteps or reasoning stages. 2) At each step, prompting the model to estimate its current confidence and how it expects this confidence to 'diffuse' to future steps. 3) Analyzing the resulting confidence diffusion patterns to understand how uncertainty propagates and accumulates over time. This approach aims to reveal temporal dependencies in model uncertainty and identify critical points where confidence significantly changes.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve multi-step reasoning: 1) GSM8K for multi-step math problem-solving, 2) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, and 3) FEVER for fact verification. These datasets will be preprocessed to identify clear reasoning steps.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Static confidence estimation: Use the model's softmax output or perplexity as a confidence measure. 2) Simple temporal confidence: Track confidence at each step without modeling diffusion.",
            "Step 3: TCD Implementation": "Implement the Temporal Confidence Diffusion method: a) Decompose each problem into steps. b) For each step, prompt the model to estimate current confidence and predict future confidence. c) Aggregate confidence estimates to create a diffusion pattern.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Prompting Strategy": "Design prompts for each step of TCD. For example: 'Given the current step of the problem: [STEP], estimate your confidence in your answer (0-100%). Then, predict how your confidence might change in the next 2 steps and explain why.'",
            "Step 6: Data Collection": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and TCD. Collect confidence estimates, diffusion patterns, and final answers for each problem.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate methods using: 1) Accuracy of final answers. 2) Calibration of confidence estimates (using Brier score). 3) Correlation between confidence patterns and answer correctness.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze diffusion patterns to identify: 1) Common confidence trajectories. 2) Critical points where confidence changes significantly. 3) Relationship between diffusion patterns and task difficulty or model performance.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying: 1) Number of diffusion steps. 2) Prompt formulations. 3) Model sizes (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4).",
            "Step 10: Visualization": "Create visualizations of confidence diffusion patterns to aid in interpretation and analysis of results."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: If 8 workers can build a house in 10 days working 6 hours per day, how many days will it take 6 workers to build the same house working 8 hours per day? Please solve this step-by-step and provide your confidence level (0-100%) for each step.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Step 1: Calculate total work hours for 8 workers (Confidence: 90%)\n8 workers * 10 days * 6 hours/day = 480 total work hours\n\nStep 2: Set up equation for 6 workers (Confidence: 85%)\n6 workers * x days * 8 hours/day = 480 total work hours\n\nStep 3: Solve for x (Confidence: 80%)\n48x = 480\nx = 480 / 48 = 10 days\n\nFinal Answer: It will take 6 workers 10 days to build the house working 8 hours per day. (Overall Confidence: 85%)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCD Step 1)": "Q: If 8 workers can build a house in 10 days working 6 hours per day, how many days will it take 6 workers to build the same house working 8 hours per day? Let's approach this step-by-step. For the first step, calculate the total work hours for 8 workers. What's your confidence in this step (0-100%)? How do you expect your confidence to change in the next two steps and why?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCD Step 1)": "Step 1: Calculate total work hours for 8 workers\n8 workers * 10 days * 6 hours/day = 480 total work hours\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nExpected confidence changes:\nNext step: 90% - Slight decrease as we set up the equation for 6 workers, which introduces a variable.\nStep after next: 85% - Further slight decrease as we solve the equation, which involves division and may introduce rounding errors.\n\nReasoning: The first step is straightforward multiplication, hence the high confidence. The following steps involve more complex operations and introduce variables, which may slightly increase the chance of errors.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCD Step 2)": "Great. Now for the second step, set up the equation for 6 workers. What's your confidence in this step? How do you expect your confidence to change in the next step and why?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCD Step 2)": "Step 2: Set up equation for 6 workers\n6 workers * x days * 8 hours/day = 480 total work hours\n\nConfidence: 92%\n\nExpected confidence change:\nNext step: 88% - Slight decrease as we solve the equation, which involves division and may introduce rounding errors.\n\nReasoning: Setting up the equation is relatively straightforward, hence the high confidence. The next step involves solving the equation, which is slightly more complex and may introduce minor calculation errors, leading to a small decrease in confidence.",
            "Explanation": "The TCD method provides a more nuanced view of the model's confidence throughout the problem-solving process. It captures how confidence might change between steps and why, offering insights into the model's reasoning process and potential sources of uncertainty. This granular information can help identify where the model might be prone to errors or uncertainty, which is not captured by the baseline method's static confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCD method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why TCD failed to capture uncertainty better than baselines. This could involve examining specific cases where TCD performed poorly and analyzing the generated confidence diffusion patterns. 2) Explore alternative formulations of the diffusion process, such as using different time scales or incorporating task-specific knowledge into the diffusion model. 3) Investigate how different prompting strategies affect the model's ability to estimate and propagate uncertainty. This could lead to insights on how to better elicit uncertainty information from LLMs. 4) Analyze the relationship between confidence diffusion patterns and various task characteristics (e.g., task difficulty, number of reasoning steps) to identify potential limitations of the method and areas for improvement. 5) Compare TCD's performance across different model sizes and architectures to understand how model capacity affects uncertainty estimation in sequential reasoning tasks. These analyses could yield valuable insights into LLM behavior and uncertainty estimation, potentially leading to a strong analysis paper even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
