        "Problem": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on scalar confidence scores, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically use softmax probabilities or calibrated scalar confidence scores.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the human ability to visualize complex distributions, we propose a method that prompts LLMs to generate visual representations of their uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Visualization Prompting (CSVP), which asks the LLM to generate a textual ASCII plot representing its confidence distribution across possible answers. The prompt includes instructions like 'Generate an ASCII histogram showing your confidence levels for different answer options.' The LLM then produces a visual representation of its uncertainty, which can be parsed to extract more nuanced information about its confidence levels.",

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Visualization Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on scalar confidence scores, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty. This limitation can lead to overconfident or underconfident predictions, potentially resulting in unreliable or misleading outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use softmax probabilities or calibrated scalar confidence scores, which provide limited insight into the model's uncertainty distribution. Inspired by the human ability to visualize complex distributions, we propose a method that prompts LLMs to generate visual representations of their uncertainty. This approach aims to leverage the LLMs' inherent capabilities to produce more nuanced and informative uncertainty representations, potentially leading to better-calibrated and more interpretable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Visualization Prompting (CSVP), which asks the LLM to generate a textual ASCII plot representing its confidence distribution across possible answers. The prompt includes instructions like 'Generate an ASCII histogram showing your confidence levels for different answer options.' The LLM then produces a visual representation of its uncertainty, which can be parsed to extract more nuanced information about its confidence levels. This method allows for a richer representation of uncertainty compared to scalar confidence scores.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover various domains and difficulty levels. We will use: 1) TriviaQA for general knowledge questions, 2) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension tasks with unanswerable questions, and 3) MMLU for multi-task language understanding across various academic domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard softmax probabilities, and 2) Temperature scaling for calibration. For each baseline, we will use the top-k (k=5) probabilities as the confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: CSVP Implementation": "Develop the CSVP method by creating prompts that instruct the LLM to generate ASCII histograms representing its confidence distribution. Example prompt: 'Based on the given question, generate an ASCII histogram showing your confidence levels for different answer options. Use a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is least confident and 10 is most confident. Provide labels for each bar.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods to get scalar confidence scores. b) Apply CSVP to generate confidence visualizations. c) Parse the ASCII histograms to extract numerical confidence values for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure calibration. 2) Brier Score to assess probabilistic forecast accuracy. 3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) to evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall at various confidence thresholds.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare CSVP against the baseline methods using the implemented metrics. Analyze the richness of uncertainty information provided by CSVP, including the shape of the confidence distribution and the presence of multi-modal confidence patterns.",
            "Step 8: Visualization Quality Assessment": "Develop a rubric to assess the quality and informativeness of the generated ASCII visualizations. Criteria may include clarity, accuracy of representation, and alignment with the question difficulty.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the prompt instructions (e.g., changing the scale, using different visualization types) to understand the impact of prompt design on the quality of uncertainty representation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris, London, Berlin, Madrid, Rome",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Confidence scores: Paris (0.92), London (0.05), Berlin (0.02), Madrid (0.01), Rome (0.00)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris, London, Berlin, Madrid, Rome\nGenerate an ASCII histogram showing your confidence levels for different answer options. Use a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is least confident and 10 is most confident. Provide labels for each bar.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Confidence levels for the capital of France:\n\nParis    |\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10\nLondon   |\u2588         | 1\nBerlin   |          | 0\nMadrid   |          | 0\nRome     |          | 0\n\n0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10\nLeast confident                       Most confident",
            "Explanation": "The CSVP method provides a more detailed and visually interpretable representation of the model's confidence across different answer options. This allows for better understanding of the uncertainty distribution, including any potential multi-modal patterns or unexpected confidence assignments."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSVP method does not significantly outperform the baselines in terms of calibration or uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated visualizations to understand why they might not be capturing uncertainty effectively. This could involve categorizing different types of visualization patterns and their relationship to question difficulty or domain. 2) Explore hybrid approaches that combine CSVP with traditional scalar confidence methods, potentially leveraging the strengths of both. 3) Investigate the impact of CSVP on human interpretability of model uncertainty, even if quantitative metrics don't show improvement. This could involve a small-scale human evaluation study to assess whether CSVP helps users better understand model confidence. 4) Analyze cases where CSVP performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines, which could provide insights into the types of questions or domains where visual uncertainty representation is most beneficial."
