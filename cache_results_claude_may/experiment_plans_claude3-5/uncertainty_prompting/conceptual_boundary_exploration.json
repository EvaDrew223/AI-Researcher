    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately gauge their uncertainty in areas where their knowledge boundaries are unclear or where concepts overlap in complex ways.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble-based approaches, which may not capture nuanced uncertainty at conceptual boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly probing the boundaries and intersections of an LLM's conceptual understanding, we can potentially achieve more accurate and nuanced uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Boundary Exploration (CBE), a prompting technique that maps out the edges of an LLM's knowledge to calibrate confidence. The process involves: 1) Given a query, prompt the LLM to identify related concepts and potential areas of conceptual overlap or confusion. 2) Generate a series of 'boundary-pushing' questions that test the limits of the LLM's understanding in these areas. 3) Prompt the LLM to attempt answers and explicitly reason about its certainty for each boundary question. 4) Analyze patterns in confidence across boundary questions to build a 'conceptual uncertainty map'. 5) Use this map to calibrate confidence for the original query through a final meta-prompt.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CBE against baseline confidence estimation methods on a diverse set of queries designed to probe conceptual boundaries. Evaluate using metrics like calibration error and the ability to identify areas of high conceptual uncertainty. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated conceptual uncertainty maps."

        "Title": "Conceptual Boundary Exploration: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models through Nuanced Uncertainty Quantification",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately gauge their uncertainty, particularly in areas where their knowledge boundaries are unclear or where concepts overlap in complex ways. This leads to overconfidence in incorrect answers and underconfidence in correct ones, reducing the reliability and usefulness of these models in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble-based approaches. However, these methods often fail to capture the nuanced uncertainty at conceptual boundaries. By explicitly probing the edges of an LLM's knowledge and understanding, we can potentially achieve more accurate and fine-grained uncertainty quantification. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often explore the limits of our knowledge to gauge our confidence in a particular domain.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Boundary Exploration (CBE), a prompting technique that maps out the edges of an LLM's knowledge to calibrate confidence. The process involves five key steps: 1) Given a query, prompt the LLM to identify related concepts and potential areas of conceptual overlap or confusion. 2) Generate a series of 'boundary-pushing' questions that test the limits of the LLM's understanding in these areas. 3) Prompt the LLM to attempt answers and explicitly reason about its certainty for each boundary question. 4) Analyze patterns in confidence across boundary questions to build a 'conceptual uncertainty map'. 5) Use this map to calibrate confidence for the original query through a final meta-prompt.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of queries from the TruthfulQA dataset, which contains questions designed to probe model truthfulness and calibration. We will also create a custom set of 100 questions spanning various domains (science, history, current events, etc.) with varying levels of difficulty and conceptual ambiguity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Append 'How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?' to each query. 2) Ensemble method: Use 5 different prompts for each query and calculate the variance in responses as a proxy for uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: CBE Implementation": "For each query: a) Prompt for related concepts: 'What are the key concepts related to this query? Identify any areas where these concepts might overlap or be confusing.' b) Generate boundary questions: 'Based on the identified concepts, generate 5 questions that push the boundaries of understanding in this area.' c) Answer and reason about certainty: For each boundary question, prompt with 'Answer this question and explain your reasoning. Then, rate your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100 and explain why.' d) Build conceptual uncertainty map: Analyze the confidence ratings and explanations to create a map of conceptual uncertainty. e) Final calibration: Use a meta-prompt like 'Based on your answers to the boundary questions and your conceptual uncertainty map, what is your final confidence in your answer to the original query? Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as our primary models, accessed through their respective APIs. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the methods using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare model confidence to actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: Measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) AUC-ROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence. 4) Qualitative analysis: Manually review a subset of responses to assess the quality and interpretability of the conceptual uncertainty maps and final calibrated confidences.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CBE against the baseline methods across all metrics. Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in the CBE process. Analyze how performance varies across different types of queries and domains."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer on a scale of 0-100?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE; Step 1: Identify Related Concepts)": "Q: What is the capital of France? What are the key concepts related to this query? Identify any areas where these concepts might overlap or be confusing.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE; Step 1: Identify Related Concepts)": "Key concepts related to this query:\n1. Capital cities\n2. French geography\n3. European political structures\n4. Historical changes in capital cities\n\nPotential areas of overlap or confusion:\n1. The distinction between cultural and political capitals\n2. Historical changes in the capital of France\n3. The role of other major French cities",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE; Step 2: Generate Boundary Questions)": "Based on the identified concepts, generate 5 questions that push the boundaries of understanding in this area.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE; Step 2: Generate Boundary Questions)": "1. Has Paris always been the capital of France throughout history?\n2. Are there any other cities in France that have served as the capital?\n3. How does the political importance of Paris compare to other major French cities like Lyon or Marseille?\n4. In what ways might Paris be considered a 'cultural capital' beyond its official political status?\n5. How did the French Revolution affect Paris's status as the capital?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE; Step 3: Answer and Reason About Certainty)": "Answer this question and explain your reasoning: Has Paris always been the capital of France throughout history? Then, rate your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100 and explain why.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE; Step 3: Answer and Reason About Certainty)": "Answer: No, Paris has not always been the capital of France throughout history. While it has been the capital for most of France's modern history, there were periods when other cities served as the capital.\n\nReasoning: The history of France's capital is complex. Paris became the capital under Hugh Capet in 987 AD, but before that, other cities like Tournai, Soissons, Paris, Orl\u00e9ans, and Reims had been capitals of the Frankish kingdoms. During the Hundred Years' War, the English occupied Paris, and the French capital was moved to Bourges. Later, during the French Revolution and Napoleonic era, there were brief periods when other cities like Versailles played a central role.\n\nConfidence: 90\n\nExplanation of confidence: I'm highly confident in the general accuracy of this information, as it's well-documented in historical records. However, I'm not giving it a 100 because there might be some nuances or brief periods I'm not aware of, and the concept of 'capital' itself has evolved over time, which could lead to some ambiguity in interpretation for certain historical periods.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE; Step 4: Build Conceptual Uncertainty Map)": "Based on the answers and confidence ratings for the boundary questions, create a conceptual uncertainty map for the query 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE; Step 4: Build Conceptual Uncertainty Map)": "Conceptual Uncertainty Map for 'What is the capital of France?':\n\n1. Current status (Confidence: 100)\n   - Paris is the current capital of France\n\n2. Historical consistency (Confidence: 90)\n   - Paris has been the capital for most of modern history\n   - Other cities have served as capitals in the past\n\n3. Political vs. Cultural capital (Confidence: 85)\n   - Paris is undoubtedly the political capital\n   - Its status as a cultural capital is less formally defined but widely accepted\n\n4. Comparison to other French cities (Confidence: 95)\n   - Paris is significantly more important politically than other major cities\n   - Other cities have their own regional importance\n\n5. Impact of historical events (Confidence: 80)\n   - Major events like the French Revolution affected Paris's role\n   - Exact details of how these events changed the capital's status are less certain\n\nOverall, there is high confidence in Paris's current status as the capital, with some uncertainty around historical details and the precise nature of its cultural significance.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CBE; Step 5: Final Calibration)": "Based on your answers to the boundary questions and your conceptual uncertainty map, what is your final confidence in your answer to the original query 'What is the capital of France?' Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CBE; Step 5: Final Calibration)": "Final confidence: 99\n\nReasoning: After exploring the conceptual boundaries related to the capital of France, I maintain very high confidence that Paris is the current capital of France. The exploration revealed no significant uncertainties about its current status. The slight reduction from 100 to 99 reflects the historical complexities and the nuanced understanding gained from the boundary questions.\n\nKey factors influencing this confidence:\n1. There is absolute certainty about Paris's current status as the capital.\n2. The historical exploration revealed that while Paris has not always been the capital, it has consistently held this position for most of modern history.\n3. The distinction between political and cultural capital adds depth to the understanding but doesn't challenge Paris's official status.\n4. Comparisons with other French cities reinforced Paris's primacy.\n5. While historical events have impacted Paris's role, they haven't displaced its current status.\n\nThe 1% uncertainty accounts for any potential extremely recent changes or nuances in the definition of 'capital' that might not be captured in my knowledge cutoff. This calibrated confidence reflects a more nuanced and robust understanding of the query, acknowledging the complexity behind what initially seemed a straightforward question.",
            "explanation": "The CBE method provides a more nuanced and well-reasoned confidence assessment compared to the baseline. It explores related concepts, probes knowledge boundaries, and builds a conceptual uncertainty map, leading to a final calibrated confidence that is both high and well-justified. This process helps identify potential areas of uncertainty that might not be apparent in a simple direct confidence elicitation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CBE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines in calibration metrics, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why CBE fails, potentially revealing insights about LLM reasoning processes. 2) Explore variations of the CBE method, such as adjusting the number or type of boundary questions, or experimenting with different ways of constructing the conceptual uncertainty map. 3) Investigate how the effectiveness of CBE varies across different types of queries or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Combine CBE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it to inform ensemble weights or as a pre-processing step for other calibration techniques. 5) Focus on the interpretability aspects of CBE, analyzing how the generated conceptual maps and reasoning processes can provide valuable insights even if they don't directly improve calibration metrics."
