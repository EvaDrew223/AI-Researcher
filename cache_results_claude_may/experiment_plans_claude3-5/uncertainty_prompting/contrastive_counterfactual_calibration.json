        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when faced with novel or counterfactual scenarios that deviate from their training distribution.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current uncertainty quantification methods typically focus on in-distribution performance and do not explicitly address counterfactual reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging the LLM's ability to reason about counterfactuals and contrasting them with factual knowledge, we can potentially improve uncertainty estimates for novel or hypothetical scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Counterfactual Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that elicits uncertainty estimates by contrasting factual and counterfactual scenarios. The process involves: 1) Presenting a factual query and requesting an answer with confidence, 2) Generating a related counterfactual scenario by altering key elements of the query, 3) Requesting an answer and confidence estimate for the counterfactual scenario, 4) Prompting the LLM to compare and contrast its reasoning and confidence between the factual and counterfactual cases, 5) Based on this analysis, generating refined uncertainty estimates for both scenarios that account for the differences in reasoning and knowledge reliability between factual and counterfactual domains.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCC on a dataset of paired factual and counterfactual queries across various domains. Compare performance against standard uncertainty estimation methods, with a focus on calibration quality for out-of-distribution and hypothetical scenarios. Metrics include calibration error, Brier score, and human evaluation of the plausibility of uncertainty estimates in counterfactual scenarios."

        "Title": "Contrastive Counterfactual Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty when faced with novel or counterfactual scenarios that deviate from their training distribution. This leads to overconfident predictions in out-of-distribution situations, potentially causing critical errors in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs typically focus on in-distribution performance and do not explicitly address counterfactual reasoning. By leveraging the LLM's ability to reason about counterfactuals and contrasting them with factual knowledge, we can potentially improve uncertainty estimates for novel or hypothetical scenarios. This approach aligns with human cognitive processes, where we often gauge our confidence by comparing unfamiliar situations to known ones.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Counterfactual Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that elicits uncertainty estimates by contrasting factual and counterfactual scenarios. The process involves five steps: 1) Presenting a factual query and requesting an answer with confidence, 2) Generating a related counterfactual scenario by altering key elements of the query, 3) Requesting an answer and confidence estimate for the counterfactual scenario, 4) Prompting the LLM to compare and contrast its reasoning and confidence between the factual and counterfactual cases, 5) Based on this analysis, generating refined uncertainty estimates for both scenarios that account for the differences in reasoning and knowledge reliability between factual and counterfactual domains.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of paired factual and counterfactual queries across various domains. We will use a combination of existing datasets (e.g., TruthfulQA, MMLU) and generate new pairs. For each factual query, create a counterfactual version by altering key elements while maintaining the overall structure. Aim for 1000 pairs covering diverse topics.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty estimation methods as baselines: 1) Direct probability output, 2) Temperature scaling, 3) Ensemble methods (using different seeds or model versions), 4) Monte Carlo Dropout (for open-source models).",
            "Step 3: CCC Prompt Design": "Design the CCC prompt template with the following structure: 1) Factual query, 2) Request for factual answer and confidence, 3) Generated counterfactual query, 4) Request for counterfactual answer and confidence, 5) Instruction to compare and contrast reasoning, 6) Request for refined uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API as primary models. Also include open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each query pair: 1) Apply baseline methods, 2) Apply CCC method, 3) Store all outputs, including intermediate steps for CCC.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: 1) Calibration error (Expected Calibration Error, Maximum Calibration Error), 2) Brier score, 3) Log loss, 4) AUC-ROC for binary classification tasks.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Design a human evaluation protocol to assess the plausibility of uncertainty estimates in counterfactual scenarios. Use a 5-point Likert scale for rating the reasonableness of the model's confidence.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "1) Compare CCC performance against baselines using the implemented metrics, 2) Analyze how CCC performance varies across different domains and types of counterfactuals, 3) Examine the correlation between human judgments and CCC estimates, 4) Investigate cases where CCC significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q1 (Factual): What is the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).\nQ2 (Counterfactual): In an alternate history where the French Revolution failed and the monarchy remained in power, what would be the capital of France? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).\nCompare and contrast your reasoning and confidence between the factual and counterfactual scenarios. Then, provide refined uncertainty estimates for both scenarios.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "A1 (Factual): The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 99%\nA2 (Counterfactual): In this alternate history, the capital of France would likely still be Versailles. Confidence: 70%\nComparison: For the factual scenario, my confidence is very high because Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, and this is widely known and documented. For the counterfactual scenario, my confidence is lower because it involves speculation about an alternate history. While Versailles was the seat of power for the French monarchy before the revolution, there's uncertainty about whether it would have remained so in this hypothetical scenario.\nRefined estimates:\nFactual: Paris, 99% confidence (unchanged due to strong historical evidence)\nCounterfactual: Versailles, 65% confidence (slightly lowered to reflect the inherent uncertainty in counterfactual reasoning)",
            "Explanation": "The CCC method prompts the model to explicitly consider the differences between factual and counterfactual scenarios, leading to a more nuanced uncertainty estimate for the counterfactual case. The baseline method, in contrast, might give an overconfident answer for the counterfactual scenario if asked directly, as it doesn't prompt the model to consider the hypothetical nature of the question."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CCC method doesn't show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why CCC fails. This might reveal specific types of queries or domains where the method is less effective, leading to insights about LLM reasoning. Second, we could explore variations of the CCC method, such as iterative refinement of counterfactuals or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the counterfactual reasoning. Third, we could shift focus to analyzing how LLMs reason about counterfactuals more generally, using the collected data to study patterns in how models generate and evaluate counterfactual scenarios. This could lead to a paper on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in counterfactual reasoning, which would be valuable for understanding these models' potential in causal inference tasks."
