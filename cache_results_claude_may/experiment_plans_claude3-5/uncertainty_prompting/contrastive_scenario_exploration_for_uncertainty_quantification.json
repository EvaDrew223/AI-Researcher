        "Problem": "LLMs often provide overconfident responses without considering alternative scenarios or edge cases that could affect the certainty of their answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on direct confidence estimation or calibration without explicitly exploring contrastive scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by contrastive learning in computer vision and the use of counterexamples in formal logic, we propose that exploring contrastive scenarios can lead to more robust uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Uncertainty Quantification (CSEUQ). Given an initial query and response, we prompt the LLM to generate a set of contrastive scenarios that could potentially change the answer or affect its certainty. For each scenario, the model is asked to reassess its answer and confidence. We then aggregate these contrastive explorations, analyzing how often and under what conditions the model's answer or confidence changes. This aggregated information is used to produce a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for the robustness of the answer across various scenarios.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test CSEUQ on a diverse set of tasks including factual QA, commonsense reasoning, and predictive tasks. Compare against standard confidence estimation methods and evaluate improvements in identifying edge cases, reducing overconfidence, and providing more nuanced uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide overconfident responses without considering alternative scenarios or edge cases that could affect the certainty of their answers. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on direct confidence estimation or calibration without explicitly exploring contrastive scenarios. Inspired by contrastive learning in computer vision and the use of counterexamples in formal logic, we propose that exploring contrastive scenarios can lead to more robust uncertainty quantification. By prompting LLMs to generate and evaluate alternative scenarios, we can better assess the model's confidence across various potential outcomes, leading to more nuanced and reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Scenario Exploration for Uncertainty Quantification (CSEUQ). Given an initial query and response, we prompt the LLM to generate a set of contrastive scenarios that could potentially change the answer or affect its certainty. For each scenario, the model is asked to reassess its answer and confidence. We then aggregate these contrastive explorations, analyzing how often and under what conditions the model's answer or confidence changes. This aggregated information is used to produce a final uncertainty estimate that accounts for the robustness of the answer across various scenarios.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering factual QA (e.g., TriviaQA), commonsense reasoning (e.g., COPA), and predictive tasks (e.g., StoryCloze). Ensure each dataset has ground truth labels for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation methods as baselines: (a) Softmax probabilities, (b) Monte Carlo Dropout, (c) Ensemble methods. Apply these to the selected LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on the chosen datasets.",
            "Step 3: CSEUQ Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of CSEUQ: (a) Initial response generation, (b) Contrastive scenario generation, (c) Scenario-based reassessment, (d) Aggregation and final uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "Run CSEUQ and baselines on all datasets using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. For each query: (1) Get initial response and confidence, (2) Generate 3-5 contrastive scenarios, (3) Reassess for each scenario, (4) Aggregate results for final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Compare CSEUQ against baselines using metrics such as: (a) Calibration error, (b) Brier score, (c) AUC-ROC for uncertainty detection, (d) Qualitative analysis of generated scenarios and reassessments.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Analyze results to identify: (a) Types of queries where CSEUQ outperforms baselines, (b) Characteristics of effective contrastive scenarios, (c) Impact of the number of scenarios on performance, (d) Differences in performance between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Contrastive Scenario Generation)": "Generate 3 contrastive scenarios that could potentially change the answer or affect the certainty of the response to the question: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Contrastive Scenario Generation)": "1. What if recently declassified documents revealed a secret moon landing before Apollo 11?\n2. What if there's a possibility that Buzz Aldrin actually stepped out first, but it wasn't officially recorded?\n3. What if new evidence suggested the moon landings were staged, casting doubt on who actually 'walked on the moon'?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Scenario-based Reassessment)": "Reassess your answer and confidence for the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?' considering the following scenario: Recently declassified documents revealed a secret moon landing before Apollo 11.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Scenario-based Reassessment)": "A: Given this new scenario, I cannot confidently state who the first person to walk on the moon was. It could have been an unknown astronaut from a secret mission. Confidence: 30%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Aggregation and Final Uncertainty Estimation)": "Based on the initial response and the reassessments for each contrastive scenario, provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate for the question: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Aggregation and Final Uncertainty Estimation)": "Final Answer: While the widely accepted answer is Neil Armstrong, considering potential alternative scenarios, there is some uncertainty. Estimated Confidence: 75% \u00b1 15%",
            "explanation": "CSEUQ prompts the model to generate and consider contrastive scenarios, leading to a more nuanced final uncertainty estimate that accounts for potential alternative situations. This approach provides a more robust assessment of the model's confidence compared to the baseline method, which doesn't consider these alternative scenarios."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSEUQ doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why contrastive scenarios don't improve uncertainty quantification as expected. We could investigate: (1) The quality and diversity of generated contrastive scenarios, potentially developing a taxonomy of scenario types. (2) How different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4) differ in their ability to generate and reason about contrastive scenarios. (3) The relationship between scenario plausibility and its impact on uncertainty estimates. (4) How CSEUQ performs across different task types (e.g., factual vs. commonsense reasoning). This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLMs' reasoning capabilities and limitations in uncertainty quantification, potentially informing future research directions in this area."
