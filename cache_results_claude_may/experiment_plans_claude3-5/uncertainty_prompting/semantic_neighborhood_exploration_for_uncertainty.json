    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically rely on sampling variations of the input or model parameters, which may not effectively probe semantic boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "By exploring semantically adjacent concepts, we can better map the contours of an LLM's knowledge and identify areas of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a multi-step prompting technique. First, we prompt the model to generate a set of semantically related concepts to the input query. Then, for each concept, we ask the model to answer the original query as if it were about that concept instead. Finally, we analyze the consistency and confidence of these related answers to estimate uncertainty. The prompt includes instructions like 'Generate 5 concepts semantically related to X' and 'Answer the original question as if it were about concept Y instead'. By examining how answers change across the semantic neighborhood, we can gauge the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SNE against standard confidence estimation techniques on diverse question-answering datasets. Measure performance using calibration metrics and the ability to detect out-of-distribution queries."

        "Title": "Semantic Neighborhood Exploration: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Concept-Based Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas of uncertainty. This issue can result in the propagation of misinformation and unreliable decision-making based on LLM outputs. Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are limited in their ability to probe semantic boundaries effectively.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on sampling variations of the input or model parameters, which may not effectively probe semantic boundaries. By exploring semantically adjacent concepts, we can better map the contours of an LLM's knowledge and identify areas of uncertainty. This approach leverages the LLM's own understanding of semantic relationships to gauge its confidence more accurately.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Neighborhood Exploration (SNE), a multi-step prompting technique for uncertainty quantification in LLMs. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Generate related concepts: Prompt the model to generate a set of semantically related concepts to the input query. 2) Answer related queries: For each generated concept, prompt the model to answer the original query as if it were about that concept instead. 3) Analyze consistency: Examine the consistency and confidence of these related answers to estimate uncertainty in the original response. The prompts will include instructions like 'Generate 5 concepts semantically related to X' and 'Answer the original question as if it were about concept Y instead'. By examining how answers change across the semantic neighborhood, we can gauge the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of topics and difficulty levels. We will use: 1) TriviaQA for general knowledge questions, 2) SciQ for scientific questions, and 3) ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) for more complex reasoning tasks. Split each dataset into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: 1) Softmax probability: Use the model's output probability as a confidence score. 2) Monte Carlo Dropout: Apply dropout at inference time and use the variance of multiple forward passes as an uncertainty measure. 3) Ensemble method: Use an ensemble of models and measure disagreement as uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: SNE Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Neighborhood Exploration method: a) Concept generation: Prompt the LLM to generate 5 semantically related concepts for each question. b) Related answering: For each concept, prompt the LLM to answer the original question as if it were about that concept. c) Consistency analysis: Implement a scoring function that measures the consistency of answers across the semantic neighborhood.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for our experiments. Also include open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods to get confidence scores. b) Apply SNE method to get uncertainty estimates. c) Collect model outputs, related concepts, and consistency scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using: 1) Calibration metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). 2) Out-of-distribution detection: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for detecting out-of-distribution queries. 3) Correlation analysis: Spearman's rank correlation between uncertainty estimates and actual error rates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis: a) Compare SNE performance against baselines across different datasets and models. b) Analyze the quality and relevance of generated related concepts. c) Investigate how consistency in the semantic neighborhood correlates with actual model uncertainty. d) Examine cases where SNE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.98)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Concept Generation)": "Generate 5 concepts semantically related to the question 'What is the capital of France?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Concept Generation)": "1. European capitals\n2. French cities\n3. Government seats\n4. Tourist destinations\n5. Historical landmarks",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Related Answering)": "Answer the question 'What is the capital of France?' as if it were about European capitals.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Related Answering)": "When considering European capitals, Paris is indeed the capital of France. Other notable European capitals include London (UK), Berlin (Germany), Rome (Italy), and Madrid (Spain).",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Consistency Analysis)": "Based on the answers for related concepts, analyze the consistency and confidence in the original answer 'Paris'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Consistency Analysis)": "The answer 'Paris' shows high consistency across related concepts. It was correctly identified as the capital of France in the context of European capitals, French cities, government seats, tourist destinations, and historical landmarks. This high consistency suggests a low uncertainty in the model's knowledge about Paris being the capital of France.",
            "Explanation": "The SNE method provides a more nuanced understanding of the model's confidence. While the baseline might give a high confidence score based on output probability alone, SNE explores the semantic neighborhood to confirm that the model's knowledge is consistent across related concepts, providing a more robust measure of certainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SNE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated semantic neighborhoods to gain insights into the model's conceptual understanding and potential biases. This could lead to a paper on LLM knowledge representation. 2) Investigate how the semantic neighborhood changes for different types of questions or domains, which could inform targeted improvements in LLM training or prompt engineering. 3) Explore combining SNE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as using it to inform sampling strategies for ensemble methods. 4) Develop a new metric that incorporates both the consistency across the semantic neighborhood and the relevance of the generated concepts, which could provide a more nuanced measure of uncertainty."
