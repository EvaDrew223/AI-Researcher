        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty on few-shot learning tasks, leading to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution examples.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically involve fine-tuning on large calibration datasets or using complex ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how humans calibrate their confidence when learning new tasks with limited examples, we propose a method that leverages the model's own uncertainty estimates to adaptively adjust its few-shot learning process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Few-Shot Learning (CCFSL), a novel prompting technique that interleaves confidence estimation with few-shot learning. The process involves: 1) Presenting the model with a few examples of the task. 2) Asking the model to solve a new instance while providing a confidence estimate. 3) Prompting the model to reflect on its confidence, explaining why it might be over or underconfident. 4) Using this reflection to adjust the few-shot examples, either by adding more diverse examples if underconfident, or by emphasizing key features if overconfident. 5) Repeating steps 2-4 iteratively, gradually refining the model's calibration on the task.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCFSL against standard few-shot learning and existing calibration methods on a range of tasks, including out-of-distribution generalization. Measure both task performance and calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE)."

        "Title": "Confidence-Calibrated Few-Shot Learning: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty on few-shot learning tasks, leading to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution examples. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where model reliability and trustworthiness are crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improve model calibration typically involve fine-tuning on large calibration datasets or using complex ensemble methods, which can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to new tasks. Inspired by how humans calibrate their confidence when learning new tasks with limited examples, we propose a method that leverages the model's own uncertainty estimates to adaptively adjust its few-shot learning process. This approach aims to improve calibration without the need for extensive additional training or complex architectures.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Calibrated Few-Shot Learning (CCFSL), a novel prompting technique that interleaves confidence estimation with few-shot learning. The process involves five key steps: 1) Presenting the model with a few examples of the task. 2) Asking the model to solve a new instance while providing a confidence estimate. 3) Prompting the model to reflect on its confidence, explaining why it might be over or underconfident. 4) Using this reflection to adjust the few-shot examples, either by adding more diverse examples if underconfident, or by emphasizing key features if overconfident. 5) Repeating steps 2-4 iteratively, gradually refining the model's calibration on the task.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) SNLI for natural language inference, 2) ANLI for adversarial natural language inference, and 3) a subset of MMLU for multi-task evaluation. For each dataset, create a few-shot learning setup with 5 examples per class.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard few-shot prompting, b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and c) Calibrated few-shot learning using temperature scaling. For each baseline, use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to generate predictions and confidence scores for the test set.",
            "Step 3: CCFSL Implementation": "Implement the CCFSL method using the following steps: a) Create an initial prompt with 5 few-shot examples. b) For each test instance, generate a prediction and confidence score. c) Prompt the model to reflect on its confidence. d) Based on the reflection, adjust the few-shot examples. e) Repeat steps b-d for 3 iterations or until confidence stabilizes.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "Calculate the following metrics for both baselines and CCFSL: a) Accuracy, b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), c) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), d) Brier Score, and e) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC).",
            "Step 5: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components: a) Vary the number of iterations in CCFSL. b) Compare performance with and without the reflection step. c) Analyze the effect of different prompting strategies for the reflection step.",
            "Step 6: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Evaluation": "Test the models on out-of-distribution examples by using a different dataset (e.g., RTE for NLI tasks) to assess how well the calibration generalizes to unseen data distributions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform a qualitative analysis of the model's reflections and example adjustments to gain insights into the calibration process. Visualize the changes in confidence estimates across iterations using reliability diagrams."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Task: Determine if the second sentence (hypothesis) is entailed by, neutral to, or contradicts the first sentence (premise).\n\nExamples:\nPremise: A soccer game with multiple males playing.\nHypothesis: Some men are playing a sport.\nLabel: Entailment\n\nPremise: A smiling costumed woman is holding an umbrella.\nHypothesis: A happy woman in a fairy costume holds an umbrella.\nLabel: Neutral\n\nPremise: A woman with a green headscarf, blue shirt and a very big grin.\nHypothesis: The woman is young.\nLabel: Neutral\n\nPremise: An older man with a hearing aid is smiling.\nHypothesis: A man is wearing an earpiece.\nLabel: Contradiction\n\nPremise: A man in a blue shirt standing in a room with a counter and a cash register.\nHypothesis: The man works as a cashier.\nLabel: Neutral\n\nNow, classify the following:\nPremise: Two women are embracing while holding to go packages.\nHypothesis: The women are hugging goodbye.\nLabel:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Label: Neutral\nConfidence: 0.8",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Prediction)": "[Same as Baseline Prompt Input]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Prediction)": "Label: Neutral\nConfidence: 0.8",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Reflection)": "You predicted 'Neutral' with a confidence of 0.8. Reflect on why you might be over or underconfident in this prediction. Consider what information is missing or ambiguous in the premise or hypothesis.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Step 2: Reflection)": "I might be slightly overconfident in this prediction for the following reasons:\n1. The premise doesn't specify the context of the embrace, so it could be a greeting or a goodbye.\n2. The presence of 'to go packages' suggests they might be parting, but it's not conclusive.\n3. The hypothesis adds information about 'goodbye' that isn't explicitly stated in the premise.\n4. There could be cultural or contextual cues I'm missing that might influence the interpretation.\n\nA more appropriate confidence level might be around 0.7, acknowledging the ambiguity in the scenario.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Adjusted Few-Shot Examples)": "[Include the original few-shot examples, but add one more example that highlights ambiguity:]\nPremise: Two friends are sitting at a table with coffee cups.\nHypothesis: The friends are having their weekly meetup.\nLabel: Neutral\n\n[Then proceed with the test case as before]",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Step 3: Final Prediction)": "Label: Neutral\nConfidence: 0.7",
            "explanation": "The CCFSL method allows the model to reflect on its initial confidence, recognizing potential sources of ambiguity. This leads to a more calibrated confidence score in the final prediction, which better reflects the uncertainty in the task."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCFSL method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can explore several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the reflection step in detail to understand if the model is generating meaningful insights about its confidence. If not, we might need to refine the prompting strategy for reflection, possibly by providing more structured guidance or examples of good reflections. Second, we could investigate whether the method is more effective for certain types of tasks or examples, which could lead to a hybrid approach combining CCFSL with other calibration methods. Additionally, we could explore using the reflections to train a separate calibration model, turning the project into a novel two-stage calibration approach. Finally, if the iterative nature of CCFSL proves challenging, we could simplify the method to a single-step reflection and adjustment, focusing on making that step as effective as possible."
