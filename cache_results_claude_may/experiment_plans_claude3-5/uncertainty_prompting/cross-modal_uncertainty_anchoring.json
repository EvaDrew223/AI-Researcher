    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to ground their uncertainty estimates in concrete, real-world concepts, leading to abstract or poorly calibrated confidence assessments.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods focus solely on text-based inputs and outputs for uncertainty quantification.",
        "Motivation": "By anchoring uncertainty estimates to concrete visual or auditory concepts, we can leverage the LLM's multimodal knowledge to provide more intuitive and well-calibrated confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Cross-Modal Uncertainty Anchoring (CMUA), a technique that maps text-based uncertainty estimates to concrete multimodal anchors. For a given response, we prompt the LLM to not only provide a numerical confidence score but also to describe a corresponding visual or auditory scene that represents that level of certainty. For example, 'I'm as confident in this answer as I am that [description of a clear sunny day].' We then use these descriptions to create a standardized set of multimodal anchors across a range of confidence levels. In subsequent uses, the LLM is prompted to relate its uncertainty to these established anchors, providing a more grounded and consistent basis for confidence estimation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CMUA against text-only confidence estimation methods on a range of tasks, including visual question answering and audio-based fact verification. Assess both calibration accuracy and human interpretability of the confidence estimates."

        "Title": "Cross-Modal Uncertainty Anchoring: Grounding Language Model Confidence in Multimodal Concepts",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide well-calibrated confidence estimates, particularly when their uncertainty is not grounded in concrete, real-world concepts. This leads to abstract or poorly calibrated confidence assessments, which can be misleading or difficult for users to interpret.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs primarily focus on text-based inputs and outputs, neglecting the potential of multimodal knowledge to provide more intuitive and well-calibrated confidence assessments. By anchoring uncertainty estimates to concrete visual or auditory concepts, we can leverage the LLM's multimodal knowledge to provide more grounded and interpretable confidence assessments. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we often relate our level of certainty to familiar sensory experiences.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Cross-Modal Uncertainty Anchoring (CMUA), a technique that maps text-based uncertainty estimates to concrete multimodal anchors. The method consists of two main phases: 1) Anchor Generation: We prompt the LLM to generate a set of standardized multimodal anchors across a range of confidence levels. For example, 'I'm as confident in this answer as I am that [description of a clear sunny day].' 2) Confidence Estimation: For subsequent uses, we prompt the LLM to relate its uncertainty to these established anchors, providing a more grounded and consistent basis for confidence estimation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for our experiments: 1) Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset, 2) AudioSet for audio-based fact verification, and 3) TruthfulQA for general knowledge questions. These datasets cover a range of modalities and task types.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence estimation: Prompt the LLM to provide a numerical confidence score (0-100%) along with its answer. 2) Verbal uncertainty estimation: Prompt the LLM to express its uncertainty using verbal phrases (e.g., 'very confident', 'somewhat uncertain').",
            "Step 3: CMUA Anchor Generation": "Prompt GPT-4 to generate a set of 10 standardized multimodal anchors across a range of confidence levels (0% to 100% in 10% increments). For each level, generate both visual and auditory anchors. Example prompt: 'Generate a description of a visual scene that represents a 70% confidence level.' Store these anchors for use in the next step.",
            "Step 4: CMUA Implementation": "Implement the CMUA method using the following steps: a) For a given question, prompt the LLM to provide an answer. b) Prompt the LLM to estimate its confidence by relating it to the pre-generated multimodal anchors. c) Extract a numerical confidence score based on the chosen anchor.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 for our main experiments, as it has demonstrated strong multimodal understanding capabilities. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method (baselines and CMUA), we will evaluate: 1) Calibration error: using Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). 2) Accuracy: compare model performance across different confidence levels. 3) Human interpretability: conduct a small-scale human evaluation (n=50) to assess the interpretability of CMUA confidence estimates compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of calibration across methods and datasets. 2) Analysis of how CMUA performance varies across different types of questions and modalities. 3) Qualitative analysis of the generated multimodal anchors and their effectiveness in grounding uncertainty."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "Q: What color is the sky on a clear day? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Estimation)": "A: The sky is blue on a clear day. Confidence: 95%",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Verbal Uncertainty Estimation)": "Q: What color is the sky on a clear day? Please provide your answer and express your level of certainty verbally.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Verbal Uncertainty Estimation)": "A: The sky is blue on a clear day. I am very confident in this answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CMUA; Step 1: Answer Generation)": "Q: What color is the sky on a clear day?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CMUA; Step 1: Answer Generation)": "A: The sky is blue on a clear day.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CMUA; Step 2: Confidence Estimation)": "Given your answer 'The sky is blue on a clear day', please estimate your confidence by selecting the most appropriate multimodal anchor from the following list: [List of pre-generated anchors]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CMUA; Step 2: Confidence Estimation)": "I would relate my confidence in this answer to the following anchor: 'I'm as confident in this answer as I am that I can hear the distinct sound of waves crashing on a beach.' This corresponds to a 90% confidence level.",
            "Explanation": "CMUA provides a more intuitive and grounded way of expressing confidence compared to abstract numerical scores or vague verbal expressions. It leverages concrete sensory experiences to make the confidence estimation more relatable and potentially more accurately calibrated."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CMUA does not show significant improvements over baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and diversity of generated multimodal anchors to ensure they cover a wide range of confidence levels and are easily distinguishable. 2) Analyzing cases where CMUA performs worse than baselines to identify potential biases or limitations in the approach. 3) Experimenting with different prompting strategies for anchor generation and confidence estimation. 4) Investigating whether certain types of questions or modalities benefit more from CMUA than others. Based on these analyses, we could refine the CMUA method, perhaps by incorporating a hybrid approach that combines numerical scores with multimodal anchors, or by developing a more sophisticated anchor selection process. Additionally, we could explore how CMUA performs on more complex reasoning tasks, where grounding uncertainty in concrete concepts might be particularly beneficial."
