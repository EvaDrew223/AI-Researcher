    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Static prompting methods for uncertainty estimation often fail to adapt to the diverse range of queries and contexts encountered in real-world applications.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use fixed prompting strategies or limited adaptation based on predefined rules.",
        "Motivation": "An adaptive system that can evolve its own prompting strategy could potentially provide more accurate and context-appropriate uncertainty estimates across a wide range of scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a meta-learning approach for evolving uncertainty estimation prompts. The system consists of two main components: 1) A prompt generator that creates candidate uncertainty estimation prompts, and 2) An evaluator that assesses the quality of these prompts. The process begins with an initial set of prompts. For each new query, the system generates multiple candidate prompts, applies them to estimate uncertainty, and evaluates their performance. Based on this evaluation, the prompt generator is updated to produce more effective prompts in future iterations. The prompts themselves are represented as structured templates with learnable components, allowing for open-ended evolution of the prompting strategy.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the system across a diverse range of tasks and domains, comparing it against static prompting methods and simpler adaptive techniques. Assess both the final uncertainty estimates and the quality of the evolved prompts using a combination of quantitative metrics (calibration, selective prediction performance) and qualitative analysis by human experts. Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of the meta-learning system."

        "Title": "Adaptive Meta-Learning for Evolving Uncertainty Estimation Prompts in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Static prompting methods for uncertainty estimation often fail to adapt to the diverse range of queries and contexts encountered in real-world applications, leading to inconsistent or unreliable uncertainty estimates across different scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically use fixed prompting strategies or limited adaptation based on predefined rules, which may not generalize well across diverse tasks and domains. An adaptive system that can evolve its own prompting strategy could potentially provide more accurate and context-appropriate uncertainty estimates across a wide range of scenarios. By leveraging meta-learning techniques, we can create a system that learns to generate effective prompts for uncertainty estimation, adapting to different types of queries and contexts over time.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a meta-learning approach for evolving uncertainty estimation prompts.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Collect a diverse set of tasks and domains for evaluation. Use existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, MMLU, and AmbigQA. Create a held-out test set for final evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Initial Prompt Set": "Design an initial set of uncertainty estimation prompts based on existing literature and best practices. Example prompts include: 'On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your answer?', 'What are the potential sources of uncertainty in your response?', 'Can you provide a 90% confidence interval for your answer?'",
            "Step 3: Prompt Generator Implementation": "Implement the prompt generator as a sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., T5) that takes as input a task description and outputs a candidate prompt. Fine-tune this model on a dataset of task-prompt pairs.",
            "Step 4: Evaluator Implementation": "Implement the evaluator as a regression model that takes as input the task, generated prompt, and model response, and outputs a quality score. Train this model on a dataset of human-annotated prompt quality scores.",
            "Step 5: Meta-Learning Loop": "For each training iteration: a) Sample a batch of tasks, b) Generate candidate prompts using the prompt generator, c) Apply these prompts to the LLM and collect responses, d) Evaluate the quality of the prompts using the evaluator, e) Update the prompt generator based on the evaluation scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the evolved prompting strategy on the held-out test set. Compare against baselines including static prompting methods and simpler adaptive techniques. Use metrics such as calibration error, selective prediction performance, and human evaluation of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of the meta-learning system. Analyze the evolution of prompts over time and identify common patterns or strategies that emerge."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and your confidence level on a scale of 1-10.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence level: 10/10.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? [UNCERTAINTY_PROMPT]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Here's my uncertainty assessment:\n1. Confidence level: 9/10\n2. Potential sources of uncertainty:\n   - My knowledge could be outdated if there have been recent changes.\n   - There might be confusion with cultural or economic capitals.\n3. Probability estimate: I'm 99% certain that Paris is the correct answer.\n4. Alternative possibilities: While highly unlikely, other cities that could potentially be considered 'capital' in different contexts might include Marseille (economic importance) or Versailles (historical significance).",
            "Explanation": "The evolved prompt elicits a more nuanced and informative uncertainty estimate, considering multiple aspects of uncertainty and providing context-specific information."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed meta-learning approach doesn't yield significant improvements, we can pivot to an analysis paper focusing on the patterns and characteristics of effective uncertainty estimation prompts across different tasks and domains. We could investigate why certain prompts work better for specific types of queries or subject areas, and use this information to develop a taxonomy of uncertainty estimation strategies. Additionally, we could explore the limitations of current LLMs in providing reliable uncertainty estimates and propose potential architectural changes or training strategies to address these limitations. This analysis could provide valuable insights for future research in improving LLM uncertainty estimation capabilities."
