    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs struggle to accurately assess their own confidence, often being overconfident in incorrect answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include self-consistency checks, calibration via supervised fine-tuning, and ensemble methods.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often engage in internal debate when unsure, weighing evidence for and against different positions. By simulating this process in LLMs, we may achieve better-calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce 'Meta-Cognitive Debate' (MCD), a multi-turn prompting strategy. Given a query, we first prompt the LLM to generate an initial answer and confidence score. We then prompt it to take on the role of a skeptic, challenging its own answer and confidence. This is followed by a rebuttal from the original perspective. This debate continues for several turns, with the model updating its confidence score after each turn. The final confidence score is derived from the trajectory of these updates. We also incorporate a 'debate summarization' step, where the model is asked to synthesize the key points from the debate, potentially leading to a refined answer and confidence estimate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare MCD against baseline methods on diverse tasks including factual QA (e.g., TruthfulQA), reasoning tasks (e.g., MMLU), and open-ended generation. Evaluate using calibration metrics like ECE and Brier score. Analyze the quality and coherence of the generated debates through human evaluation."

        "Title": "Meta-Cognitive Debate: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models through Self-Debate",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own confidence, frequently exhibiting overconfidence in incorrect answers. This misalignment between confidence and accuracy can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, limiting the practical applications of LLMs in critical decision-making scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence calibration, such as self-consistency checks, supervised fine-tuning, and ensemble approaches, have shown promise but still leave room for improvement. Human experts often engage in internal debate when uncertain, weighing evidence for and against different positions. By simulating this process in LLMs, we aim to achieve better-calibrated confidence estimates. The Meta-Cognitive Debate (MCD) approach leverages the LLM's ability to generate diverse perspectives and critically evaluate its own reasoning, potentially leading to more nuanced and accurate confidence assessments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Cognitive Debate (MCD), a multi-turn prompting strategy that simulates internal debate within the LLM. The process involves the following steps: 1) Initial response generation with a confidence score. 2) Skeptic perspective generation, challenging the initial answer and confidence. 3) Rebuttal from the original perspective. 4) Alternating debate turns (skeptic and rebuttal) for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence. 5) Confidence score updates after each turn. 6) Final debate summarization and refined answer generation. The trajectory of confidence updates throughout the debate process is used to derive the final calibrated confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering factual QA (e.g., TruthfulQA), reasoning tasks (e.g., MMLU), and open-ended generation. Ensure a mix of questions with varying difficulty levels and domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement and evaluate baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting, 2) Self-consistency, 3) Calibrated few-shot prompting. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs for these baselines.",
            "Step 3: MCD Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of the MCD process: a) Initial response prompt: \"Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]\". b) Skeptic prompt: \"You are a skeptical expert. Challenge the following answer and confidence score: [INITIAL_RESPONSE]\". c) Rebuttal prompt: \"Defend your original answer against the following criticism: [SKEPTIC_RESPONSE]\". d) Summarization prompt: \"Summarize the key points from the following debate and provide a refined answer with an updated confidence score: [FULL_DEBATE]\".",
            "Step 4: MCD Implementation": "Implement the MCD process using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs. Set a maximum of 5 debate turns. Track confidence scores after each turn.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate MCD against baselines using: 1) Accuracy metrics (e.g., exact match, F1 score), 2) Calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, Brier score), 3) Human evaluation of debate quality and coherence (sample 100 examples for expert review).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Analyze results focusing on: 1) Performance across different task types, 2) Confidence trajectory during debates, 3) Impact of debate length on calibration, 4) Qualitative assessment of debate content and summarizations.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies: 1) Vary the number of debate turns, 2) Remove the summarization step, 3) Use a fixed skeptic/defender instead of alternating roles.",
            "Step 8: Comparison with Existing Methods": "Compare MCD results with published results from other confidence calibration methods (e.g., calibrated few-shot prompting, ensemble methods) on overlapping datasets."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
                "Explanation": "Direct prompting often leads to high confidence even for simple questions, potentially masking areas of uncertainty."
            },
            "MCD Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Initial Response": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%",
                "Skeptic Response": "While Paris is indeed the capital of France, a 95% confidence seems too high. There could be nuances or historical contexts we're not considering. For instance, during certain periods in history, other cities like Vichy served as de facto capitals. Additionally, some might argue that the EU's influence makes Brussels a sort of 'capital' for EU matters. A more calibrated confidence might be around 85-90%.",
                "Rebuttal": "You raise valid points about historical contexts and the role of the EU. However, Paris has been the official capital of France since 987 AD, with only brief interruptions. It's the seat of government, and internationally recognized as the capital. The examples you mentioned (Vichy, Brussels) are specific to certain contexts and don't change Paris's status as the capital. I agree that 95% might be slightly high, and would adjust to 90% confidence.",
                "Final Response": "A: The capital of France is Paris. While there have been brief historical periods where other cities like Vichy served as de facto capitals, and Brussels plays a significant role in EU governance, Paris has been the official and internationally recognized capital of France since 987 AD, with only minor interruptions. Confidence: 90%",
                "Explanation": "The MCD process led to a more nuanced response and a slightly lower, potentially better-calibrated confidence score. It acknowledged historical complexities and potential alternative viewpoints, demonstrating the model's ability to consider and integrate multiple perspectives."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If MCD doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why self-debate doesn't lead to better calibration in LLMs. We would focus on: 1) Analyzing the content of debates to identify patterns in how LLMs argue against themselves. 2) Investigating whether the model's ability to generate counterarguments correlates with its actual uncertainty. 3) Comparing the debate content across different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning) to understand where self-debate is more or less effective. 4) Exploring alternative ways to leverage the debate content, such as using it to train a separate calibration model. Additionally, we could experiment with prompting strategies that more explicitly ask the model to reason about its own knowledge limitations, or incorporate external knowledge sources into the debate process to see if this improves calibration."
