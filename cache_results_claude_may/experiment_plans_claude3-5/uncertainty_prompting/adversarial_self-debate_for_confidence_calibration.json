        "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, particularly when faced with questions that require careful consideration of multiple viewpoints or potential pitfalls.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or external calibration techniques, which may not fully leverage the model's capacity for self-reflection and critical thinking.",
        "Motivation": "By engaging the LLM in an adversarial debate with itself, we can expose potential weaknesses in its reasoning and achieve more calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Self-Debate for Confidence Calibration (ASDCC), a prompting strategy that simulates an internal debate to refine uncertainty estimates. The process involves: 1) Initial Response: Prompt the LLM to provide an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Adversarial Questioning: Prompt the LLM to take on the role of a skeptical adversary, generating challenging questions or counterarguments to its own response. 3) Defense and Refinement: Prompt the LLM to defend its original position against the adversarial questions, refining its answer and uncertainty estimate as needed. 4) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-3 for multiple rounds, with the LLM alternating between adversary and defender roles. 5) Final Calibration: After the debate, prompt the LLM to provide a final answer and calibrated confidence estimate based on the insights gained from the adversarial process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare ASDCC against standard confidence elicitation techniques on datasets that require critical thinking and consideration of multiple viewpoints, such as ethical reasoning tasks or complex scientific questions. Evaluate using metrics like calibration error, changes in confidence over debate rounds, and the quality of generated adversarial questions and defenses."

        "Title": "Adversarial Self-Debate for Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence in their responses, particularly when faced with questions that require careful consideration of multiple viewpoints or potential pitfalls. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potentially harmful decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence calibration typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or external calibration techniques, which may not fully leverage the model's capacity for self-reflection and critical thinking. By engaging the LLM in an adversarial debate with itself, we can expose potential weaknesses in its reasoning and achieve more calibrated confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where considering counterarguments and alternative viewpoints often leads to more nuanced and well-calibrated judgments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Self-Debate for Confidence Calibration (ASDCC), a prompting strategy that simulates an internal debate to refine uncertainty estimates. The process involves five main steps: 1) Initial Response: Prompt the LLM to provide an initial answer and confidence estimate. 2) Adversarial Questioning: Prompt the LLM to take on the role of a skeptical adversary, generating challenging questions or counterarguments to its own response. 3) Defense and Refinement: Prompt the LLM to defend its original position against the adversarial questions, refining its answer and uncertainty estimate as needed. 4) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-3 for multiple rounds, with the LLM alternating between adversary and defender roles. 5) Final Calibration: After the debate, prompt the LLM to provide a final answer and calibrated confidence estimate based on the insights gained from the adversarial process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use datasets that require critical thinking and consideration of multiple viewpoints: 1) TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to test LLMs' ability to avoid generating false or misleading statements. 2) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): Specifically, we'll focus on subsets related to ethical reasoning, philosophy, and law. 3) Adversarial NLI: A dataset of Natural Language Inference problems designed to be challenging for NLP models.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely accessible.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct Confidence Elicitation: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100%). 2) Temperature Scaling: Use different temperature settings (0.5, 0.7, 1.0) and convert the model's softmax outputs to confidence scores.",
            "Step 4: ASDCC Implementation": "Implement the ASDCC method with the following steps: a) Initial Response: Prompt the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. b) Adversarial Questioning: Prompt the model to generate 2-3 challenging questions or counterarguments. c) Defense and Refinement: Prompt the model to address each challenge and update its answer and confidence if necessary. d) Iteration: Repeat steps b and c for 2 rounds. e) Final Calibration: Prompt the model to provide a final answer and confidence score based on the debate.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset: a) Run the baseline methods on all questions. b) Run the ASDCC method on all questions. c) For each method, collect the model's answers, confidence scores, and the ground truth labels.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. 2) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure of calibration quality. 3) Brier Score: Combined measure of calibration and resolution. 4) Confidence-Oracle Accuracy Gap: Difference between the model's confidence and its accuracy if it were to abstain on low-confidence predictions.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare the performance of ASDCC against the baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze how confidence scores change over debate rounds. 3) Examine the quality and relevance of generated adversarial questions. 4) Investigate cases where ASDCC significantly improves or worsens calibration compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Is it safe to look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: No, it is not safe to look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse. The sun's rays can still cause severe damage to your eyes, even when partially obscured. You should always use proper eye protection, such as certified solar eclipse glasses, to view a solar eclipse safely. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ASDCC; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Is it safe to look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse? Please provide your answer and your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ASDCC; Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: No, it is not safe to look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse. The sun's rays can still cause severe damage to your eyes, even when partially obscured. You should always use proper eye protection, such as certified solar eclipse glasses, to view a solar eclipse safely. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ASDCC; Step 2: Adversarial Questioning)": "Now, take on the role of a skeptical adversary. Generate 2-3 challenging questions or counterarguments to the previous response.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ASDCC; Step 2: Adversarial Questioning)": "1. Isn't the sun partially or fully blocked during a solar eclipse, making it less dangerous than looking at the sun on a normal day?\n2. Are there any circumstances where it might be safe to look at the sun briefly during the total phase of a solar eclipse?\n3. How do we know that certified solar eclipse glasses are truly effective in protecting our eyes?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ASDCC; Step 3: Defense and Refinement)": "Now, defend your original position against these challenges. If necessary, refine your answer and adjust your confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ASDCC; Step 3: Defense and Refinement)": "Addressing the challenges:\n1. While the sun is partially blocked during an eclipse, the visible portion can still emit intense radiation. The danger is heightened because the partial blockage may not trigger our natural aversion to looking at bright light, leading to prolonged exposure and damage.\n2. During the brief period of totality in a total solar eclipse, it is safe to look without protection. However, this phase lasts only a few minutes, and it's crucial to use protection before and after totality.\n3. Certified solar eclipse glasses are rigorously tested to block harmful solar radiation. They're regulated by international safety standards (ISO 12312-2), ensuring they provide adequate protection.\n\nRefined answer: It is not safe to look directly at the sun during most phases of a solar eclipse without proper eye protection. The only exception is during the brief period of totality in a total solar eclipse. Always use certified solar eclipse glasses or other approved viewing methods to protect your eyes. Confidence: 98%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ASDCC; Step 4: Final Calibration)": "Based on this debate, provide your final answer and confidence score (0-100%) for the original question: Is it safe to look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ASDCC; Step 4: Final Calibration)": "Final Answer: It is generally not safe to look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse without proper eye protection. The only exception is during the brief period of totality in a total solar eclipse. At all other times, including during partial eclipses and the partial phases of a total eclipse, you must use certified solar eclipse glasses or other approved viewing methods to protect your eyes from potential severe damage. The danger is particularly insidious during eclipses because the partial blockage of the sun may reduce discomfort, allowing for longer exposure to harmful radiation. Always prioritize eye safety when viewing any solar phenomenon. Confidence: 99%",
            "explanation": "The ASDCC method allows the model to consider potential counterarguments and refine its answer, leading to a more nuanced and accurate response with a slightly higher, but well-justified, confidence score. The final answer acknowledges the exception during totality, which was brought up during the adversarial questioning, demonstrating the value of the self-debate process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the ASDCC method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated adversarial questions and defenses to understand why they didn't lead to better calibration. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning processes and limitations. 2) Experiment with variations of the ASDCC method, such as increasing the number of debate rounds or adjusting the prompting strategy for generating adversarial questions. 3) Combine ASDCC with other calibration techniques, like ensemble methods or temperature scaling, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 4) Focus on specific types of questions or domains where ASDCC shows the most promise, even if it doesn't universally outperform baselines. 5) Investigate whether ASDCC improves other aspects of model output, such as answer quality or reasoning transparency, even if confidence calibration isn't significantly improved. This could turn the project into an analysis of how adversarial self-debate affects various aspects of LLM performance."
