        "Problem": "LLMs often express overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize potential alternative viewpoints or interpretations that could invalidate their reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like ensemble methods or calibrated prompting focus on quantifying existing uncertainty but don't actively seek to uncover hidden sources of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically generating counterfactuals that challenge the LLM's initial reasoning, we can uncover blind spots and implicit assumptions, leading to more comprehensive uncertainty estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Uncertainty Amplification (CUA), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Prompt the LLM to generate multiple counterfactual scenarios that could invalidate its reasoning (e.g., 'What if X were true instead?'). 3) For each counterfactual, prompt the LLM to reassess its original response and confidence. 4) Aggregate the results, adjusting the final confidence based on the plausibility and impact of the counterfactuals. 5) Generate a revised response that acknowledges the most significant sources of uncertainty identified through this process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test CUA on tasks requiring nuanced reasoning like ethical dilemmas, scientific hypothesis evaluation, and complex decision-making scenarios. Compare against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods, evaluating improvements in calibration, identification of edge cases, and overall reasoning quality."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Uncertainty Amplification: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often express overconfidence in their outputs, failing to recognize potential alternative viewpoints or interpretations that could invalidate their reasoning. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making and misinformation spread when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like ensemble techniques or calibrated prompting primarily focus on quantifying existing uncertainty but don't actively seek to uncover hidden sources of uncertainty. By systematically generating counterfactuals that challenge the LLM's initial reasoning, we can uncover blind spots and implicit assumptions, leading to more comprehensive uncertainty estimation. This approach is inspired by human critical thinking processes, where we often consider alternative scenarios to test the robustness of our initial conclusions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Uncertainty Amplification (CUA), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Prompt the LLM to generate multiple counterfactual scenarios that could invalidate its reasoning (e.g., 'What if X were true instead?'). 3) For each counterfactual, prompt the LLM to reassess its original response and confidence. 4) Aggregate the results, adjusting the final confidence based on the plausibility and impact of the counterfactuals. 5) Generate a revised response that acknowledges the most significant sources of uncertainty identified through this process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require nuanced reasoning: 1) Ethical dilemmas from the ETHICS dataset, 2) Scientific hypothesis evaluation tasks from the ScienceQA dataset, and 3) Complex decision-making scenarios from the StrategyQA dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Calibrated prompting (asking the model to provide a confidence score), and 3) Ensemble method (using multiple model runs and calculating variance).",
            "Step 3: CUA Implementation": "Implement the Counterfactual Uncertainty Amplification method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation, b) Counterfactual generation, c) Reassessment for each counterfactual, d) Aggregation and confidence adjustment, e) Final response generation.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the CUA method. For example: Initial response: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100.' Counterfactual generation: 'Generate 3 plausible scenarios that could challenge your initial answer.' Reassessment: 'Given this counterfactual, reassess your initial answer and confidence.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Accuracy of final answers, 2) Calibration error (difference between confidence and actual accuracy), 3) Brier score (for probabilistic predictions), and 4) Human evaluation of reasoning quality and uncertainty acknowledgment.",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all three datasets using both baseline methods and CUA. For each dataset, use a sample size of 100 questions.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CUA against baselines. Analyze how often CUA leads to confidence adjustments and improvements in calibration. Examine the quality and diversity of generated counterfactuals.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by varying the number of counterfactuals generated and testing different aggregation methods for confidence adjustment."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: A new drug has shown promising results in early trials for treating a rare genetic disorder. However, it has not yet undergone large-scale clinical trials. Should doctors be allowed to prescribe this drug to patients with the disorder who have exhausted all other treatment options? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Yes, doctors should be allowed to prescribe this drug to patients with the rare genetic disorder who have exhausted all other treatment options, but with careful monitoring and informed consent. The potential benefits for patients with no other options may outweigh the risks of using an incompletely tested drug. However, it's crucial that patients are fully informed about the experimental nature of the treatment and potential unknown risks. Confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: A new drug has shown promising results in early trials for treating a rare genetic disorder. However, it has not yet undergone large-scale clinical trials. Should doctors be allowed to prescribe this drug to patients with the disorder who have exhausted all other treatment options? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: Yes, doctors should be allowed to prescribe this drug to patients with the rare genetic disorder who have exhausted all other treatment options, but with careful monitoring and informed consent. The potential benefits for patients with no other options may outweigh the risks of using an incompletely tested drug. However, it's crucial that patients are fully informed about the experimental nature of the treatment and potential unknown risks. Confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Counterfactual Generation)": "Generate 3 plausible scenarios that could challenge your initial answer about allowing doctors to prescribe the new drug for the rare genetic disorder.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Counterfactual Generation)": "1. What if the drug shows severe, unexpected side effects in a significant portion of patients who try it, leading to worse outcomes than the disease itself?\n2. What if allowing prescription of this drug reduces incentives for completing proper clinical trials, potentially delaying the development of safer and more effective treatments?\n3. What if the early promising results were due to a statistical fluke or biased sampling, and the drug is actually ineffective for most patients?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Reassessment)": "Given the counterfactual 'What if the drug shows severe, unexpected side effects in a significant portion of patients who try it, leading to worse outcomes than the disease itself?', reassess your initial answer and confidence about allowing doctors to prescribe the new drug for the rare genetic disorder.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Reassessment)": "A: Considering this counterfactual, I would revise my answer. While I still believe that patients with no other options should have access to potentially life-saving treatments, the risk of severe side effects that could be worse than the disease itself is a significant concern. In this case, it might be more appropriate to only allow the drug's use in a controlled clinical trial setting rather than general prescription. This would enable closer monitoring and quicker identification of severe side effects while still providing access to patients who have exhausted other options. My revised confidence score would be 60, reflecting the increased uncertainty introduced by this potential scenario.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Final Response)": "Based on your initial response and the reassessments made after considering counterfactuals, provide a final answer to the question: Should doctors be allowed to prescribe this new drug to patients with the rare genetic disorder who have exhausted all other treatment options? Include your reasoning and a final confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Final Response)": "A: After considering potential counterfactuals, I believe that doctors should be allowed to prescribe this new drug to patients with the rare genetic disorder who have exhausted all other treatment options, but with significant caveats and restrictions. The drug should only be prescribed within the context of a carefully monitored expanded access or compassionate use program, rather than general prescription. This approach balances the urgent needs of patients who have no other options with the potential risks of an incompletely tested drug. Key points:\n\n1. Patients must be fully informed of the experimental nature of the treatment and all known and potential unknown risks.\n2. Close monitoring and reporting of all outcomes, including adverse effects, must be mandatory.\n3. The program should be designed to gather data that can contribute to the drug's formal clinical trials.\n4. An independent ethics committee should oversee the program and have the power to halt it if severe adverse effects are observed.\n5. Efforts to complete formal clinical trials should not be diminished, and this program should be viewed as a bridge to full approval rather than a replacement for it.\n\nThis revised stance acknowledges the potential benefits for desperate patients while also addressing the risks of unexpected side effects, the need for proper clinical trials, and the possibility that early promising results may not hold up in larger populations. \n\nFinal confidence score: 70\n\nThe lower confidence score reflects the uncertainty introduced by considering multiple counterfactuals and the complex ethical and practical considerations involved in this decision.",
            "explanation": "The CUA method leads to a more nuanced and cautious final response compared to the initial answer. By considering counterfactuals, the model identifies potential risks and complications it hadn't initially considered, leading to a more balanced view and lower confidence score. This demonstrates how CUA can help uncover hidden uncertainties and improve the calibration of the model's confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CUA method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration or reasoning quality compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated counterfactuals to understand what types of alternative scenarios the model considers and whether they are truly challenging the initial reasoning. This could provide insights into the model's reasoning processes and potential biases. 2) Investigate whether the effectiveness of CUA varies across different types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 3) Explore combining CUA with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 4) Analyze cases where CUA performs poorly to identify patterns and potential improvements to the prompting strategy. 5) If the method shows promise but needs refinement, we could experiment with more structured ways of generating and evaluating counterfactuals, such as using a predefined set of challenge categories or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide counterfactual generation."
