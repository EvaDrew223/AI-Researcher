    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex, multi-faceted queries where uncertainty may vary across different aspects of the response.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches focus on generating a single scalar confidence score or using techniques like ensemble disagreement.",
        "Motivation": "By deconstructing a query into its semantic components, we can potentially obtain a more nuanced and accurate picture of model uncertainty across different aspects of the response.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Deconstruction Prompting (SDP), a multi-step process where the model: 1) Deconstructs the query into semantic components (e.g., for 'What was the economic impact of the French Revolution?', components might include 'short-term effects', 'long-term effects', 'impact on different social classes', etc.). 2) For each component, generates a response and an associated confidence score. 3) Provides reasoning for each confidence score. 4) Synthesizes a final response, weighting information based on component-level confidence. 5) Generates an overall confidence score and explanation based on the component-level uncertainties. This approach allows for a more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SDP against baseline methods (e.g., direct prompting, ensemble methods) on a range of complex queries in history, science, and current events. Evaluate using metrics for calibration, resolution, and interpretability of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Semantic Deconstruction Prompting for Granular Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty, especially for complex, multi-faceted queries where uncertainty may vary across different aspects of the response. This limitation hinders the reliability and interpretability of LLM outputs in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often produce a single scalar confidence score or rely on ensemble disagreement, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties present in complex queries. By deconstructing a query into its semantic components, we can potentially obtain a more granular and accurate picture of model uncertainty across different aspects of the response. This approach aligns with how humans often break down complex problems and assess their confidence in different parts of their reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Deconstruction Prompting (SDP), a multi-step process where the model: 1) Deconstructs the query into semantic components. 2) For each component, generates a response and an associated confidence score. 3) Provides reasoning for each confidence score. 4) Synthesizes a final response, weighting information based on component-level confidence. 5) Generates an overall confidence score and explanation based on the component-level uncertainties. This approach allows for a more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets covering different domains: 1) TruthfulQA for factual knowledge, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets provide a diverse range of complex, multi-faceted queries.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: a) Direct prompting with a request for a confidence score, b) Ensemble method using 5 different prompts and measuring disagreement.",
            "Step 3: SDP Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Deconstruction Prompting method with the following steps: a) Query deconstruction, b) Component-wise response and confidence generation, c) Confidence reasoning, d) Response synthesis, e) Overall confidence generation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Accuracy of final responses, b) Calibration error (comparing confidence scores to actual correctness), c) Spearman correlation between confidence scores and correctness, d) Human evaluation of interpretability and granularity of uncertainty quantification.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods, b) Run SDP method, c) Collect results including intermediate outputs for analysis.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare SDP against baselines on all metrics. Analyze component-level confidences and their correlation with final output correctness. Examine cases where SDP outperforms or underperforms baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What was the economic impact of the French Revolution? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The economic impact of the French Revolution was significant and multifaceted:\n\n1. Redistribution of wealth: The revolution led to the confiscation and sale of Church and noble lands, which redistributed wealth to some extent.\n\n2. Financial crisis: The revolution initially worsened France's financial crisis due to war expenses and economic disruption.\n\n3. Abolition of feudalism: This led to more economic freedom for peasants and workers.\n\n4. Currency devaluation: The introduction of assignats (paper money) led to high inflation.\n\n5. Industrial growth: In the long term, the revolution paved the way for industrial growth by removing old economic restrictions.\n\n6. Changes in taxation: The tax system was reformed, aiming for more equality, though implementation was challenging.\n\nConfidence score: 85\n\nWhile I'm confident in the general points, specific details and the exact magnitude of each impact could benefit from further verification.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDP; Step 1: Query Deconstruction)": "Deconstruct the following query into its key semantic components: \"What was the economic impact of the French Revolution?\"",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDP; Step 1: Query Deconstruction)": "1. Short-term economic effects\n2. Long-term economic effects\n3. Impact on different social classes\n4. Changes in economic policies and institutions\n5. Effects on France's international economic position",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDP; Step 2: Component-wise Response and Confidence)": "For each semantic component of the query \"What was the economic impact of the French Revolution?\", provide a brief response and a confidence score (0-100). Components:\n1. Short-term economic effects\n2. Long-term economic effects\n3. Impact on different social classes\n4. Changes in economic policies and institutions\n5. Effects on France's international economic position",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDP; Step 2: Component-wise Response and Confidence)": "1. Short-term economic effects:\nResponse: Immediate financial crisis, hyperinflation due to assignats, disruption of trade and production.\nConfidence: 90\n\n2. Long-term economic effects:\nResponse: Modernization of the economy, growth of industrial sector, more efficient agricultural practices.\nConfidence: 85\n\n3. Impact on different social classes:\nResponse: Redistribution of wealth, improved economic mobility for middle class, initial hardship for lower classes.\nConfidence: 80\n\n4. Changes in economic policies and institutions:\nResponse: Abolition of feudalism, new property rights, creation of the Bank of France, metric system introduction.\nConfidence: 95\n\n5. Effects on France's international economic position:\nResponse: Initial weakening due to war and instability, long-term strengthening as a major industrial power.\nConfidence: 75",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDP; Step 3: Confidence Reasoning)": "For each component and its confidence score, provide a brief explanation for why you assigned that particular confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDP; Step 3: Confidence Reasoning)": "1. Short-term economic effects (90): High confidence due to well-documented immediate impacts in historical records and economic data from the period.\n\n2. Long-term economic effects (85): Slightly lower confidence as long-term effects involve more variables and interpretations, but still well-supported by historical economic trends.\n\n3. Impact on different social classes (80): Lower confidence due to variations in experiences across regions and individuals, making generalizations more challenging.\n\n4. Changes in economic policies and institutions (95): Very high confidence as these changes are clearly documented in official records and laws from the revolutionary period.\n\n5. Effects on France's international economic position (75): Lowest confidence due to the complexity of international relations and economic interactions, as well as varying interpretations by historians.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDP; Step 4: Response Synthesis)": "Based on the component-wise responses and confidence scores, synthesize a comprehensive answer to the question \"What was the economic impact of the French Revolution?\". Weight the information based on the confidence scores.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDP; Step 4: Response Synthesis)": "The economic impact of the French Revolution was profound and multifaceted. In the short term, France experienced a severe financial crisis, characterized by hyperinflation due to the introduction of assignats (paper money) and disruption of trade and production. These immediate effects are well-documented and had a significant impact on the country's economy.\n\nThe revolution brought about crucial changes in economic policies and institutions. The abolition of feudalism, establishment of new property rights, creation of the Bank of France, and introduction of the metric system were key developments that reshaped the economic landscape. These changes are very well-supported by historical evidence and played a pivotal role in France's economic transformation.\n\nIn the long term, the revolution led to the modernization of the French economy, fostering growth in the industrial sector and promoting more efficient agricultural practices. While the exact magnitude of these effects may vary, the overall trend towards economic modernization is clear.\n\nThe impact on different social classes was significant but varied. There was a redistribution of wealth, particularly through the confiscation and sale of Church and noble lands. The middle class saw improved economic mobility, while the lower classes initially faced hardships before experiencing long-term benefits. However, it's important to note that experiences varied across regions and individuals.\n\nRegarding France's international economic position, the initial period saw a weakening due to war and instability. However, in the long run, France emerged as a major industrial power, though the exact trajectory and comparison with other nations during this period are subject to ongoing historical debate.\n\nOverall, while some aspects of the economic impact are clearer than others, the French Revolution undeniably brought about substantial and lasting changes to France's economic structure and policies, setting the stage for its economic development in the 19th century and beyond.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SDP; Step 5: Overall Confidence Generation)": "Based on the component-wise confidence scores and the synthesized response, provide an overall confidence score (0-100) for the answer to \"What was the economic impact of the French Revolution?\" Explain your reasoning for this overall score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SDP; Step 5: Overall Confidence Generation)": "Overall Confidence Score: 85\n\nReasoning: The overall confidence score of 85 reflects a weighted average of the component confidence scores, taking into account the relative importance and certainty of each aspect.\n\nWe have very high confidence (95) in the changes to economic policies and institutions, which form a crucial part of the revolution's impact. The short-term effects are also well-documented (90 confidence), providing a solid foundation for our understanding of the immediate economic consequences.\n\nThe long-term effects and the impact on different social classes, while slightly less certain (85 and 80 confidence respectively), are still well-supported by historical evidence and economic data. These components significantly shape our overall understanding of the revolution's economic impact.\n\nThe lowest confidence (75) is in the effects on France's international economic position, which involves complex international dynamics and varying historical interpretations. However, this aspect, while important, doesn't overshadow the more certain domestic impacts in our overall assessment.\n\nThe synthesized response effectively integrates these components, acknowledging areas of higher and lower certainty. It provides a comprehensive view of the economic impact while appropriately qualifying statements where uncertainty is higher.\n\nTherefore, the overall confidence score of 85 represents a high level of certainty in the main aspects of the economic impact of the French Revolution, while acknowledging that some nuances and long-term international comparisons may benefit from further investigation or may be subject to ongoing historical debate.",
            "explanation": "The SDP method provides a more nuanced and granular assessment of the model's confidence across different aspects of the complex query. It allows for a weighted synthesis of information based on component-level confidences and provides a detailed reasoning for the overall confidence score. This approach offers more transparency and interpretability compared to the baseline method, which only provides a single confidence score without detailed justification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SDP method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why SDP fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in uncertainty quantification. This could involve examining cases where component-level confidences are inconsistent with final answer accuracy, or where the model struggles to effectively deconstruct queries. Second, we could explore variations of the SDP method, such as iterative refinement of component-level responses or incorporating external knowledge sources for verification. Third, we could shift focus to developing a hybrid approach that combines SDP with other methods like ensemble disagreement or calibration techniques. Finally, we could expand our analysis to include a wider range of query types and domains to identify specific areas where SDP is most effective, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the method in practice."
