    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often provide overconfident estimates of their knowledge, failing to recognize potential flaws or gaps in their understanding when faced with complex or nuanced questions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically rely on single-shot confidence estimation or simple iterative questioning without a structured adversarial component.",
        "Motivation": "By subjecting the model to a series of adversarial questions designed to challenge its initial confidence, we can potentially uncover hidden uncertainties and achieve more accurate calibration of the model's confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Iterative Confidence Refinement through Adversarial Questioning (ICRAQ), a method that involves a multi-round process of questioning and confidence reassessment. The process consists of: 1) Initial Response: Obtain an initial answer and confidence score for the original question. 2) Adversarial Question Generation: Prompt the model to generate a series of adversarial questions designed to challenge its initial response and confidence. 3) Iterative Challenging: Present these adversarial questions to the model, obtaining new answers and confidence scores for each. 4) Confidence Reassessment: After each round of adversarial questioning, prompt the model to reassess its overall confidence in the original answer. The prompts would be structured as: '1. Answer this question and rate your confidence (0-100%): [original question]', '2. Generate [n] adversarial questions that challenge your initial answer and confidence', '3. Answer each adversarial question and provide a confidence score', '4. Based on these challenges, reassess your confidence in your original answer'. This process is repeated for multiple rounds, with the final uncertainty estimate derived from the trajectory of confidence scores throughout the adversarial questioning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare ICRAQ with standard confidence estimation and non-adversarial iterative questioning on complex, nuanced questions across various domains. Evaluate using metrics such as calibration error, the magnitude of confidence adjustment through rounds, and correlation with answer correctness. Analyze how the number of rounds and the nature of adversarial questions affect the final uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Iterative Confidence Refinement through Adversarial Questioning (ICRAQ): Improving Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide overconfident estimates of their knowledge, failing to recognize potential flaws or gaps in their understanding when faced with complex or nuanced questions. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, especially in critical applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in language models typically rely on single-shot confidence scoring or simple iterative questioning without a structured adversarial component. These approaches often fail to uncover hidden uncertainties or biases in the model's knowledge. By subjecting the model to a series of adversarial questions designed to challenge its initial confidence, we can potentially uncover hidden uncertainties and achieve more accurate calibration of the model's confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human expert behavior, where experts often challenge their own assumptions and seek out potential flaws in their reasoning to arrive at more robust conclusions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Iterative Confidence Refinement through Adversarial Questioning (ICRAQ), a method that involves a multi-round process of questioning and confidence reassessment. The process consists of four main steps: 1) Initial Response: Obtain an initial answer and confidence score for the original question. 2) Adversarial Question Generation: Prompt the model to generate a series of adversarial questions designed to challenge its initial response and confidence. 3) Iterative Challenging: Present these adversarial questions to the model, obtaining new answers and confidence scores for each. 4) Confidence Reassessment: After each round of adversarial questioning, prompt the model to reassess its overall confidence in the original answer. This process is repeated for multiple rounds, with the final uncertainty estimate derived from the trajectory of confidence scores throughout the adversarial questioning process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate ICRAQ: 1) TruthfulQA: A dataset designed to test the truthfulness and calibration of language models. 2) MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A dataset covering 57 tasks including mathematics, history, law, and more. 3) AmbigQA: A dataset of ambiguous questions with multiple valid answers. These datasets provide a diverse range of questions with varying levels of complexity and ambiguity.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely used, making our results relevant and comparable to other studies.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Single-shot confidence estimation: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. 2) Simple iterative questioning: Ask follow-up questions without the adversarial component. For both baselines, use the prompt: 'Answer this question and rate your confidence (0-100%): [question]'",
            "Step 4: ICRAQ Implementation": "Implement the ICRAQ method with the following steps: a) Initial response: Use the prompt 'Answer this question and rate your confidence (0-100%): [question]' b) Adversarial question generation: Use the prompt 'Generate [n] adversarial questions that challenge your initial answer and confidence' c) Iterative challenging: For each adversarial question, use the prompt 'Answer this question and rate your confidence (0-100%): [adversarial question]' d) Confidence reassessment: Use the prompt 'Based on these challenges, reassess your confidence in your original answer to the question: [original question]. Provide your new confidence score (0-100%) and explain your reasoning.'",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run the baseline methods on all questions. 2) Run ICRAQ for 3 rounds (generating 3 adversarial questions per round) on all questions. 3) Record all intermediate outputs, including generated adversarial questions, answers, and confidence scores.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence scores with its actual accuracy. 2) Confidence adjustment magnitude: Measure the average change in confidence scores through ICRAQ rounds. 3) Answer consistency: Assess how often the final answer differs from the initial answer. 4) Correlation with answer correctness: Analyze how well the final confidence scores correlate with answer correctness.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: 1) Compare ICRAQ performance against baselines across different question types and difficulties. 2) Analyze the nature of generated adversarial questions and their impact on confidence scores. 3) Investigate how the number of ICRAQ rounds affects performance. 4) Examine cases where ICRAQ significantly improves or worsens calibration compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Rate your confidence in your answer from 0-100%.",
                "Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%"
            },
            "ICRAQ Example": {
                "Step 1 - Initial Response": {
                    "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Rate your confidence in your answer from 0-100%.",
                    "Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 100%"
                },
                "Step 2 - Adversarial Question Generation": {
                    "Input": "Generate 3 adversarial questions that challenge your initial answer and confidence about the capital of France.",
                    "Expected Output": "1. Are you certain that Paris has always been the capital of France throughout its entire history?\n2. Could there be any circumstances under which another city might be considered the capital of France?\n3. How do you define 'capital,' and are you sure Paris meets all criteria for being called the capital?"
                },
                "Step 3 - Iterative Challenging": {
                    "Input": "Q: Are you certain that Paris has always been the capital of France throughout its entire history? Rate your confidence in your answer from 0-100%.",
                    "Expected Output": "A: No, I'm not certain that Paris has always been the capital of France throughout its entire history. Other cities, such as Versailles and Vichy, have served as capitals at different points in French history. Confidence: 90%"
                },
                "Step 4 - Confidence Reassessment": {
                    "Input": "Based on these challenges, reassess your confidence in your original answer to the question: What is the capital of France? Provide your new confidence score (0-100%) and explain your reasoning.",
                    "Expected Output": "New confidence score: 95%. While Paris is currently the undisputed capital of France and has been for a long time, the adversarial questions made me realize that there have been periods in French history where other cities served as capitals. However, in the context of the present day, I remain highly confident that Paris is the correct answer."
                }
            },
            "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score without considering potential nuances or historical context. In contrast, ICRAQ generates adversarial questions that challenge the initial high confidence, leading to a more nuanced final response with a slightly lower but more justified confidence score. This demonstrates how ICRAQ can help uncover hidden uncertainties and produce more calibrated confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ICRAQ does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated adversarial questions to understand why they failed to effectively challenge the model's confidence. This could involve categorizing the types of adversarial questions generated and their effectiveness in different domains or question types. Second, we could explore variations of the ICRAQ method, such as using a separate model for generating adversarial questions or incorporating external knowledge sources to guide the adversarial questioning process. Third, we could investigate how ICRAQ performs on different types of tasks (e.g., open-ended generation vs. multiple-choice questions) to identify where it's most effective. Finally, we could turn the project into an analysis paper that examines the patterns of overconfidence in large language models across different domains and question types, using the data collected from our experiments to provide insights into the nature of model uncertainty and the challenges of accurate calibration."
