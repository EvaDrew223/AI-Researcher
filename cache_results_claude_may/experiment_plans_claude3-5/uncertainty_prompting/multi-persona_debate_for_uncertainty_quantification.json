    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty in complex problems, especially when multiple valid perspectives exist.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically rely on a single model perspective, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By simulating a debate between multiple personas with different expertise and viewpoints, we can more comprehensively explore sources of uncertainty and arrive at a better-calibrated confidence estimate.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Persona Debate for Uncertainty Quantification (MPDUQ), a prompting technique that orchestrates a simulated debate to assess confidence. Given a query, the model is first prompted to generate several distinct personas, each with a unique background and perspective relevant to the question. The model then simulates a debate among these personas, with each presenting arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals. Throughout the debate, each persona provides and updates their confidence estimates. The model is then prompted to synthesize these diverse viewpoints, identifying key sources of agreement and disagreement. Finally, the model generates a comprehensive uncertainty assessment, taking into account the strength and diversity of arguments presented in the debate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MPDUQ against single-perspective confidence estimation techniques on complex, multi-faceted problems such as policy analysis, scientific hypothesis evaluation, and ethical dilemmas. We'll assess both the calibration of the final confidence estimates and the quality and diversity of the simulated debate. Human experts will also evaluate the comprehensiveness of the uncertainty assessment produced by this method."

        "Title": "Multi-Persona Debate for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the full spectrum of uncertainty in complex problems, especially when multiple valid perspectives exist. This leads to overconfident or poorly calibrated predictions in scenarios where genuine ambiguity or multiple valid interpretations are present.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on a single model perspective, potentially missing important sources of uncertainty. By simulating a debate between multiple personas with different expertise and viewpoints, we can more comprehensively explore sources of uncertainty and arrive at a better-calibrated confidence estimate. This approach is inspired by human decision-making processes in complex scenarios, where experts from various fields might be consulted to gain a more holistic understanding of the problem and associated uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Persona Debate for Uncertainty Quantification (MPDUQ), a prompting technique that orchestrates a simulated debate to assess confidence. Given a query, the model is first prompted to generate several distinct personas, each with a unique background and perspective relevant to the question. The model then simulates a debate among these personas, with each presenting arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals. Throughout the debate, each persona provides and updates their confidence estimates. The model is then prompted to synthesize these diverse viewpoints, identifying key sources of agreement and disagreement. Finally, the model generates a comprehensive uncertainty assessment, taking into account the strength and diversity of arguments presented in the debate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover complex, multi-faceted problems: (1) Policy Analysis: A curated set of 100 policy questions from think tanks and government reports. (2) Scientific Hypothesis Evaluation: 100 scientific claims from recent publications in interdisciplinary fields. (3) Ethical Dilemmas: 100 scenarios from philosophy and applied ethics literature.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. (2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Ask the model to think step-by-step before providing an answer and confidence score. (3) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses using different prompts and aggregate the results.",
            "Step 3: MPDUQ Implementation": "Implement the MPDUQ method with the following sub-steps: (1) Persona Generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 distinct personas relevant to the question. (2) Debate Simulation: Orchestrate a multi-turn debate between the personas, with each presenting arguments and updating their stance. (3) Confidence Estimation: Prompt each persona to provide and update their confidence estimates throughout the debate. (4) Synthesis: Prompt the model to synthesize the debate and generate a final uncertainty assessment.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the datasets: (1) Apply all baseline methods and record their outputs and confidence scores. (2) Apply the MPDUQ method and record the full debate transcript, individual persona confidence estimates, and final synthesized uncertainty assessment. (3) Use GPT-4 as the primary model for all experiments, with GPT-3.5 as a secondary model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "(1) Calibration: Compare the calibration of confidence estimates from baselines and MPDUQ using reliability diagrams and expected calibration error (ECE). (2) Uncertainty Quality: Have human experts rate the comprehensiveness and quality of uncertainty assessments on a subset of 50 questions from each dataset. (3) Debate Quality: Evaluate the quality and diversity of arguments in the simulated debates using automated metrics (e.g., semantic similarity) and human evaluation.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "(1) Compare MPDUQ performance against baselines across different problem types. (2) Analyze how the number of personas and debate turns affects the final uncertainty assessment. (3) Investigate cases where MPDUQ significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. (4) Examine the relationship between debate quality and final uncertainty assessment quality."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What would be the potential economic impacts of implementing a universal basic income (UBI) in the United States? Provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: Implementing a universal basic income (UBI) in the United States would likely have significant economic impacts, including:\n1. Reduced poverty and income inequality\n2. Increased consumer spending and economic stimulus\n3. Potential inflation due to increased money supply\n4. Changes in labor market participation\n5. Increased government expenditure and potential tax increases\n\nConfidence Score: 80",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPDUQ; Step 1: Persona Generation)": "Generate 3-5 distinct personas with different backgrounds and perspectives relevant to discussing the economic impacts of implementing a universal basic income (UBI) in the United States.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPDUQ; Step 1: Persona Generation)": "1. Dr. Emily Chen: Progressive economist specializing in income inequality and social welfare programs\n2. Mark Thompson: Conservative think tank researcher focused on fiscal policy and government spending\n3. Sarah Rodriguez: Small business owner and entrepreneur\n4. Prof. James Wilson: Behavioral economist studying the effects of financial incentives on work and productivity",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPDUQ; Step 2: Debate Simulation)": "Simulate a debate between the generated personas on the potential economic impacts of implementing a UBI in the United States. Each persona should present arguments, respond to others, and update their stance over multiple turns.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPDUQ; Step 2: Debate Simulation)": "[Debate transcript with multiple turns, including arguments and counterarguments from each persona]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPDUQ; Step 3: Confidence Estimation)": "Based on the debate, have each persona provide their final confidence estimate (0-100) on their ability to accurately predict the economic impacts of UBI implementation.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPDUQ; Step 3: Confidence Estimation)": "Dr. Emily Chen: 75\nMark Thompson: 60\nSarah Rodriguez: 50\nProf. James Wilson: 65",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPDUQ; Step 4: Synthesis)": "Synthesize the debate and individual confidence estimates to provide a comprehensive uncertainty assessment on the potential economic impacts of implementing a UBI in the United States.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPDUQ; Step 4: Synthesis)": "Comprehensive Uncertainty Assessment:\nThe debate reveals significant uncertainty regarding the economic impacts of implementing a UBI in the United States. Key areas of uncertainty include:\n1. Long-term effects on labor market participation and productivity\n2. Magnitude of inflationary pressures\n3. Sustainability of funding mechanisms\n4. Interaction with existing welfare programs\n5. Variability of impacts across different economic sectors and demographics\n\nBased on the diverse perspectives presented and the range of confidence estimates (50-75), we can conclude that while some economic impacts of UBI are predictable, there remains substantial uncertainty about the overall effect. The average confidence score of 62.5 reflects this uncertainty, indicating that while experts can make informed predictions, the complexity of the issue and potential for unforeseen consequences make high confidence difficult to achieve.\n\nOverall Confidence Score: 63",
            "explanation": "The MPDUQ method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of uncertainty compared to the baseline method. By simulating a debate between multiple personas, it captures a wider range of perspectives and potential outcomes, leading to a more calibrated confidence estimate and a richer understanding of the sources of uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MPDUQ method does not significantly outperform baselines in terms of calibration or uncertainty quality, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated debates to identify patterns in argumentation and reasoning that could inform future prompting strategies. (2) Investigate how different persona compositions affect the final uncertainty assessment, potentially leading to insights on optimal expert selection for complex problems. (3) Explore a hybrid approach that combines MPDUQ with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as bootstrapping or Bayesian inference. (4) Develop a new metric for evaluating the 'completeness' of uncertainty assessments based on the diversity and depth of considerations raised in the debates. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different prompting strategies for uncertainty quantification."
