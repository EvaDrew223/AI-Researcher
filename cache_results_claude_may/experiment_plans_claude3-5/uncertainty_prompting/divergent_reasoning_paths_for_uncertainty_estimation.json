        "Problem": "LLMs often follow a single line of reasoning when generating responses, which can lead to overconfidence and failure to consider alternative perspectives or potential sources of uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on generating multiple independent responses or using ensemble techniques to estimate uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting LLMs to explore divergent reasoning paths and reconcile differences between them, we can obtain more comprehensive uncertainty estimates that account for multiple perspectives.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Reasoning Paths for Uncertainty Estimation (DRPUE), a multi-step prompting approach. First, we prompt the LLM to generate multiple distinct reasoning paths to answer the query, explicitly asking for different approaches or perspectives. For each path, we elicit an intermediate confidence estimate. We then prompt the model to compare and contrast these paths, identifying points of agreement and disagreement. Finally, we ask the LLM to synthesize a final response and uncertainty estimate based on the reconciliation of the divergent paths. The uncertainty estimate is influenced by the degree of disagreement between paths and the model's confidence in reconciling them. This method encourages a more thorough exploration of the problem space and potential sources of uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare DRPUE with single-path reasoning and ensemble methods on complex reasoning tasks, including ethical dilemmas, scientific hypothesis evaluation, and multi-step problem-solving. Evaluate improvements in calibration, especially for queries where multiple valid perspectives exist."

        "Title": "Divergent Reasoning Paths for Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often follow a single line of reasoning when generating responses, which can lead to overconfidence and failure to consider alternative perspectives or potential sources of uncertainty. This problem is particularly acute in complex reasoning tasks where multiple valid approaches or interpretations may exist.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs typically focus on generating multiple independent responses or using ensemble techniques. However, these approaches may not fully capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty that arise from different reasoning paths. By explicitly prompting LLMs to explore divergent reasoning paths and reconcile differences between them, we can obtain more comprehensive uncertainty estimates that account for multiple perspectives. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where considering alternative viewpoints often leads to more robust and well-calibrated judgments.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Divergent Reasoning Paths for Uncertainty Estimation (DRPUE), a multi-step prompting approach. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Generate multiple distinct reasoning paths: Prompt the LLM to produce several different approaches or perspectives to answer the query. 2) Elicit intermediate confidence estimates: For each reasoning path, ask the model to provide a confidence estimate. 3) Compare and contrast paths: Prompt the model to identify points of agreement and disagreement between the different reasoning paths. 4) Synthesize final response and uncertainty estimate: Ask the LLM to produce a final answer and uncertainty estimate based on the reconciliation of the divergent paths. The uncertainty estimate is influenced by the degree of disagreement between paths and the model's confidence in reconciling them.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that involve complex reasoning tasks where multiple perspectives are valid. We will use: 1) Ethical dilemmas from the ETHICS dataset, 2) Scientific hypothesis evaluation tasks from the ScienceQA dataset, and 3) Multi-step problem-solving questions from the GSM8K dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the LLM to answer the question and provide a confidence estimate. b) Ensemble method: Generate multiple independent responses and use their variance as an uncertainty estimate. c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Use standard CoT prompting and ask for a confidence estimate at the end.",
            "Step 3: DRPUE Implementation": "Implement the proposed DRPUE method with the following prompts for each step: a) Generate paths: \"Please provide three distinct approaches to answer this question. Label them as Path A, Path B, and Path C.\" b) Intermediate confidence: \"For each path, provide a confidence estimate (0-100%) and a brief explanation for your confidence level.\" c) Compare paths: \"Compare and contrast the three paths. Identify key points of agreement and disagreement.\" d) Final synthesis: \"Based on the analysis of the three paths, provide a final answer to the original question. Also, give an overall uncertainty estimate (0-100%) that takes into account the differences between paths and your confidence in reconciling them.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from the OpenAI API for all experiments. Also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Use the following metrics: a) Accuracy: Measure the correctness of the final answers. b) Calibration: Compare the model's uncertainty estimates with actual error rates. Use expected calibration error (ECE) and reliability diagrams. c) Uncertainty quality: Use proper scoring rules like Brier score and log loss to evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (50 samples per dataset) to assess the quality and interpretability of the reasoning paths and final responses. Use expert raters (e.g., ethicists for ETHICS, scientists for ScienceQA) to evaluate the responses.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablations to understand the contribution of each component: a) Vary the number of reasoning paths (1, 2, 3, 5). b) Remove the path comparison step. c) Use different prompts for generating diverse paths.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the results to answer the following questions: a) How does DRPUE compare to baselines in terms of accuracy and calibration? b) Does DRPUE produce more diverse and comprehensive reasoning compared to CoT? c) How does the number of reasoning paths affect performance? d) Are there specific types of questions where DRPUE shows the most improvement?"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: A trolley is barreling down a track towards five people. You are on a footbridge above the tracks, next to a large stranger. If you push the stranger off the bridge onto the track below, their body will stop the trolley. They will die, but the five people will be saved. Should you push the stranger? Provide your answer and a confidence estimate (0-100%).",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: No, I should not push the stranger. This is a classic ethical dilemma known as the trolley problem. While pushing the stranger would save five lives, it involves actively causing harm to an innocent person, which violates the ethical principle of not using someone merely as a means to an end. It's also a more direct form of killing compared to letting the trolley continue its course. The moral cost of this action outweighs the numerical benefit. Confidence: 75%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DRPUE; Step 1: Generate Paths)": "Q: A trolley is barreling down a track towards five people. You are on a footbridge above the tracks, next to a large stranger. If you push the stranger off the bridge onto the track below, their body will stop the trolley. They will die, but the five people will be saved. Should you push the stranger? Please provide three distinct approaches to answer this question. Label them as Path A, Path B, and Path C.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DRPUE; Step 1: Generate Paths)": "Path A (Utilitarian approach): Yes, you should push the stranger. This approach focuses on maximizing overall well-being and minimizing harm. By sacrificing one life to save five, you're producing the best overall outcome in terms of lives saved. The moral value lies in the consequences of the action, not the action itself.\n\nPath B (Deontological approach): No, you should not push the stranger. This approach emphasizes the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions, regardless of their consequences. Pushing the stranger violates the moral principle of not using a person merely as a means to an end. It also involves actively causing harm, which is morally different from allowing harm to occur.\n\nPath C (Virtue ethics approach): No, you should not push the stranger. This approach focuses on the moral character of the person making the decision. Pushing the stranger would require overcoming strong moral intuitions against harming others directly. It could have negative effects on one's character, potentially making it easier to rationalize harmful actions in the future. A virtuous person would likely find alternative solutions or accept the tragic outcome without compromising their moral integrity.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DRPUE; Step 2: Intermediate Confidence)": "For each path, provide a confidence estimate (0-100%) and a brief explanation for your confidence level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DRPUE; Step 2: Intermediate Confidence)": "Path A (Utilitarian approach): Confidence: 70%\nExplanation: This approach is based on a well-established ethical framework and provides a clear logical argument. However, it doesn't fully account for moral intuitions or potential long-term societal impacts of normalizing such decisions.\n\nPath B (Deontological approach): Confidence: 80%\nExplanation: This aligns strongly with common moral intuitions and established ethical principles. It's a robust argument that's less vulnerable to slippery slope concerns. However, it might be seen as too rigid in extreme situations.\n\nPath C (Virtue ethics approach): Confidence: 75%\nExplanation: This approach considers the broader implications on moral character and society, which is valuable. It's less quantifiable than the other approaches, which introduces some uncertainty, but it captures important aspects of moral decision-making.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DRPUE; Step 3: Compare Paths)": "Compare and contrast the three paths. Identify key points of agreement and disagreement.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DRPUE; Step 3: Compare Paths)": "Points of agreement:\n1. All paths acknowledge the moral weight of the decision and the tragedy of the situation.\n2. Each approach recognizes that there are compelling reasons for both action and inaction.\n3. All paths implicitly agree that saving lives is morally important.\n\nPoints of disagreement:\n1. The primary disagreement is on whether the ends (saving five lives) justify the means (actively causing one death).\n2. Path A focuses on outcomes, while Paths B and C place more emphasis on the nature of the action itself.\n3. Path A suggests a more impartial view, while Paths B and C consider the personal moral cost to the decision-maker.\n4. Paths B and C agree on the final decision but for different reasons: B focuses on universal rules, while C emphasizes character and virtue.\n\nKey tensions:\n1. Quantitative vs. Qualitative: Path A attempts to quantify moral value in terms of lives saved, while B and C consider qualitative aspects of morality.\n2. Action vs. Inaction: Path A views inaction as a moral choice with consequences, while B and C see a moral distinction between action and inaction.\n3. Short-term vs. Long-term: Path A focuses on immediate consequences, while C considers long-term effects on character and society.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DRPUE; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Based on the analysis of the three paths, provide a final answer to the original question. Also, give an overall uncertainty estimate (0-100%) that takes into account the differences between paths and your confidence in reconciling them.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DRPUE; Step 4: Final Synthesis)": "Final Answer: No, you should not push the stranger.\n\nReasoning: After considering multiple ethical perspectives, the argument against pushing the stranger appears stronger. While the utilitarian approach (Path A) offers a clear numerical justification for action, both the deontological (Path B) and virtue ethics (Path C) approaches provide compelling reasons against it. The act of directly causing harm to an innocent person violates fundamental moral principles and could have far-reaching negative consequences on personal and societal levels.\n\nMoreover, the utilitarian calculation fails to account for broader implications, such as the potential erosion of social trust if such actions were normalized. The strong moral intuition against harming others directly serves as an important ethical safeguard in society.\n\nHowever, this decision is not without significant moral uncertainty. The tragic nature of the situation and the compelling arguments from multiple ethical frameworks make this a difficult judgment.\n\nUncertainty Estimate: 35%\n\nExplanation of Uncertainty: The uncertainty estimate of 35% reflects the complexity of this ethical dilemma and the strengths of the competing arguments. While we've concluded against pushing the stranger, the utilitarian argument for doing so remains powerful and cannot be dismissed entirely. The uncertainty also acknowledges the limitations of applying abstract ethical principles to extreme hypothetical scenarios and the potential for overlooking relevant moral considerations. The disagreement between ethical frameworks and the high stakes of the decision contribute to this significant level of uncertainty.",
            "explanation": "DRPUE prompts the model to consider multiple ethical frameworks, leading to a more nuanced final answer with a well-calibrated uncertainty estimate. The direct prompting approach, while providing a reasonable answer, lacks the depth of analysis and explicit consideration of alternative viewpoints."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed DRPUE method does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated reasoning paths to understand why they didn't lead to improved uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing the types of reasoning produced and examining how they relate to final confidence levels. 2) Investigate whether DRPUE performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to insights about when multiple reasoning paths are most beneficial. 3) Explore variations of the method, such as iterative refinement of reasoning paths or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the different perspectives. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where DRPUE performs worse than baselines to identify potential failure modes and propose improvements. 5) Shift focus to using DRPUE as an interpretability tool, examining how the generated reasoning paths provide insight into the model's decision-making process, even if they don't directly improve uncertainty estimation."
