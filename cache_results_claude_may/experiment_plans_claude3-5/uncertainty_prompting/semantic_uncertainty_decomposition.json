    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide a single confidence score for their answers, which fails to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex questions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on producing a single confidence score or probability distribution over possible answers.",
        "Motivation": "Complex questions often involve multiple knowledge components and reasoning steps. By decomposing uncertainty at a semantic level, we can provide more informative and actionable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Decomposition (SUD), a prompting technique that breaks down a question into its core semantic components and assesses uncertainty for each. The process involves three steps: 1) Semantic Parsing: Prompt the model to identify key semantic elements of the question (e.g., entities, relations, temporal aspects). 2) Component-wise Confidence Estimation: For each semantic component, prompt the model to provide a confidence score and explanation. 3) Holistic Integration: Prompt the model to synthesize component-wise uncertainties into an overall confidence estimate, explaining how different components contribute. The prompt structure guides the model through this process: 'Decompose the question into key semantic components. For each component, provide a confidence score (0-100) and explanation. Then, synthesize these into an overall confidence estimate, explaining your reasoning.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SUD against standard confidence estimation methods on complex question-answering tasks, particularly those requiring multi-hop reasoning or diverse knowledge integration. Assess the quality of uncertainty decomposition through human evaluation and measure the correlation between component-wise and overall confidence scores with answer correctness."

        "Title": "Semantic Uncertainty Decomposition: Enhancing Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide a single confidence score for their answers, which fails to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex questions. This oversimplification can lead to overconfidence in incorrect answers or underconfidence in correct ones, potentially misleading users and limiting the models' practical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on producing a single confidence score or probability distribution over possible answers. However, complex questions often involve multiple knowledge components and reasoning steps. By decomposing uncertainty at a semantic level, we can provide more informative and actionable confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human expert reasoning, where confidence is often assessed for different aspects of a problem separately before forming an overall judgment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Uncertainty Decomposition (SUD), a prompting technique that breaks down a question into its core semantic components and assesses uncertainty for each.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset, which contains complex questions designed to assess the truthfulness and uncertainty of language models. This dataset is suitable for our task as it covers a wide range of topics and includes questions with varying levels of difficulty and uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. We will also use GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard confidence estimation: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and a single confidence score. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) confidence estimation: Use CoT prompting and ask for a final confidence score.",
            "Step 4: SUD Implementation": "Implement the Semantic Uncertainty Decomposition method using the following steps for each question: a) Semantic Parsing, b) Component-wise Confidence Estimation, c) Holistic Integration.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Answer Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. 2) Confidence Calibration Error: Measure of how well the confidence scores align with actual correctness. 3) Spearman Correlation: Between confidence scores and answer correctness. 4) Human Evaluation: Assess the quality and interpretability of the uncertainty decomposition.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset using both baseline methods and SUD. Collect results for each method, including answers, confidence scores, and intermediate outputs for SUD.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of SUD against the baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the quality of semantic decomposition and component-wise confidence estimation. Investigate cases where SUD performs particularly well or poorly compared to baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in SUD: 1) Remove semantic parsing step. 2) Remove component-wise confidence estimation. 3) Vary the number of semantic components identified."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in what year did this happen? Please provide your answer along with a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence Estimation)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon, and this happened in 1969. Confidence score: 95/100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Confidence Estimation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in what year did this happen? Please think through this step-by-step and provide your answer along with a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Confidence Estimation)": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. The Apollo 11 mission was the first manned mission to land on the moon.\n2. This mission took place in July 1969.\n3. The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins.\n4. Neil Armstrong was the first to step onto the lunar surface, followed by Buzz Aldrin.\n5. Armstrong's famous words were: 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'\n\nBased on these steps, I can confidently answer:\nNeil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon, and this happened in 1969.\n\nConfidence score: 98/100\n\nI'm very confident in this answer because it's a well-documented historical fact that I've encountered many times. The only slight uncertainty (preventing a 100/100 score) comes from the possibility of some extremely unlikely scenario where this widely accepted information could be incorrect.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUD; Step 1: Semantic Parsing)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in what year did this happen? Decompose this question into its key semantic components.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUD; Step 1: Semantic Parsing)": "The question can be decomposed into the following key semantic components:\n1. Identity: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\n2. Temporal: In what year did this event occur?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUD; Step 2: Component-wise Confidence Estimation)": "For each semantic component, provide a confidence score (0-100) and explanation:\n1. Identity: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\n2. Temporal: In what year did this event occur?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUD; Step 2: Component-wise Confidence Estimation)": "1. Identity: Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\nConfidence Score: 99/100\nExplanation: I'm extremely confident that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. This is a well-documented historical fact that has been consistently reported and verified across numerous reliable sources. The only reason for not giving a perfect 100 is the minute possibility of some unknown historical revision.\n\n2. Temporal: In what year did this event occur?\nConfidence Score: 98/100\nExplanation: I'm very confident that the moon landing occurred in 1969. This date is widely known and consistently reported in historical records. The slightly lower confidence compared to the identity is due to the possibility of minor confusion with the exact date (July 20, 1969) versus the year, but I'm still highly certain about the year 1969.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SUD; Step 3: Holistic Integration)": "Based on the component-wise confidence estimations, synthesize an overall confidence estimate for the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon, and in what year did this happen?' Explain your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SUD; Step 3: Holistic Integration)": "Overall Confidence Estimate: 98/100\n\nReasoning: The overall confidence is very high because both key components of the question - the identity of the first person to walk on the moon and the year it happened - have been assessed with high confidence (99/100 and 98/100 respectively). \n\nThe identity component has slightly higher confidence due to the iconic nature of Neil Armstrong's achievement, which is less likely to be misremembered or confused than a specific year. The temporal component, while still highly confident, introduces a slight additional uncertainty.\n\nBy synthesizing these two highly confident components, we arrive at an overall confidence of 98/100. This reflects that we are extremely confident in the complete answer (Neil Armstrong in 1969) while acknowledging the small possibility of error in either component.\n\nThis decomposition allows us to see that any potential uncertainty is more likely to be associated with the exact year rather than the person involved, which provides more nuanced and actionable information than a single confidence score alone.",
            "explanation": "The SUD method provides a more detailed and nuanced assessment of confidence compared to the baselines. It breaks down the question into semantic components, allowing for separate confidence estimations that can reveal which aspects of the answer might be more or less certain. The holistic integration then provides a well-reasoned overall confidence score, explaining how the component confidences contribute to the final estimate. This approach offers more transparency and interpretability in the confidence estimation process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SUD method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the semantic decompositions to understand if the model is consistently identifying relevant components. This could lead to insights about the model's understanding of question structure. 2) Investigate the relationship between component-wise confidences and overall confidence. Are there patterns in how the model integrates these scores? 3) Compare the explanations provided in SUD with those in CoT prompting. This could reveal differences in reasoning processes between the methods. 4) Examine cases where SUD performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the approach. 5) Explore variations of the SUD method, such as asking the model to generate its own verification questions for each component, or incorporating external knowledge sources for validation. These analyses could turn the project into an insightful study on how LLMs reason about their own uncertainty across different question components."
