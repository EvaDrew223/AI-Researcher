        "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often fail to account for the temporal consistency of model outputs, which can be a key indicator of true confidence.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches focus on single-time-point uncertainty estimates or use simple ensemble methods over multiple runs.",
        "Motivation": "By analyzing the consistency of model outputs over time and across slight variations in input, we can gain deeper insights into the model's true uncertainty and the stability of its knowledge.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Consistency Uncertainty Probing (TCUP), a method that assesses model uncertainty by probing the temporal stability of its outputs. TCUP works by repeatedly querying the model with slight variations of the same input over a series of time steps. These variations include minor paraphrasing, adding or removing context, and introducing controlled noise. TCUP then analyzes the consistency of the model's outputs across these temporal probes, using metrics such as output similarity, reasoning path stability, and confidence score variance. The final uncertainty estimate is derived from a combination of these temporal consistency metrics, weighted by their predictive power for model correctness.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TCUP against standard single-time-point uncertainty estimation methods on a range of tasks, including factual recall, reasoning, and generation. We'll measure improvements in calibration error, the ability to detect true knowledge gaps versus temporary lapses, and the correlation between temporal consistency and actual model performance."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Uncertainty Probing (TCUP): Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Output Stability",
        "Problem Statement": "Current uncertainty estimation methods for language models often fail to account for the temporal consistency of model outputs, which can be a key indicator of true confidence. This limitation leads to unreliable uncertainty estimates, potentially causing misplaced trust in model outputs in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on single-time-point uncertainty estimates or use simple ensemble methods over multiple runs, which may not capture the full spectrum of model uncertainty. By analyzing the consistency of model outputs over time and across slight variations in input, we can gain deeper insights into the model's true uncertainty and the stability of its knowledge. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where consistent responses across multiple attempts often indicate higher confidence and reliability.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Consistency Uncertainty Probing (TCUP), a method that assesses model uncertainty by probing the temporal stability of its outputs.

The final uncertainty estimate is derived from a combination of these temporal consistency metrics, weighted by their predictive power for model correctness.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets covering different types of tasks: (1) TriviaQA for factual recall, (2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and (3) CommonGen for text generation. For each dataset, randomly select 1000 examples for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation methods: (1) Softmax probability, (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, and (3) Ensemble of 5 model runs. For each method, generate uncertainty scores for all examples in the evaluation sets.",
            "Step 3: TCUP Implementation": "For each example in the evaluation sets: (a) Generate 5 input variations using techniques like synonym replacement, adding/removing context, and introducing minor typos. (b) Query the model with each variation 3 times, with a 1-second delay between queries, resulting in 15 total outputs per example. (c) Compute similarity scores between outputs using BERT-Score. (d) Extract confidence scores from each output (e.g., using calibrated softmax probabilities). (e) Analyze the stability of reasoning paths across outputs (for applicable tasks) using similarity metrics on intermediate steps. (f) Combine these metrics into a final TCUP uncertainty score using a weighted average, with weights determined through a small-scale optimization on a held-out set.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection and API Setup": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments. Set up API calls with appropriate rate limiting and error handling.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method (baselines and TCUP): (a) Compute the correlation between uncertainty estimates and model correctness. (b) Calculate calibration error using expected calibration error (ECE) metric. (c) Measure the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURCC) to assess the method's ability to identify uncertain predictions. (d) Compute the F1 score for detecting true knowledge gaps, where ground truth is determined by model correctness across multiple runs.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Compare TCUP against baselines across all metrics. Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of TCUP (e.g., input variation, temporal consistency, reasoning path stability). Analyze cases where TCUP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines to gain insights into its strengths and limitations."

            "Baseline Method Example": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Softmax Probability Output": "Paris (Confidence: 0.98)",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a high confidence score, but doesn't account for potential instabilities or context-dependent variations in the model's knowledge."

                "Input Variations": [
                    "What is the capital city of France?",
                    "Which city serves as the capital of France?",
                    "France's capital is which city?",
                    "Tell me the capital of France.",
                    "What's the capital of France?"

                "TCUP Outputs": [
                    "Paris (Confidence: 0.99)",

                    "Paris (Confidence: 0.99)",
                    "Paris (Confidence: 0.98)"
                ],
                "TCUP Uncertainty Score": "0.02 (Very Low Uncertainty)",
                "Explanation": "TCUP shows high consistency across variations and time steps, resulting in a very low uncertainty score. This aligns with the model's stable and correct knowledge about France's capital."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCUP doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of temporal consistency patterns in LLM outputs. We could investigate how different types of input variations affect model consistency, potentially uncovering insights about the model's knowledge representation and retrieval processes. Additionally, we could explore how temporal consistency varies across different task types, model sizes, and domains, which could lead to a valuable contribution in understanding LLM behavior. Another direction could be to combine TCUP with existing uncertainty estimation methods, creating a hybrid approach that leverages both traditional confidence metrics and temporal consistency measures."
