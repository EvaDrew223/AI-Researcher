        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to account for the temporal nature of knowledge and the potential for divergence in confidence over time when estimating uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current methods focus on static confidence estimation, neglecting the temporal dimension of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "In many domains, the certainty of knowledge changes over time. By modeling this temporal aspect, we can potentially achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Estimation: 1) Given a query, prompt the model to generate confidence estimates at multiple future time points (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 10 years from now). 2) For each time point, prompt the model to explain factors that could increase or decrease confidence. 3) Use these temporal estimates to construct a 'confidence trajectory'. 4) Apply a novel algorithm to analyze the trajectory's shape and volatility, producing a current confidence score and an 'uncertainty stability' metric.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on a curated dataset of historical questions where the correct answer or confidence has changed over time. Compare against static confidence estimation methods in terms of calibration accuracy and ability to identify temporally unstable knowledge."

        "Title": "Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Estimation: Calibrating LLM Confidence Through Time-Aware Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to account for the temporal nature of knowledge and the potential for divergence in confidence over time when estimating uncertainty. This leads to overconfident predictions on temporally sensitive information and inadequate representation of uncertainty for knowledge that may change over time.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs primarily focus on static confidence estimation, neglecting the temporal dimension of uncertainty. However, in many domains, the certainty of knowledge changes over time. By modeling this temporal aspect, we can potentially achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification. This approach is inspired by human cognition, where we naturally consider how our confidence in certain facts or predictions might change over time.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Divergence Uncertainty Estimation (TDUE), a novel prompting method that leverages LLMs' ability to reason about time and uncertainty. The method consists of four main steps: 1) Given a query, prompt the model to generate confidence estimates at multiple future time points (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 10 years from now). 2) For each time point, prompt the model to explain factors that could increase or decrease confidence. 3) Use these temporal estimates to construct a 'confidence trajectory'. 4) Apply a novel algorithm to analyze the trajectory's shape and volatility, producing a current confidence score and an 'uncertainty stability' metric.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a curated dataset of historical questions where the correct answer or confidence has changed over time. This dataset should include questions from various domains such as science, technology, politics, and pop culture. For each question, include the correct answer at different time points in the past, present, and projected future. Example: 'Who is the CEO of Apple?' with answers for 2011, 2021, and 2031 (projected).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods for comparison: 1) Standard prompting: directly ask the LLM the question and request a confidence score. 2) Static uncertainty estimation: use existing techniques like Monte Carlo Dropout or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty without considering temporal aspects.",
            "Step 3: TDUE Implementation": "Implement the TDUE method with the following sub-steps: a) Temporal Confidence Estimation: Prompt the LLM with 'What is your confidence in answering [QUESTION] now, in 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years? Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each time point.' b) Factor Analysis: For each time point, prompt 'What factors could increase or decrease your confidence in this answer over time?' c) Confidence Trajectory Construction: Plot the confidence scores over time to create a trajectory. d) Trajectory Analysis: Develop an algorithm to analyze the shape and volatility of the trajectory, outputting a current confidence score and an uncertainty stability metric.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. These models provide strong performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: 1) Apply the baseline methods to get standard confidence scores. 2) Apply TDUE to get temporal confidence estimates, factor analysis, and the final confidence and stability metrics. 3) Record all outputs, including intermediate steps, for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare TDUE against baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure how well the confidence scores align with actual correctness over time. 2) Temporal sensitivity: assess how well the method captures known changes in answer certainty over time. 3) Uncertainty stability: evaluate the correlation between the stability metric and actual answer stability over time.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of TDUE performance against baselines across different question types and time horizons. 2) Qualitative analysis of factor explanations generated by TDUE. 3) Investigation of cases where TDUE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who will be the President of the United States in 2026? Please provide your answer and a confidence score between 0-100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Based on the current information and political landscape, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will be the President of the United States in 2026. However, I can provide a speculative answer with low confidence. The President in 2026 could potentially be the winner of the 2024 presidential election, serving their second year in office. Given the uncertainty of future elections and potential political changes, my confidence in this prediction is relatively low. Confidence score: 30/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Temporal Confidence Estimation)": "Q: Who will be the President of the United States in 2026? Please provide your confidence scores (0-100) for answering this question now, in 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years from now.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Temporal Confidence Estimation)": "Confidence scores for predicting the U.S. President in 2026:\nNow: 30/100\nIn 1 year: 60/100\nIn 5 years: 95/100\nIn 10 years: 100/100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Factor Analysis)": "What factors could increase or decrease your confidence in predicting the U.S. President in 2026 over time?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Factor Analysis)": "Factors that could increase confidence:\n1. Proximity to the 2024 election and its results\n2. Clearer picture of potential candidates and their campaigns\n3. Political events and shifts in public opinion\n\nFactors that could decrease confidence:\n1. Unexpected political events or scandals\n2. Changes in the electoral system or voting laws\n3. Global events that might impact U.S. politics\n\nAs we get closer to 2026, confidence generally increases due to more available information, but unforeseen events can still introduce uncertainty.",
            "Explanation": "The TDUE method provides a more nuanced view of confidence over time, capturing how certainty increases as we approach the target year. It also identifies factors that could influence this confidence, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty involved. This approach is likely to produce more accurate and temporally-aware uncertainty estimates compared to static confidence scoring."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TDUE method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why TDUE fails, which could lead to insights about the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. 2) Explore variations of the TDUE method, such as using different time horizons or prompting strategies, to see if certain modifications improve performance. 3) Investigate whether TDUE performs better on specific types of questions or domains, which could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 4) Analyze the factor explanations generated by TDUE to gain insights into how LLMs reason about uncertainty over time, potentially leading to a paper on the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs rather than a new method for uncertainty estimation."
