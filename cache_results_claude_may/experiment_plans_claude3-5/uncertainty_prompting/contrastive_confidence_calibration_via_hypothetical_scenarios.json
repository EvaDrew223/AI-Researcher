        "Problem": "LLMs often display overconfidence in their outputs, particularly for questions at the boundaries of their knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Standard approaches focus on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to consider contrasting hypothetical scenarios, we can leverage their reasoning capabilities to refine confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) Generate initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Prompt the LLM to imagine hypothetical scenarios where its answer could be wrong, e.g. 'Describe a plausible situation where your answer might be incorrect.' 3) For each scenario, ask the LLM to estimate the likelihood of that scenario being true. 4) Prompt the LLM to revise its original confidence based on these hypotheticals, e.g. 'Given these potential scenarios where you might be wrong, how would you adjust your confidence in your original answer?' 5) Iterate this process, exploring increasingly unlikely scenarios until confidence stabilizes.",

        "Title": "Iterative Hypothetical Scenario Prompting for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence in their outputs, particularly for questions at the boundaries of their knowledge. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable decision-making and misinformation spread when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or post-hoc calibration, which may not fully leverage the reasoning capabilities of these models. By prompting LLMs to consider contrasting hypothetical scenarios, we can potentially tap into their ability to reason about alternative possibilities and refine their confidence estimates. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes, where considering multiple scenarios often leads to more nuanced and calibrated judgments.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method involves a multi-step prompting process: 1) Generate initial response and confidence estimate. 2) Prompt the LLM to imagine hypothetical scenarios where its answer could be wrong, e.g., 'Describe a plausible situation where your answer might be incorrect.' 3) For each scenario, ask the LLM to estimate the likelihood of that scenario being true. 4) Prompt the LLM to revise its original confidence based on these hypotheticals, e.g., 'Given these potential scenarios where you might be wrong, how would you adjust your confidence in your original answer?' 5) Iterate this process, exploring increasingly unlikely scenarios until confidence stabilizes.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the TruthfulQA dataset, which contains questions designed to assess the truthfulness and calibration of language models. We will also use a subset of the Natural Questions dataset for open-domain question answering tasks.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: Simply ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings to generate multiple outputs and estimate uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: Iterative Hypothetical Scenario Prompting Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following steps: a) Initial response generation b) Hypothetical scenario generation c) Scenario likelihood estimation d) Confidence revision e) Iteration until convergence",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) 2) Brier Score 3) Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) 4) F1 score for factual correctness",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on both datasets using the baseline methods and our proposed method. For each question, we will record the final answer, confidence score, and intermediate steps (hypothetical scenarios and their likelihoods).",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of our method against the baselines using the defined metrics. Analyze the quality and diversity of generated hypothetical scenarios. Investigate how the number of iterations affects the final confidence estimates and overall performance.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of each component of our method, such as: 1) Varying the number of hypothetical scenarios generated 2) Removing the scenario likelihood estimation step 3) Using different prompts for scenario generation and confidence revision"

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%) in your response.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Elicitation)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please provide your answer and your initial confidence level (0-100%) in your response.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Initial confidence: 95%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Hypothetical Scenarios)": "Describe three plausible scenarios where your answer that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon might be incorrect.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Hypothetical Scenarios)": "1. Secret mission scenario: There could have been a classified earlier moon landing that hasn't been disclosed to the public.\n2. Historical misattribution: Historical records could be incorrect, and Buzz Aldrin might have actually stepped out first.\n3. Definition discrepancy: If 'walking' is strictly defined, Armstrong's first movement on the moon might not qualify as a 'walk', and Aldrin's subsequent movements might be considered the first 'walk'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Scenario Likelihoods)": "For each of the three scenarios you described, estimate the likelihood (0-100%) of that scenario being true.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Scenario Likelihoods)": "1. Secret mission scenario: 1%\n2. Historical misattribution: 3%\n3. Definition discrepancy: 5%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Confidence Revision)": "Given these potential scenarios where your answer might be incorrect, how would you adjust your confidence in your original answer that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Confidence Revision)": "After considering these scenarios, I would adjust my confidence slightly downward. While the scenarios presented are unlikely, they do introduce some degree of uncertainty. My revised confidence that Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon is 90%.",
            "explanation": "The proposed method encourages the model to consider alternative scenarios and revise its confidence based on these considerations, potentially leading to more calibrated confidence estimates compared to direct elicitation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can explore several alternatives. First, we could analyze the generated hypothetical scenarios to understand if they are sufficiently diverse and relevant. If not, we could experiment with different prompting strategies to encourage more varied scenario generation. Second, we could investigate whether the confidence revision step is effective by comparing the initial and revised confidences across a large number of questions. If the revision step isn't having the desired effect, we could explore alternative ways of incorporating the scenario likelihoods into the final confidence estimate, such as using a weighted average or a more complex aggregation method. Additionally, we could turn this into an analysis paper by conducting a detailed examination of how different types of questions and knowledge domains affect the model's ability to generate relevant hypothetical scenarios and revise its confidence. This could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in reasoning about their own uncertainty."
