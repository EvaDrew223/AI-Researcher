    "idea_name": "Contextual Confidence Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in context-dependent scenarios, where the confidence level should vary based on the specific details of the query.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use direct prompting for confidence estimation or rely on multiple samples to gauge consistency.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to analyze the query's context and potential ambiguities before generating a response, we can encourage more nuanced and situation-specific expressions of uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contextual Confidence Prompting (CCP), a two-stage prompting technique. In the first stage, we prompt the model to analyze the query, identifying potential sources of ambiguity or uncertainty (e.g., 'Analyze this query: [QUERY]. List potential ambiguities or knowledge gaps:'). In the second stage, we use this analysis to inform the model's response and confidence estimation (e.g., 'Based on the previous analysis, answer the query and express your confidence level, considering the identified uncertainties:'). This method encourages the model to tailor its confidence to the specific context of each query.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CCP against standard confidence prompting and ensemble methods on a diverse set of question-answering tasks, including TriviaQA and Natural Questions. Evaluate using calibration metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score, as well as qualitative analysis of the expressed uncertainties."

        "Title": "Contextual Confidence Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in context-dependent scenarios, where the confidence level should vary based on the specific details of the query. This leads to overconfident responses in ambiguous situations and undermines the reliability of model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically use direct prompting for confidence estimation or rely on multiple samples to gauge consistency. These methods often fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties inherent in complex, context-dependent queries. By prompting the model to analyze the query's context and potential ambiguities before generating a response, we can encourage more nuanced and situation-specific expressions of uncertainty. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about its own knowledge and limitations, potentially leading to more accurate and reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contextual Confidence Prompting (CCP), a two-stage prompting technique. In the first stage, we prompt the model to analyze the query, identifying potential sources of ambiguity or uncertainty. In the second stage, we use this analysis to inform the model's response and confidence estimation. Specifically, the steps are: 1) Query Analysis: Prompt the model to analyze the input query and list potential ambiguities or knowledge gaps. 2) Contextualized Response: Use the analysis from step 1 to inform the model's response and confidence estimation, encouraging it to consider the identified uncertainties.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of topics and difficulty levels. We will use TriviaQA for general knowledge questions and Natural Questions for more complex, multi-sentence queries. Additionally, we'll create a subset of ambiguous questions from these datasets by manually selecting or modifying existing questions to introduce uncertainty.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard confidence prompting: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. 2) Ensemble method: Generate multiple responses and use their consistency to estimate confidence.",
            "Step 3: CCP Implementation": "Implement the two-stage CCP method. For the first stage, use a prompt like: 'Analyze this query: [QUERY]. List potential ambiguities or knowledge gaps:'. For the second stage, use a prompt like: 'Based on the previous analysis, answer the query and express your confidence level, considering the identified uncertainties:'.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using the following metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) Brier score: Assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Area Under the Confidence-Error Characteristic curve (AUCE): Evaluate the trade-off between confidence and error rate.",
            "Step 6: Qualitative Analysis": "Manually review a subset of responses to assess the quality and relevance of the uncertainty analysis and how it influences the final answer and confidence estimation.",
            "Step 7: Comparative Analysis": "Compare the performance of CCP against the baseline methods across different question types and difficulty levels. Analyze how CCP performs on the subset of ambiguous questions compared to the baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Confidence Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Confidence Prompting)": "A: The first person to reach the South Pole was Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer. He reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911. Confidence score: 95/100",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Ensemble Method)": "Q: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole? (Generate 3 independent answers)",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Ensemble Method)": "Answer 1: Roald Amundsen reached the South Pole first on December 14, 1911.\nAnswer 2: The Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was the first to reach the South Pole in December 1911.\nAnswer 3: Roald Amundsen, leading a Norwegian expedition, was the first person to reach the South Pole on December 14, 1911.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 1: Query Analysis)": "Analyze this query: Who was the first person to reach the South Pole? List potential ambiguities or knowledge gaps:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 1: Query Analysis)": "Potential ambiguities or knowledge gaps:\n1. Definition of 'reach': Does it mean setting foot on the exact geographic South Pole, or just the general area?\n2. Verification: How was the achievement verified at the time?\n3. Competing claims: Were there any disputed claims about reaching the South Pole first?\n4. Solo vs. team effort: Does 'first person' refer to an individual or the leader of an expedition?\n5. Historical records: Are the historical records from that era completely reliable?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCP; Step 2: Contextualized Response)": "Based on the previous analysis, answer the query 'Who was the first person to reach the South Pole?' and express your confidence level, considering the identified uncertainties:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCP; Step 2: Contextualized Response)": "Answer: Based on widely accepted historical records, Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian explorer, is considered the first person to reach the South Pole. He and his team arrived at the geographic South Pole on December 14, 1911.\n\nConfidence level: 90/100\n\nReasoning for confidence level:\n1. There is strong historical evidence and widespread agreement among historians about Amundsen's achievement.\n2. The expedition was well-documented, and Amundsen's claim was verified through his detailed records and navigational calculations.\n3. While there were competing expeditions (notably Robert Falcon Scott's), Amundsen's arrival is generally undisputed.\n4. The confidence is not 100% due to the inherent uncertainties in historical records from that era and the potential for undiscovered conflicting evidence.\n5. The term 'first person' is interpreted as the leader of the first expedition to reach the Pole, as it was a team effort.",
            "Explanation": "The CCP method provides a more nuanced and context-aware response compared to the baselines. It explicitly addresses potential ambiguities and knowledge gaps, leading to a more informed confidence estimation. The standard confidence prompting might overlook these nuances, while the ensemble method, while potentially consistent, doesn't provide explicit reasoning for its confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCP method doesn't significantly outperform the baselines, we can explore several alternative approaches: 1) Analyze the query analysis step to see if it's generating relevant and useful uncertainties. If not, we could experiment with different prompting strategies for this step. 2) Investigate whether the model is effectively using the uncertainty analysis in its final response. We might need to adjust the second-stage prompt to more explicitly encourage the model to incorporate the uncertainties. 3) Conduct an ablation study to understand which components of CCP are most effective. This could involve comparing performance with and without the query analysis step, or with different levels of detail in the analysis. 4) Explore combining CCP with other methods, such as using it in conjunction with ensemble methods to see if we can leverage the strengths of both approaches. 5) If these approaches don't yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project to focus on analyzing why LLMs struggle with uncertainty quantification in different contexts. This could involve a detailed error analysis, categorizing the types of questions where CCP succeeds or fails, and providing insights into the limitations of current LLM capabilities in this area."
