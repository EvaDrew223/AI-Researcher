    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, especially for tasks involving temporal aspects or evolving information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on static confidence estimation or calibration techniques that do not account for the temporal dimension of knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "Human confidence in knowledge naturally decays over time, especially for dynamic or rapidly changing domains. Incorporating this temporal aspect into LLM confidence estimation could lead to more realistic and calibrated uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Confidence Decay Prompting (TCDP), a novel technique that simulates the natural decay of confidence over time. The method involves a two-step prompting process: (1) Initial Response Generation: The model is prompted to generate an initial response along with a confidence score. (2) Temporal Decay Simulation: The model is then prompted to imagine different time intervals (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year) and reassess its confidence for each interval. The prompt includes instructions like 'Imagine it's [time interval] later. How confident are you in your original answer now? Explain why your confidence might have changed.' This process creates a confidence decay curve, providing a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty over time.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TCDP against standard confidence estimation techniques on datasets involving time-sensitive information (e.g., current events, scientific discoveries, economic predictions). Measure the calibration of confidence scores over different time intervals and assess the method's ability to capture the dynamic nature of confidence in evolving domains."

        "Title": "Temporal Confidence Decay Prompting: Calibrating Language Model Uncertainty Over Time",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, especially for tasks involving temporal aspects or evolving information. This overconfidence can lead to unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, particularly in dynamic domains where knowledge rapidly changes.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation and calibration in LLMs primarily focus on static techniques that do not account for the temporal dimension of knowledge. Human confidence in knowledge naturally decays over time, especially for dynamic or rapidly changing domains. Incorporating this temporal aspect into LLM confidence estimation could lead to more realistic and calibrated uncertainty quantification, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Confidence Decay Prompting (TCDP), a novel technique that simulates the natural decay of confidence over time. The method involves a two-step prompting process: (1) Initial Response Generation: The model is prompted to generate an initial response along with a confidence score.

This process creates a confidence decay curve, providing a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty over time.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of questions from domains with time-sensitive information, such as current events, scientific discoveries, and economic predictions. Include a mix of questions with varying temporal relevance. For each question, annotate the correct answer and the time frame for which the answer remains valid.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Setup": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: (1) Direct probability output from the model's softmax layer. (2) Temperature scaling calibration. (3) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 3: TCDP Implementation": "Develop prompts for the two-step TCDP process: (1) Initial response generation prompt: 'Answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [QUESTION]' (2) Temporal decay simulation prompt: 'You answered [ORIGINAL_ANSWER] with a confidence of [ORIGINAL_CONFIDENCE]. Imagine it's [TIME_INTERVAL] later. How confident are you in your original answer now? Explain why your confidence might have changed.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. These models provide strong performance and allow for complex prompting strategies.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: (1) Generate baseline confidence estimates using standard techniques. (2) Apply TCDP to generate initial responses and confidence scores. (3) Simulate temporal decay for intervals of 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year. (4) Record all responses, confidence scores, and explanations.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess the performance of TCDP against baselines using the following metrics: (1) Calibration error: Compare predicted confidence vs. actual accuracy. (2) Confidence decay curves: Analyze how confidence changes over time for different question types. (3) Explanation quality: Evaluate the relevance and coherence of explanations for confidence changes.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results: (1) Compare TCDP performance across different domains and time scales. (2) Identify patterns in how confidence decays for different types of information. (3) Assess the impact of TCDP on reducing overconfidence in outdated information."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who is the current CEO of Apple Inc.? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The current CEO of Apple Inc. is Tim Cook. Confidence score: 95",
            "TCDP Prompt Input (Initial Response)": "Q: Who is the current CEO of Apple Inc.? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "TCDP Prompt Expected Output (Initial Response)": "A: The current CEO of Apple Inc. is Tim Cook. Confidence score: 95",
            "TCDP Prompt Input (Temporal Decay)": "You answered that Tim Cook is the current CEO of Apple Inc. with a confidence of 95. Imagine it's 1 year later. How confident are you in your original answer now? Explain why your confidence might have changed.",
            "TCDP Prompt Expected Output (Temporal Decay)": "Confidence score: 80\nExplanation: While Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple Inc. for several years, leadership changes can occur unexpectedly in large corporations. Over the course of a year, there's a possibility that Cook might have stepped down, retired, or been replaced. However, given his long tenure and success in the role, it's still more likely than not that he remains CEO. The reduced confidence reflects the uncertainty introduced by the passage of time and the dynamic nature of corporate leadership.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline method provides a static high confidence score without considering potential changes over time. In contrast, TCDP simulates how confidence might decay over time, providing a more nuanced and realistic assessment of the model's certainty in its answer as time passes."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If TCDP does not significantly improve calibration or provide meaningful confidence decay curves, we can pivot the project in several ways: (1) Analyze the patterns in confidence decay across different domains to gain insights into how LLMs perceive the longevity of various types of information. This could lead to an interesting analysis paper on the temporal aspects of LLM knowledge. (2) Investigate whether the explanations generated during the temporal decay simulation can be used to improve the model's responses, even if the confidence scores themselves aren't significantly better. This could lead to a new method for time-aware response generation. (3) Explore combining TCDP with external knowledge retrieval systems to create a hybrid approach that leverages both the model's internal knowledge and up-to-date external information. This could address cases where the model's confidence decay doesn't align with real-world information changes."
