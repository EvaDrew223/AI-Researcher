        "Problem": "Traditional methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often fail to capture the inherent ambiguity and multiplicity of potential answers in complex language tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on producing single point estimates of confidence or simple distributions over discrete answer choices.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of quantum superposition in physics, where a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, we propose a method that allows LLMs to maintain and reason about multiple potential answers concurrently.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), a novel technique that encourages LLMs to generate and maintain a superposition of potential answers throughout the reasoning process. The prompting strategy begins by asking the LLM to generate multiple distinct answer possibilities, each with an associated amplitude (analogous to quantum amplitudes). The LLM is then guided through a series of 'interference' prompts, designed to cause these answer states to interact and evolve. These prompts might include comparing answer pairs, considering hypothetical evidence, or exploring potential implications of each answer. Throughout this process, the LLM updates the amplitudes of each answer state. The final uncertainty quantification is derived from the distribution of these amplitudes, providing a rich, multi-modal representation of the model's uncertainty. This approach allows for a more nuanced capture of uncertainty, particularly in scenarios where multiple answers may be partially correct or where the correct answer depends on subtle interpretations of the question.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate QSP against traditional uncertainty quantification methods on a range of tasks including open-ended question answering, creative writing, and scenario planning. We'll develop new evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the generated answer superpositions, including measures of diversity, coherence, and calibration of the final amplitude distributions. We'll also conduct a series of ablation studies to understand the impact of different types of 'interference' prompts on the evolution of the answer superposition."

        "Title": "Quantum Superposition Prompting: A Novel Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Traditional methods for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to capture the inherent ambiguity and multiplicity of potential answers in complex language tasks. Current approaches typically focus on producing single point estimates of confidence or simple distributions over discrete answer choices, which may not adequately represent the nuanced uncertainty present in many natural language processing tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of quantum superposition in physics, where a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, we propose a method that allows LLMs to maintain and reason about multiple potential answers concurrently. This approach aims to provide a richer, more nuanced representation of uncertainty, particularly in scenarios where multiple answers may be partially correct or where the correct answer depends on subtle interpretations of the question. By encouraging LLMs to generate and maintain a superposition of potential answers throughout the reasoning process, we hypothesize that we can better capture the full spectrum of uncertainty inherent in complex language tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Quantum Superposition Prompting (QSP), a novel technique that encourages LLMs to generate and maintain a superposition of potential answers throughout the reasoning process. The method consists of the following steps:\n1. Initial Superposition Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate multiple distinct answer possibilities, each with an associated amplitude (analogous to quantum amplitudes).\n2. Interference Prompts: Guide the LLM through a series of 'interference' prompts designed to cause these answer states to interact and evolve. These prompts might include comparing answer pairs, considering hypothetical evidence, or exploring potential implications of each answer.\n3. Amplitude Update: Throughout the interference process, prompt the LLM to update the amplitudes of each answer state based on the interactions and new information.\n4. Final Uncertainty Quantification: Derive the final uncertainty quantification from the distribution of these amplitudes, providing a rich, multi-modal representation of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate QSP:\n1. Open-ended Question Answering: Use the AmbigQA dataset, which contains questions with multiple valid answers.\n2. Creative Writing: Use a subset of the WritingPrompts dataset from Reddit, focusing on prompts that can lead to diverse story outcomes.\n3. Scenario Planning: Create a custom dataset of business scenario questions with multiple plausible outcomes.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods for comparison:\n1. Direct Prompting: Simply ask the question and get a single answer.\n2. Few-shot Prompting: Provide a few examples of questions and answers before asking the target question.\n3. Traditional Uncertainty Quantification: Use methods like Monte Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles to generate uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 3: QSP Implementation": "Implement the Quantum Superposition Prompting method:\n1. Initial Superposition: Prompt the LLM with: 'Generate 3-5 distinct possible answers to the following question, each with an associated probability (amplitude) that sums to 1: [QUESTION]'\n2. Interference Prompts: For each pair of answers, prompt: 'Compare and contrast answers X and Y. How might they interact or influence each other?'\n3. Amplitude Update: After each interference, prompt: 'Based on this interaction, how should the probabilities (amplitudes) of answers X and Y be updated? Provide the new probabilities.'\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until amplitudes stabilize.\n5. Final Distribution: Use the final set of amplitudes as the uncertainty distribution.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for all experiments, as it represents the current state-of-the-art in large language models.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Develop and implement the following evaluation metrics:\n1. Answer Diversity: Measure the semantic diversity of generated answers using embedding-based similarity metrics.\n2. Calibration: Assess how well the final amplitude distribution aligns with human judgments of answer plausibility.\n3. Coherence: Evaluate the logical consistency of the generated answer set.\n4. Task-specific Performance: Use dataset-specific metrics (e.g., BLEU for creative writing, accuracy for question answering) to assess the quality of the top-ranked answer.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset:\n1. Run all baseline methods and QSP on the entire dataset.\n2. Collect model outputs, including intermediate steps for QSP.\n3. Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method.\n4. Perform statistical significance tests to compare QSP with baselines.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of QSP:\n1. Vary the number of initial answers in the superposition.\n2. Experiment with different types of interference prompts.\n3. Adjust the number of interference iterations.\n4. Try different methods for amplitude initialization and updating.",
            "Step 8: Analysis and Visualization": "1. Create visualizations of the evolving amplitude distributions throughout the QSP process.\n2. Analyze patterns in how different types of questions benefit from QSP.\n3. Investigate cases where QSP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.\n4. Examine the relationship between answer diversity and task performance."

            "Example 1: Baseline Failure": {
                "Input": "Q: What will be the dominant form of transportation in major cities in 2050?",
                "Baseline Output (Direct Prompting)": "The dominant form of transportation in major cities in 2050 will likely be electric autonomous vehicles.",

                "QSP Output": "1. Electric autonomous vehicles (Amplitude: 0.4)\n2. Advanced public transit systems (e.g., hyperloops) (Amplitude: 0.3)\n3. Personal flying vehicles (Amplitude: 0.2)\n4. Bicycle and pedestrian-centric infrastructure (Amplitude: 0.1)",
                "Explanation": "QSP generates multiple plausible answers with associated amplitudes, capturing the uncertainty and diversity of possible future scenarios. This provides a more nuanced view of the potential outcomes, allowing for better-informed decision-making and planning."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed QSP method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we will pivot the project to focus on understanding why the method failed and what this reveals about LLMs' ability to reason about uncertainty. We will conduct a detailed error analysis, examining cases where QSP performed poorly compared to baselines. This analysis could involve categorizing types of questions or tasks where QSP struggles, investigating whether certain interference prompts lead to inconsistent or unreliable updates, and exploring how the model's confidence (as expressed through amplitudes) correlates with answer correctness or plausibility. Additionally, we could expand our investigation to compare QSP with other advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency methods, aiming to identify complementary strengths that could inform the development of hybrid approaches. Finally, we could explore whether QSP, even if not improving overall performance, provides unique insights into the model's reasoning process or uncertainty representation that could be valuable for interpretability or safety considerations in AI systems."
