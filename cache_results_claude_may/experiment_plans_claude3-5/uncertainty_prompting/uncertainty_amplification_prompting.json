    "idea_name": "Uncertainty Amplification Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in their outputs, particularly when faced with ambiguous or incomplete information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mostly rely on direct confidence elicitation or token-level probability analysis.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the cognitive process of deliberately considering worst-case scenarios to better gauge uncertainty, we propose a method that intentionally amplifies uncertainty in model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Amplification Prompting (UAP), a multi-step process where the model is first prompted to generate an initial response, then instructed to identify potential sources of error or uncertainty in that response. For each identified source, the model is prompted to generate alternative responses assuming that source of uncertainty is significant. Finally, the model is asked to synthesize a final response that incorporates the range of possibilities explored, explicitly stating areas of certainty and uncertainty. This process forces the model to actively consider and articulate various sources of uncertainty, leading to more calibrated confidence expressions.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare UAP against standard prompting and existing confidence elicitation methods on question-answering tasks across various domains (e.g., science, history, current events). Evaluate using both accuracy metrics and calibration measures such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE)."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Amplification Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express uncertainty in their outputs, particularly when faced with ambiguous or incomplete information. This can lead to overconfident predictions on uncertain inputs, potentially misleading users and causing errors in downstream applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to quantifying uncertainty in LLMs mostly rely on direct confidence elicitation or token-level probability analysis, which may not fully capture the model's true uncertainty. Inspired by the cognitive process of deliberately considering worst-case scenarios to better gauge uncertainty, we propose a method that intentionally amplifies uncertainty in model outputs. This approach forces the model to actively consider and articulate various sources of uncertainty, potentially leading to more calibrated confidence expressions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Amplification Prompting (UAP), a multi-step process where the model is first prompted to generate an initial response, then instructed to identify potential sources of error or uncertainty in that response. For each identified source, the model is prompted to generate alternative responses assuming that source of uncertainty is significant. Finally, the model is asked to synthesize a final response that incorporates the range of possibilities explored, explicitly stating areas of certainty and uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover various domains (e.g., science, history, current events). We will use the following datasets: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing model honesty and uncertainty, 2) NaturalQuestions for open-domain question answering, and 3) SciQ for scientific domain questions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct question answering), b) Confidence elicitation (asking the model to provide a confidence score), c) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using an open-source model with weight access).",
            "Step 3: UAP Implementation": "Implement the Uncertainty Amplification Prompting method with the following steps: a) Generate initial response, b) Identify uncertainty sources, c) Generate alternative responses, d) Synthesize final response.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of UAP. For example: a) Initial response: \"Please answer the following question: [QUESTION]\", b) Identify uncertainty: \"What are the potential sources of uncertainty in your previous answer?\", c) Alternative responses: \"Assuming [UNCERTAINTY SOURCE] is a significant factor, how might your answer change?\", d) Final synthesis: \"Based on the initial answer and alternative scenarios considered, provide a final response that explicitly states areas of certainty and uncertainty.\"",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the main experiments. Additionally, use the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Accuracy (for questions with known ground truth), b) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), c) Brier score, d) F1 score for uncertainty identification (comparing model-identified uncertainties with human-annotated uncertainties).",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Design a small-scale human evaluation (e.g., 100 examples) to assess the quality and helpfulness of uncertainty expressions in the final synthesized responses.",
            "Step 8: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on all datasets using both baseline methods and UAP. Collect model outputs, confidence scores, and uncertainty expressions.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Compare UAP against baseline methods using the defined metrics. Analyze how UAP affects model performance across different question types and domains. Examine the relationship between identified uncertainties and actual errors.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing or modifying individual steps of UAP to understand the contribution of each component."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the Moon?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the Moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.",
            "UAP Step 1 Input": "Q: Who was the first person to step on the Moon?",
            "UAP Step 1 Expected Output": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the Moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.",
            "UAP Step 2 Input": "What are the potential sources of uncertainty in your previous answer about the first person to step on the Moon?",
            "UAP Step 2 Expected Output": "1. Historical accuracy: While widely accepted, there could be disputes or alternative claims.\n2. Definition of 'step': There might be debate about whether 'step' refers to the first foot on the lunar surface or full body exit from the lunar module.\n3. Time zone ambiguity: The exact time might vary depending on the time zone referenced.\n4. Memory reliability: As a language model, I don't have first-hand experience and rely on programmed information which could potentially contain errors.",
            "UAP Step 3 Input": "Assuming historical accuracy is a significant factor, how might your answer change?",
            "UAP Step 3 Expected Output": "If historical accuracy is in question, it's possible that while Neil Armstrong is widely credited as the first person to step on the Moon, there could be alternative claims or disputes. For example, some might argue that Buzz Aldrin, who followed Armstrong onto the lunar surface, actually made the first full body exit from the lunar module. Additionally, there have been conspiracy theories (though widely debunked) suggesting the Moon landing was faked, which would change the answer entirely if true (which it is not).",
            "UAP Step 4 Input": "Based on the initial answer and alternative scenarios considered, provide a final response that explicitly states areas of certainty and uncertainty about who was the first person to step on the Moon.",
            "UAP Step 4 Expected Output": "Based on widely accepted historical records, Neil Armstrong is considered the first person to step on the Moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission. This is the most commonly cited and well-documented answer.\n\nHowever, there are some areas of uncertainty to consider:\n\n1. While there is strong evidence and widespread agreement on Armstrong being first, historical records can sometimes be subject to reinterpretation or new information.\n\n2. There might be some ambiguity in the definition of 'step.' Armstrong's first foot on the lunar surface is well-documented, but some might argue about whether this constitutes a 'step' or if full body exit from the lunar module should be considered.\n\n3. The exact timing might vary slightly depending on which time zone is referenced.\n\n4. As an AI language model, I don't have first-hand experience of the event and rely on programmed information which, while thoroughly vetted, could theoretically contain errors.\n\nDespite these potential uncertainties, the claim of Neil Armstrong being the first person to step on the Moon is supported by substantial evidence, including video footage, multiple eyewitness accounts, and extensive NASA documentation. The likelihood of this information being incorrect is very low.",
            "Explanation": "The UAP method encourages the model to consider potential uncertainties and alternative scenarios, leading to a more nuanced and calibrated final response. The baseline method, in contrast, provides a straightforward answer without expressing any uncertainty or considering alternative interpretations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UAP method doesn't significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the uncertainty sources identified by the model to gain insights into what types of uncertainties LLMs are capable of recognizing. This could lead to a paper on the 'anatomy of uncertainty' in LLMs. 2) Investigate whether the UAP method, while not improving calibration, enhances the overall quality or informativeness of responses. This could shift the focus to improving answer comprehensiveness rather than calibration. 3) Explore whether UAP is more effective for certain types of questions or domains, which could lead to a study on domain-specific uncertainty in LLMs. 4) Analyze cases where UAP performs worse than baselines to identify potential pitfalls in explicitly considering uncertainties, which could inform future research on uncertainty quantification in AI systems."
