        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different levels of knowledge and task complexity.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on simple confidence scoring or single-step uncertainty estimation.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems to better assess their confidence. We can leverage this approach to help LLMs better quantify their uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Decision Tree Prompting (PDTP), a novel method that guides LLMs to construct and traverse a decision tree for uncertainty quantification. The prompt instructs the LLM to: 1) Break down the main question into a series of sub-questions, forming a tree structure. 2) Assign probabilities to each branch of the tree based on the LLM's confidence in answering the sub-questions. 3) Traverse the tree, updating probabilities at each node. 4) Aggregate the final uncertainty by combining probabilities along the chosen path. This approach allows for fine-grained uncertainty estimation across different aspects of the problem.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare PDTP against baseline methods like direct confidence elicitation and ensemble disagreement on various question-answering datasets. Evaluate using calibration metrics, Brier scores, and correlation with human expert uncertainty ratings."

        "Title": "Probabilistic Decision Tree Prompting: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different levels of knowledge and task complexity. This limitation hinders their reliability and applicability in critical decision-making scenarios where understanding the model's confidence is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on simple confidence scoring or single-step uncertainty estimation, which fail to capture the nuanced levels of uncertainty in complex tasks. Human experts, on the other hand, often break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems to better assess their confidence. By leveraging this approach, we can potentially help LLMs better quantify their uncertainty. Our proposed method, Probabilistic Decision Tree Prompting (PDTP), aims to guide LLMs in constructing and traversing a decision tree for fine-grained uncertainty quantification, mimicking the human expert approach to problem-solving and confidence assessment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Decision Tree Prompting (PDTP), a novel method that guides LLMs to construct and traverse a decision tree for uncertainty quantification. The process involves four main steps: 1) Breaking down the main question into a series of sub-questions, forming a tree structure. 2) Assigning probabilities to each branch of the tree based on the LLM's confidence in answering the sub-questions. 3) Traversing the tree, updating probabilities at each node. 4) Aggregating the final uncertainty by combining probabilities along the chosen path. This approach allows for fine-grained uncertainty estimation across different aspects of the problem.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, 2) GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of task complexities and domain knowledge, allowing us to test the effectiveness of PDTP across different scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Direct confidence elicitation: simply ask the model to rate its confidence on a scale of 0-100%. 2) Ensemble disagreement: use multiple model runs and measure disagreement. 3) Temperature scaling: vary the temperature parameter and measure output distribution entropy.",
            "Step 3: PDTP Implementation": "Implement the PDTP method with the following steps: a) Develop a prompt template for breaking down questions into sub-questions. b) Create a prompt for assigning probabilities to each branch. c) Implement the tree traversal algorithm. d) Design a method for aggregating probabilities to produce the final uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art LLMs with different capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of PDTP against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure how well the model's confidence aligns with its accuracy. 2) Brier score: assess the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 3) Spearman correlation: compare model uncertainty with human expert uncertainty ratings (collected separately).",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Perform in-depth analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparison of PDTP performance across different task types and complexities. 2) Analysis of the decision tree structures generated by PDTP. 3) Investigation of cases where PDTP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Rate your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
                "Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 95%"
            },
            "PDTP Example": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Use the Probabilistic Decision Tree Prompting method to break down this question and quantify your uncertainty.",
                "Output": "1. Decision Tree Construction:\nRoot: Is the capital of France a European city?\n- Yes (95% confidence)\n  - Is it a city in Western Europe?\n    - Yes (90% confidence)\n      - Is it Paris?\n        - Yes (99% confidence)\n- No (5% confidence)\n\n2. Tree Traversal:\nFollowing the most likely path: Yes -> Yes -> Yes\n\n3. Probability Aggregation:\nFinal confidence = 0.95 * 0.90 * 0.99 = 0.8455 or 84.55%\n\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris, with 84.55% confidence."
            },
            "Explanation": "The PDTP method provides a more nuanced and transparent uncertainty quantification by breaking down the question into sub-questions and assigning probabilities at each step. This allows for a more fine-grained assessment of the model's confidence compared to the simple scalar confidence score in the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PDTP does not show significant improvements over the baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include examining the quality and relevance of the generated sub-questions, assessing the accuracy of probability assignments at each node, and investigating whether the tree structure is appropriate for different types of questions. We could also explore variations of PDTP, such as allowing for dynamic tree depth based on question complexity or incorporating external knowledge sources to improve sub-question generation. Additionally, we might pivot to focus on the interpretability aspects of PDTP, analyzing how the decision tree structures provide insights into the model's reasoning process and sources of uncertainty, even if they don't directly improve calibration metrics."
