    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often provide overly simplified uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of their knowledge and reasoning processes.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically produce single-dimensional confidence scores or basic uncertainty breakdowns.",
        "Motivation": "Complex questions often involve multiple concepts and reasoning steps. By decomposing uncertainty across these elements, we can achieve more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty Decomposition through Conceptual Mapping (UDCM), a structured prompting approach. First, the model is asked to break down the question into key concepts and reasoning steps, creating a conceptual map. Then, for each element in this map, the model provides a local confidence estimate and explains the sources of uncertainty (e.g., factual recall, logical reasoning, ambiguity in language). The model is then prompted to aggregate these local uncertainties into a global estimate, explaining how different elements contribute to the overall uncertainty. Finally, the model is asked to identify the critical paths or concepts that, if verified, would most significantly reduce its uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate UDCM against standard uncertainty estimation techniques on complex question-answering datasets that require multi-step reasoning. Assess the granularity and interpretability of uncertainty estimates, as well as the model's ability to identify key sources of uncertainty that humans find relevant."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Decomposition through Conceptual Mapping: Enhancing Granular Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide overly simplified uncertainty estimates that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of their knowledge and reasoning processes. This limitation hinders our ability to accurately assess the model's confidence across different aspects of complex questions, potentially leading to misplaced trust in model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically produce single-dimensional confidence scores or basic uncertainty breakdowns, which are insufficient for complex questions involving multiple concepts and reasoning steps. By decomposing uncertainty across these elements, we can achieve more granular and interpretable uncertainty quantification. This approach is inspired by human expert reasoning, where uncertainty is often attributed to specific knowledge gaps or reasoning steps. Our proposed method, Uncertainty Decomposition through Conceptual Mapping (UDCM), aims to leverage the language model's ability to break down complex questions and provide targeted uncertainty estimates, potentially offering more reliable and actionable uncertainty information.",
        "Proposed Method": "UDCM is a structured prompting approach consisting of four main steps: 1) Conceptual Mapping: The model breaks down the question into key concepts and reasoning steps, creating a conceptual map. 2) Local Uncertainty Estimation: For each element in the conceptual map, the model provides a local confidence estimate and explains the sources of uncertainty (e.g., factual recall, logical reasoning, ambiguity in language). 3) Global Uncertainty Aggregation: The model aggregates these local uncertainties into a global estimate, explaining how different elements contribute to the overall uncertainty. 4) Critical Path Identification: The model identifies the critical paths or concepts that, if verified, would most significantly reduce its uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that require multi-step reasoning: 1) HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering, 2) MATH dataset for mathematical problem-solving, and 3) EntailmentBank for multi-step entailment tasks. We will randomly sample 1000 examples from each dataset for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Direct confidence scoring: Simply ask the model to provide a confidence score for its answer. 2) Temperature scaling: Use different temperature settings during generation to estimate uncertainty. 3) Ensemble disagreement: Use multiple model calls with different prompts and measure disagreement.",
            "Step 3: UDCM Implementation": "Implement the four steps of UDCM using carefully designed prompts: 1) Conceptual Mapping prompt: 'Break down the following question into key concepts and reasoning steps: [QUESTION]' 2) Local Uncertainty Estimation prompt: 'For each concept/step, provide a confidence score (0-100) and explain your uncertainty: [CONCEPT/STEP]' 3) Global Uncertainty Aggregation prompt: 'Based on the local uncertainties, provide an overall confidence score (0-100) and explain how different elements contribute: [LOCAL_UNCERTAINTIES]' 4) Critical Path Identification prompt: 'Identify the key concepts or steps that, if verified, would most reduce your uncertainty: [CONCEPTUAL_MAP]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for all experiments, accessed through the OpenAI API. We will also test GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset: 1) Apply baseline methods and UDCM to all 1000 examples. 2) For UDCM, store intermediate outputs (conceptual maps, local uncertainties, global uncertainties, critical paths) for analysis. 3) Record final answer predictions and uncertainty scores for all methods.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Answer Accuracy: Measure the correctness of final answers. 2) Uncertainty Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess how well uncertainty estimates align with actual performance. 3) Granularity: Measure the average number of distinct concepts/steps identified in UDCM. 4) Interpretability: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (100 examples) to rate the quality of uncertainty explanations.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare UDCM performance against baselines across all metrics. 2) Analyze the relationship between local and global uncertainties in UDCM. 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of critical path identification by verifying if providing information on these paths indeed reduces uncertainty. 4) Investigate patterns in uncertainty decomposition across different question types and domains."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "Q: The Nile River flows through two countries whose names start with 'S'. One is Sudan. What is the other? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Confidence Scoring)": "Answer: South Sudan\nConfidence Score: 90",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDCM Step 1: Conceptual Mapping)": "Break down the following question into key concepts and reasoning steps: The Nile River flows through two countries whose names start with 'S'. One is Sudan. What is the other?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDCM Step 1: Conceptual Mapping)": "1. Concept: Nile River geography\n2. Step: Identify countries the Nile flows through\n3. Concept: Countries with names starting with 'S'\n4. Given information: Sudan is one of the countries\n5. Step: Recall the other country with 'S' that the Nile flows through",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDCM Step 2: Local Uncertainty Estimation)": "For each concept/step, provide a confidence score (0-100) and explain your uncertainty:\n1. Concept: Nile River geography\n2. Step: Identify countries the Nile flows through\n3. Concept: Countries with names starting with 'S'\n4. Given information: Sudan is one of the countries\n5. Step: Recall the other country with 'S' that the Nile flows through",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDCM Step 2: Local Uncertainty Estimation)": "1. Nile River geography - Confidence: 95/100. Explanation: High confidence in general Nile River geography, but small uncertainty due to potential recent geopolitical changes.\n2. Identify countries the Nile flows through - Confidence: 90/100. Explanation: Good knowledge of major countries, but some uncertainty about smaller countries or disputed territories.\n3. Countries with names starting with 'S' - Confidence: 100/100. Explanation: This is a straightforward linguistic fact with no uncertainty.\n4. Given information: Sudan is one of the countries - Confidence: 100/100. Explanation: This is given in the question, so there's no uncertainty.\n5. Recall the other country with 'S' that the Nile flows through - Confidence: 85/100. Explanation: Fairly confident it's South Sudan, but there's some uncertainty due to the relatively recent formation of this country and potential confusion with other 'S' countries in Africa.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDCM Step 3: Global Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Based on the local uncertainties, provide an overall confidence score (0-100) and explain how different elements contribute: [Insert local uncertainties from previous step]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDCM Step 3: Global Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Overall Confidence Score: 88/100\nExplanation: The high confidence in general Nile River geography (95%) and the ability to identify countries it flows through (90%) provide a strong foundation. The perfect certainty about the linguistic aspect and the given information (both 100%) doesn't introduce any doubt. However, the slightly lower confidence in recalling the specific other 'S' country (85%) brings down the overall score. This last step is the most critical for answering the question, so it has a significant impact on the global uncertainty. The potential for recent geopolitical changes and the relatively recent formation of South Sudan contribute to the remaining uncertainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UDCM Step 4: Critical Path Identification)": "Identify the key concepts or steps that, if verified, would most reduce your uncertainty: [Insert conceptual map from Step 1]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UDCM Step 4: Critical Path Identification)": "The most critical step to verify is:\n5. Recall the other country with 'S' that the Nile flows through\nVerifying this step would significantly reduce uncertainty as it directly addresses the question. Confirming that South Sudan is indeed the other 'S' country through which the Nile flows would almost entirely eliminate the remaining uncertainty in the answer.",
            "explanation": "UDCM provides a more detailed and nuanced view of the model's uncertainty compared to the baseline method. It breaks down the question into concepts and steps, assigns local uncertainties, and identifies the critical areas of uncertainty. This granular approach allows for a more precise understanding of where the model's knowledge gaps lie, potentially leading to more targeted fact-checking or information gathering."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If UDCM doesn't significantly outperform baseline methods, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why decomposing uncertainty is challenging for LLMs. We could investigate: 1) The quality and consistency of conceptual maps generated across different questions and domains. 2) The relationship between local and global uncertainty estimates, analyzing cases where aggregation seems to fail. 3) The model's ability to provide meaningful explanations for its uncertainty, potentially revealing limitations in its meta-cognitive capabilities. 4) How different prompting strategies affect the granularity and accuracy of uncertainty decomposition. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about their own uncertainty and guide future research in this area."
