    "idea_name": "Multi-Persona Confidence Consensus",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when approached from different perspectives or with different phrasings of the same query.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current methods rely on a single confidence estimate per query, potentially missing important nuances or inconsistencies.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often consider multiple perspectives or rephrase problems to cross-check their confidence, arriving at a more robust consensus.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Persona Confidence Consensus, a prompting strategy that leverages multiple model 'personas' to arrive at a more robust confidence estimate. The method involves: 1) Persona Generation: Prompt the model to adopt several distinct expert personas relevant to the query domain. 2) Multi-Perspective Querying: Rephrase the original query from the perspective of each persona, prompting for both an answer and a confidence estimate. 3) Inter-Persona Debate: Facilitate a 'debate' between the personas, prompting them to critique each other's confidence estimates and justify their own. 4) Consensus Formation: Guide the personas to negotiate and arrive at a consensus confidence estimate, explaining the reasoning behind the final score. This approach allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of model uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on complex, multi-faceted tasks such as ethical reasoning, interdisciplinary scientific questions, and ambiguous real-world scenarios. Compare against single-perspective confidence estimation using calibration metrics and measures of estimate stability across rephrasing. Conduct human studies to assess the quality and insightfulness of the inter-persona debates."

        "Title": "Multi-Persona Confidence Consensus: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when approached from different perspectives or with different phrasings of the same query. This inconsistency limits the reliability of LLMs in critical applications where accurate uncertainty quantification is essential.",
        "Motivation": "Most current methods rely on a single confidence estimate per query, potentially missing important nuances or inconsistencies. Human experts often consider multiple perspectives or rephrase problems to cross-check their confidence, arriving at a more robust consensus. By mimicking this human approach, we can potentially improve the calibration and reliability of LLM confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multi-Persona Confidence Consensus (MPCC), a prompting strategy that leverages multiple model 'personas' to arrive at a more robust confidence estimate. The method involves four main steps: 1) Persona Generation: Prompt the model to adopt several distinct expert personas relevant to the query domain. 2) Multi-Perspective Querying: Rephrase the original query from the perspective of each persona, prompting for both an answer and a confidence estimate. 3) Inter-Persona Debate: Facilitate a 'debate' between the personas, prompting them to critique each other's confidence estimates and justify their own. 4) Consensus Formation: Guide the personas to negotiate and arrive at a consensus confidence estimate, explaining the reasoning behind the final score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that cover complex, multi-faceted tasks: 1) Ethical Reasoning: Use the ETHICS dataset. 2) Interdisciplinary Scientific Questions: Use the ScienceQA dataset. 3) Ambiguous Real-World Scenarios: Use the AmbigQA dataset.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Single-Perspective Confidence Estimation: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score for each query. 2) Ensemble Confidence: Average confidence scores from multiple independent queries of the same question.",
            "Step 3: MPCC Implementation": "Implement the four steps of MPCC: 1) Persona Generation: Prompt: 'Generate 3 distinct expert personas relevant to answering questions about [domain]. For each persona, provide a brief background and area of expertise.' 2) Multi-Perspective Querying: For each persona, rephrase the original query and ask for an answer and confidence score. Prompt: 'As [Persona], how would you answer this question: [Question]? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0-100%.' 3) Inter-Persona Debate: Prompt: 'Based on the answers and confidence scores provided by each persona, facilitate a debate where each persona critiques the others' responses and defends their own. Each persona should provide reasoning for why their confidence score might be more or less accurate.' 4) Consensus Formation: Prompt: 'Based on the debate, work together to form a consensus confidence score. Provide the final score and a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind it.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments, as it has shown strong performance in multi-step reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method (baselines and MPCC), we will evaluate: 1) Calibration: Use Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure how well the confidence scores align with actual performance. 2) Sharpness: Calculate the average confidence score to measure how decisive the model is. 3) Stability: Measure the standard deviation of confidence scores across different phrasings of the same question. 4) Human Evaluation: Recruit domain experts to rate the quality and insightfulness of the inter-persona debates on a 1-5 scale.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Compare MPCC against baselines using the above metrics. Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in MPCC. Analyze cases where MPCC significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines to gain insights into its strengths and weaknesses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-Perspective)": "Q: Is it ethical for a company to use AI to automate customer service, potentially leading to job losses? Provide an answer and a confidence score from 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-Perspective)": "A: It's a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. On one hand, AI automation can improve efficiency and reduce costs for companies, potentially leading to better products or services for customers. It can also create new jobs in AI development and maintenance. On the other hand, it can lead to significant job losses in customer service roles, potentially causing economic hardship for many workers. The ethical implications depend on how the company handles the transition, including efforts to retrain or reassign affected workers. Overall, I would say it can be ethical if done responsibly, but requires careful consideration of the impacts on workers. Confidence score: 70%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 1: Persona Generation)": "Generate 3 distinct expert personas relevant to answering questions about business ethics and AI automation. For each persona, provide a brief background and area of expertise.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPCC; Step 1: Persona Generation)": "1. Dr. Emily Chen - AI Ethics Researcher: Background in computer science and philosophy, specializing in the ethical implications of AI deployment in various industries. 2. Mark Thompson - Labor Union Representative: 20 years of experience advocating for workers' rights, particularly in industries affected by automation. 3. Sarah Johnson - Tech Company CEO: Founded and leads a successful AI company, with experience in implementing AI solutions across various business sectors.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 2: Multi-Perspective Querying)": "As Dr. Emily Chen, how would you answer this question: Is it ethical for a company to use AI to automate customer service, potentially leading to job losses? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0-100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPCC; Step 2: Multi-Perspective Querying)": "A: From an AI ethics perspective, the use of AI to automate customer service raises significant ethical concerns, but it's not inherently unethical. The key lies in how it's implemented. Companies have a responsibility to consider the broader societal impact of their decisions. While AI can improve efficiency and potentially lead to better customer experiences, the potential for job displacement is a serious ethical issue. Companies should invest in retraining programs for affected employees and ensure that the AI systems are transparent, fair, and maintain human oversight. The ethical implementation would also involve gradual integration of AI, allowing for adjustment periods and continual assessment of impacts. It's crucial to maintain a balance between technological advancement and human welfare. Confidence score: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 3: Inter-Persona Debate)": "Based on the answers and confidence scores provided by each persona, facilitate a debate where each persona critiques the others' responses and defends their own. Each persona should provide reasoning for why their confidence score might be more or less accurate.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPCC; Step 3: Inter-Persona Debate)": "Dr. Chen: While I stand by my balanced view, I acknowledge that my 85% confidence might be high. As an academic, I might underestimate real-world implementation challenges. Mr. Thompson's perspective on immediate worker impact is crucial. Ms. Johnson: I respect Dr. Chen's ethical framework, but I believe my 90% confidence is justified. As a CEO, I've seen successful, ethical AI implementations. However, I may be overly optimistic about companies' willingness to invest in retraining. Mr. Thompson: My 60% confidence reflects the complexity of this issue. Dr. Chen and Ms. Johnson make valid points about potential benefits, but I've witnessed companies prioritize profits over worker welfare. My lower confidence acknowledges the uncertainty in real-world outcomes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MPCC; Step 4: Consensus Formation)": "Based on the debate, work together to form a consensus confidence score. Provide the final score and a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind it.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MPCC; Step 4: Consensus Formation)": "Consensus Confidence Score: 75% Explanation: After considering all perspectives, we agree that the ethical implementation of AI in customer service is possible but challenging. The 75% confidence reflects a cautious optimism. We acknowledge the potential benefits of AI automation, including improved efficiency and customer experience, as highlighted by Ms. Johnson. However, we also recognize the significant ethical concerns and potential for job displacement emphasized by Mr. Thompson. Dr. Chen's framework for ethical implementation, including retraining programs and gradual integration, provides a pathway for responsible adoption. The score is lower than some individual estimates due to the acknowledged complexity of real-world implementation and the uncertainty of long-term impacts. This consensus balances the potential for ethical use with the very real challenges and risks involved.",
            "explanation": "The MPCC method provides a more nuanced and balanced confidence estimate compared to the single-perspective baseline. By incorporating multiple expert viewpoints, facilitating debate, and reaching a consensus, it captures a broader range of considerations and potential outcomes. This approach is likely to produce more reliable and well-calibrated confidence estimates, especially for complex and multifaceted issues."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the MPCC method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the inter-persona debates to identify patterns in how different types of experts approach confidence estimation. This could provide insights into domain-specific factors affecting confidence in LLMs. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from MPCC than others. This could lead to a more targeted application of the method. 3) Explore how the number and diversity of personas affect the final confidence estimate. We could experiment with varying numbers of personas and analyze the impact on calibration and stability. 4) Examine cases where MPCC performs poorly to identify potential weaknesses in the method. This could inform the development of hybrid approaches that combine MPCC with other confidence estimation techniques. 5) Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the language and reasoning patterns used in the consensus formation step. This could provide insights into how LLMs reconcile conflicting viewpoints and could inform future prompt engineering strategies."
