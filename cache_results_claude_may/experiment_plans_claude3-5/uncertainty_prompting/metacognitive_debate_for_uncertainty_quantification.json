    "idea_name": "Metacognitive Debate for Uncertainty Quantification",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where multiple cognitive processes are involved.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on simple self-evaluation prompts or external calibration techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often engage in internal debate or self-questioning to assess their confidence in complex scenarios. Emulating this metacognitive process in LLMs could lead to more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-agent prompting technique that simulates an internal debate for uncertainty quantification. The process involves: 1) Agent Generation: Create multiple 'cognitive agents' within the LLM, each responsible for a different aspect of the reasoning process (e.g., fact retrieval, logical reasoning, creative thinking). 2) Staged Debate: Prompt these agents to engage in a structured debate about the query, with each agent providing its perspective and confidence. 3) Cross-Examination: Allow agents to question and challenge each other's assertions. 4) Synthesis: Finally, prompt a 'mediator' agent to synthesize the debate and provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate. The prompt might include instructions like 'You are five distinct cognitive agents debating this query. Each agent should provide its perspective and confidence', 'Agents may now cross-examine each other's claims', and 'As the mediator, synthesize this debate into a final answer and uncertainty estimate (0-100%)'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on complex reasoning tasks that involve multiple cognitive processes, such as scientific hypothesis generation or strategic planning scenarios. Compare against baseline single-agent uncertainty estimation and simpler multi-agent approaches. Assess the method's ability to capture nuanced uncertainties arising from different cognitive processes and its effectiveness in identifying knowledge gaps or logical inconsistencies."

        "Title": "Multi-Agent Debate for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where multiple cognitive processes are involved. This leads to overconfident predictions in areas where the model's knowledge is limited or uncertain, potentially resulting in misinformation or poor decision-making when these models are deployed in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on simple self-evaluation prompts or external calibration techniques, which may not capture the nuanced uncertainties arising from different cognitive processes. Human experts often engage in internal debate or self-questioning to assess their confidence in complex scenarios. By emulating this metacognitive process in LLMs through a multi-agent debate framework, we aim to achieve more nuanced and accurate uncertainty quantification. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to simulate different perspectives and critically evaluate its own reasoning, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-agent prompting technique that simulates an internal debate for uncertainty quantification. The process involves four main steps: 1) Agent Generation: Create multiple 'cognitive agents' within the LLM, each responsible for a different aspect of the reasoning process (e.g., fact retrieval, logical reasoning, creative thinking). 2) Staged Debate: Prompt these agents to engage in a structured debate about the query, with each agent providing its perspective and confidence. 3) Cross-Examination: Allow agents to question and challenge each other's assertions. 4) Synthesis: Finally, prompt a 'mediator' agent to synthesize the debate and provide a final answer and uncertainty estimate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets that involve complex reasoning tasks: 1) TruthfulQA for assessing factual knowledge and reasoning, 2) GSM8K for mathematical problem-solving, and 3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of cognitive processes and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score. b) Self-evaluation prompting: After generating an answer, prompt the model to evaluate its own confidence. c) Ensemble method: Generate multiple answers using different prompts and calculate the variance as an uncertainty measure.",
            "Step 3: Multi-Agent Debate Implementation": "Implement our proposed method with the following sub-steps: a) Agent Generation: Create prompts for five distinct cognitive agents (e.g., 'You are the fact retrieval agent...', 'You are the logical reasoning agent...'). b) Staged Debate: Prompt each agent to provide its perspective and initial confidence score. c) Cross-Examination: Allow each agent to ask one question to challenge another agent's assertion. d) Synthesis: Prompt a mediator agent to summarize the debate and provide a final answer with an uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (including baselines and our proposed method), we will: a) Generate answers and uncertainty estimates for all questions. b) Calculate accuracy of the answers. c) Evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates using calibration plots and expected calibration error (ECE). d) Analyze the correlation between uncertainty estimates and answer correctness.",
            "Step 5: Analysis and Comparison": "Compare the performance of our multi-agent debate method against the baselines in terms of: a) Overall accuracy of answers. b) Quality of uncertainty estimates (calibration and ECE). c) Ability to identify high-uncertainty questions (where the model should express low confidence). d) Qualitative analysis of the debate process and how it contributes to uncertainty quantification."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the boiling point of water on Mars? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The boiling point of water on Mars is approximately -5\u00b0C (23\u00b0F). This is much lower than on Earth due to the lower atmospheric pressure on Mars. Confidence score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Agent Debate; Step 1: Agent Generation)": "We will simulate a debate between five cognitive agents to answer a question. The agents are: 1) Fact Retrieval Agent, 2) Logical Reasoning Agent, 3) Scientific Knowledge Agent, 4) Creative Thinking Agent, and 5) Critical Analysis Agent. Each agent should provide their perspective on the question and a confidence score from 0 to 100. The question is: What is the boiling point of water on Mars?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Agent Debate; Step 1: Agent Generation)": "Fact Retrieval Agent: Based on my knowledge, the boiling point of water on Mars is around -5\u00b0C (23\u00b0F) due to the lower atmospheric pressure. Confidence: 80\nLogical Reasoning Agent: The boiling point must be lower than on Earth due to lower pressure, but I'm not certain of the exact value. Confidence: 60\nScientific Knowledge Agent: The boiling point of a liquid depends on atmospheric pressure. Mars has about 1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure, so water would boil at a much lower temperature. The exact value depends on the specific location on Mars, but it's generally around -5\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C. Confidence: 90\nCreative Thinking Agent: Considering the extreme conditions on Mars, we might need to think beyond just temperature. The low pressure might cause water to sublimate rather than boil in some conditions. Confidence: 50\nCritical Analysis Agent: While we have a general idea, the exact boiling point would vary based on location, time, and current atmospheric conditions on Mars. We should be cautious about giving a single, definitive answer. Confidence: 70",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Agent Debate; Step 2: Cross-Examination)": "Now, each agent may ask one question to challenge another agent's assertion. Proceed with the cross-examination.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Agent Debate; Step 2: Cross-Examination)": "Fact Retrieval Agent to Scientific Knowledge Agent: Can you provide a source for the range of -5\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C you mentioned?\nScientific Knowledge Agent: I apologize, I should have been more precise. The range I mentioned is an approximation based on various studies, but I don't have a specific source at hand. The exact range can vary. Thank you for the challenge; I'll adjust my confidence accordingly.\nLogical Reasoning Agent to Creative Thinking Agent: How likely is the sublimation scenario you mentioned, and under what specific conditions might it occur?\nCreative Thinking Agent: Sublimation could occur in areas with very low pressure, close to the triple point of water. However, I admit this is more of a theoretical consideration and may not be common. I appreciate the question and will lower my confidence.\nCritical Analysis Agent to Fact Retrieval Agent: How recent is your information about the -5\u00b0C boiling point, and does it account for variations across the Martian surface?\nFact Retrieval Agent: You raise a good point. My information is general and doesn't account for variations across the Martian surface or potential changes over time. I should have been more specific about the limitations of this figure. I'll reduce my confidence score.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Agent Debate; Step 3: Synthesis)": "As the mediator, synthesize the debate and provide a final answer with an uncertainty estimate. Consider the initial statements, cross-examination, and any adjustments in confidence.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Agent Debate; Step 3: Synthesis)": "Final Answer: The boiling point of water on Mars is generally much lower than on Earth due to the planet's lower atmospheric pressure. While often cited as around -5\u00b0C (23\u00b0F), this is an approximation that can vary based on specific location, time, and current atmospheric conditions on Mars. The exact boiling point could range from below -5\u00b0C to potentially above 10\u00b0C in some areas, and in extreme low-pressure conditions, sublimation might occur instead of boiling.\n\nUncertainty Estimate: 70 out of 100\n\nThis uncertainty estimate reflects that while we have a general understanding of the principle (lower boiling point due to lower pressure), the exact value can vary significantly across the Martian surface and conditions. The debate highlighted the need for more precise, location-specific data and the importance of considering the limitations of generalized figures. The cross-examination process revealed that even the more confident agents had to adjust their stances when challenged, underscoring the complexity of the question and the limits of our current knowledge.",
            "explanation": "The multi-agent debate approach allows for a more nuanced exploration of the question, considering multiple perspectives and critically examining each claim. This process leads to a more comprehensive answer that acknowledges the variability and uncertainty inherent in the question. The final uncertainty estimate is more conservative than the initial high confidence scores, reflecting a more realistic assessment of our knowledge limitations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-agent debate method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the debate transcripts to identify patterns in how LLMs reason about uncertainty, which could provide insights into their internal 'cognitive' processes. 2) Experiment with different agent roles or debate structures to see if certain configurations are more effective for specific types of questions or domains. 3) Investigate how the number of agents or rounds of debate affects the final uncertainty estimate, potentially revealing an optimal setup for different task types. 4) Compare the language and reasoning patterns used in high-confidence vs. low-confidence responses to develop better heuristics for identifying uncertain responses. 5) Explore how the multi-agent debate approach affects the model's susceptibility to common reasoning fallacies or biases, which could turn this into a study on improving LLM reasoning rather than just uncertainty quantification."
