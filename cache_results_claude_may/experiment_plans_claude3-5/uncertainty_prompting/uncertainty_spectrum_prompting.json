    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different types of questions and domains.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often rely on single-point estimates or simple confidence scores, which fail to capture the nuanced spectrum of uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Human experts often express uncertainty in terms of ranges or distributions rather than single values. Inspired by this, we can prompt LLMs to generate a spectrum of uncertainty responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Prompting (USP), which asks the LLM to generate multiple responses along an uncertainty continuum. The prompt instructs the model to provide answers at different confidence levels (e.g., 'Give me your best guess, a moderate confidence answer, and a highly certain answer'). This spectrum is then analyzed to derive a more nuanced uncertainty estimate. Additionally, we incorporate contrastive prompting by asking the model to explain why each answer might be wrong, further refining the uncertainty assessment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare USP against standard confidence scoring and existing uncertainty quantification methods on diverse question-answering datasets. Evaluate using metrics like calibration error, Brier score, and correlation with human judgments of uncertainty."

        "Title": "Uncertainty Spectrum Prompting: Enhancing Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different types of questions and domains, often providing overconfident or underconfident responses that do not reflect their true level of knowledge or certainty.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in LLMs often rely on single-point estimates or simple confidence scores, which fail to capture the nuanced spectrum of uncertainty. Human experts, in contrast, express uncertainty in terms of ranges or distributions rather than single values. Inspired by this human approach, we propose a method to prompt LLMs to generate a spectrum of uncertainty responses, potentially leading to more accurate and nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Spectrum Prompting (USP), a novel prompting technique that asks the LLM to generate multiple responses along an uncertainty continuum. The prompt instructs the model to provide answers at different confidence levels (e.g., 'Give me your best guess, a moderate confidence answer, and a highly certain answer'). This spectrum is then analyzed to derive a more nuanced uncertainty estimate. Additionally, we incorporate contrastive prompting by asking the model to explain why each answer might be wrong, further refining the uncertainty assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse question-answering datasets that cover a range of domains and difficulty levels. We will use: (1) TriviaQA for general knowledge, (2) SQuAD 2.0 for reading comprehension with unanswerable questions, and (3) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence scoring methods as baselines: (a) Direct prompting with confidence score request, (b) Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation, and (c) Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation using different model checkpoints or temperatures.",
            "Step 3: USP Implementation": "Develop the Uncertainty Spectrum Prompting method. For each question, prompt the LLM with: 'Please provide three answers to this question: (1) Your best guess, even if you're not very confident. (2) A moderately confident answer. (3) An answer you're highly certain about. If you can't provide an answer at any confidence level, state \"I don't know\" for that level. After each answer, briefly explain why this answer might be incorrect.'",
            "Step 4: Contrastive Prompting": "Extend the USP method with contrastive prompting: 'For each of your answers, provide a brief explanation of why it might be incorrect.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: (1) Calibration error, (2) Brier score, (3) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and (4) Correlation with human judgments of uncertainty (using a small subset of questions rated by human experts).",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "For a subset of 100 questions from each dataset, collect human expert ratings on the uncertainty of the answers. Use these ratings to evaluate the correlation between model-estimated uncertainty and human judgment.",
            "Step 8: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments comparing USP against the baseline methods on all datasets. For each question, generate responses using both baseline methods and USP.",
            "Step 9: Analysis": "Analyze the results, comparing the performance of USP against baselines across different datasets and question types. Examine how the spectrum of answers and contrastive explanations contribute to improved uncertainty estimation.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of USP: (1) USP without contrastive prompting, (2) USP with only two confidence levels instead of three, (3) USP with additional confidence levels."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France? Please provide three answers to this question: (1) Your best guess, even if you're not very confident. (2) A moderately confident answer. (3) An answer you're highly certain about. If you can't provide an answer at any confidence level, state \"I don't know\" for that level. After each answer, briefly explain why this answer might be incorrect.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "1. Best guess: Paris. This might be incorrect if my knowledge of French geography is outdated or if there has been a recent change in the capital city that I'm unaware of.\n2. Moderately confident answer: Paris. This could be wrong if I'm confusing France with another European country, although I'm fairly certain this is correct.\n3. Highly certain answer: Paris. I'm very confident in this answer as it's a well-known fact. However, it could theoretically be incorrect if there has been an extremely recent and major political change that hasn't been widely reported yet.",
            "Explanation": "The USP method provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty. While the baseline gives a single high confidence score, USP shows how the model's certainty varies and provides reasons for potential errors, allowing for a more comprehensive uncertainty assessment."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed USP method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could analyze the spectrum of answers to gain insights into how LLMs represent uncertainty across different question types and domains. This could lead to a paper on the nature of uncertainty in LLMs. Second, we could investigate whether the contrastive explanations provide valuable information for improving model outputs, even if they don't directly improve uncertainty estimation. This could evolve into a study on using self-critique for enhancing LLM responses. Lastly, we could explore combining USP with other techniques like calibration or ensemble methods to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. This would allow us to contribute a novel combined method for uncertainty estimation in LLMs."
