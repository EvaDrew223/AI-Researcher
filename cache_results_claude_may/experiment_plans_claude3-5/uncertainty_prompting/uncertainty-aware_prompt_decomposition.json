        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimates for complex queries that involve multiple sub-components or reasoning steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting with confidence scores or ensemble methods treat queries as monolithic units.",
        "Motivation": "Breaking down complex queries into simpler sub-components could allow for more granular and accurate uncertainty estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Decomposition (UAPD), a novel prompting technique that automatically breaks down complex queries into a tree of simpler sub-queries. For each sub-query, the model is prompted to provide both an answer and an uncertainty estimate. These sub-query uncertainties are then aggregated up the tree using a learned combination function to produce an overall uncertainty estimate for the full query. The decomposition process is guided by an uncertainty-minimizing objective, iteratively refining the sub-query structure to reduce overall uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate UAPD against baseline methods like few-shot prompting and ensembling on complex reasoning tasks from datasets like MATH and MMLU. Measure calibration using metrics like expected calibration error (ECE) and compare the granularity of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Decomposition for Improved Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimates for complex queries that involve multiple sub-components or reasoning steps. This leads to overconfident predictions on difficult questions and poor calibration, which can be problematic in high-stakes applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches like few-shot prompting with confidence scores or ensemble methods treat queries as monolithic units, which limits their ability to capture fine-grained uncertainties. Breaking down complex queries into simpler sub-components could allow for more granular and accurate uncertainty estimation. By leveraging the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to guide this decomposition process, we can potentially achieve better calibrated uncertainty estimates without requiring extensive additional training data or compute resources.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompt Decomposition (UAPD), a novel prompting technique that automatically breaks down complex queries into a tree of simpler sub-queries. The method works as follows:\n1. Given a complex query, prompt the LLM to generate a tree-structured decomposition into simpler sub-queries.\n2. For each sub-query, prompt the LLM to provide both an answer and an uncertainty estimate.\n3. Use a learned combination function to aggregate the sub-query uncertainties up the tree, producing an overall uncertainty estimate for the full query.\n4. Iteratively refine the decomposition structure by prompting the LLM to identify high-uncertainty sub-queries and further break them down.\n5. Stop when a maximum depth is reached or when further decomposition no longer reduces overall uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets:\n1. MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning\n2. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for diverse domain knowledge\n3. TruthfulQA for assessing model calibration on questions where the model may be uncertain",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines:\n1. Direct prompting: Simply ask the model to answer the question and provide a confidence score.\n2. Few-shot prompting with confidence: Provide examples of questions with answers and confidence scores.\n3. Ensemble method: Use multiple model runs or different model checkpoints and aggregate their predictions.",
            "Step 3: UAPD Implementation": "Implement the UAPD method as follows:\n1. Decomposition prompt: \"Break down this complex question into a tree of simpler sub-questions. Each node should represent a sub-question that helps answer the main question.\"\n2. Sub-query answering prompt: \"Answer this sub-question and provide your confidence on a scale of 0-100%.\"\n3. Implement the uncertainty aggregation function as a simple weighted average of sub-query uncertainties, with weights learned on a small validation set.\n4. Refinement prompt: \"Identify the sub-question with the highest uncertainty. Can you break it down further into even simpler sub-questions?\"\n5. Implement the stopping criterion based on maximum depth (e.g., 3) or uncertainty reduction threshold.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation": "For each dataset and method:\n1. Generate predictions and uncertainty estimates for all test questions.\n2. Compute accuracy and calibration metrics:\n   - Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n   - Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)\n   - Brier Score\n3. Analyze the granularity of uncertainty estimates by computing the variance of sub-query uncertainties within each full query.",
            "Step 5: Analysis": "1. Compare UAPD performance against baselines on accuracy and calibration metrics.\n2. Analyze how decomposition depth affects performance.\n3. Examine examples where UAPD significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines.\n4. Visualize some example query decompositions and uncertainty propagation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer is divisible by both 2 and 3? Provide your answer and your confidence in the answer on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: The probability that a randomly chosen positive integer is divisible by both 2 and 3 is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667.\n\nConfidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Decomposition)": "Q: What is the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer is divisible by both 2 and 3? Break down this complex question into a tree of simpler sub-questions. Each node should represent a sub-question that helps answer the main question.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. What does it mean for a number to be divisible by 2?\n2. What does it mean for a number to be divisible by 3?\n3. What numbers are divisible by both 2 and 3?\n   3.1. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3?\n4. How do we calculate the probability of selecting a number with a specific property from positive integers?\n   4.1. What is the pattern of numbers divisible by the LCM of 2 and 3?\n   4.2. How do we express this pattern as a fraction?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Sub-query Answering)": "Q: What does it mean for a number to be divisible by 2? Answer this sub-question and provide your confidence on a scale of 0-100%.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Sub-query Answering)": "Answer: A number is divisible by 2 if it is an even number, meaning it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. In other words, the last digit of the number is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nConfidence: 100%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Given the following sub-question confidences, calculate the overall confidence for the main question: [100%, 100%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Uncertainty Aggregation)": "Overall confidence: 89%",
            "Explanation": "The UAPD method allows for a more granular assessment of uncertainty by breaking down the complex probability question into simpler components. This decomposition enables the model to express high confidence in basic concepts (divisibility rules) while showing lower confidence in more complex steps (calculating probabilities). The aggregated uncertainty provides a more nuanced and potentially better calibrated estimate compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UAPD method doesn't significantly improve calibration over baselines, we can explore several alternative directions:\n1. Analyze the generated decompositions to understand if the LLM is breaking down questions effectively. If not, we could explore using retrieval-augmented generation to provide better examples of problem decomposition.\n2. Investigate different uncertainty aggregation functions, such as using the minimum confidence among sub-queries or a learned neural network for combining uncertainties.\n3. Experiment with prompting the model to generate multiple alternative decompositions and use ensemble methods over these decompositions.\n4. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify patterns in questions where UAPD performs poorly, which could inform the development of more targeted decomposition strategies.\n5. If decomposition doesn't help, we could pivot to exploring other calibration techniques that don't rely on query decomposition, such as temperature scaling or post-hoc calibration methods, and compare their effectiveness to UAPD."
