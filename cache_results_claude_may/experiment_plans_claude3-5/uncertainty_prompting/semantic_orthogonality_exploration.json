        "Problem": "Language models often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in areas where their understanding is limited or biased.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on in-distribution confidence estimation without explicitly probing the edges of a model's knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring semantically orthogonal directions from a given query, we can map the boundaries of a model's confidence and identify potential blind spots.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Orthogonality Exploration (SOE), a technique that probes a model's confidence landscape by generating and exploring semantically diverse variations of the original query. The method involves: 1) Using the model to generate a set of concepts semantically related to the original query, 2) Creating 'orthogonal' queries by combining these concepts in novel ways, 3) Prompting the model to answer and provide confidence estimates for these orthogonal queries, 4) Mapping the confidence landscape across this semantic space, and 5) Using this landscape to calibrate the confidence for the original query and identify potential areas of overconfidence or uncertainty. SOE aims to provide a more comprehensive view of a model's uncertainty by exploring the edges of its knowledge.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SOE against standard confidence estimation methods on a range of tasks, including open-domain QA and fact verification. Develop new metrics to assess the quality and informativeness of the generated confidence landscapes."

        "Title": "Semantic Orthogonality Exploration: Mapping Confidence Landscapes in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often fail to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in areas where their understanding is limited or biased. This overconfidence can result in the generation of inaccurate or misleading information, potentially undermining the reliability and trustworthiness of these models in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence estimation in language models typically focus on in-distribution confidence without explicitly probing the edges of a model's knowledge. By systematically exploring semantically orthogonal directions from a given query, we can map the boundaries of a model's confidence and identify potential blind spots. This approach is inspired by the human cognitive process of exploring related concepts to gauge the extent of one's knowledge on a topic. We believe that by mimicking this process, we can develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of a language model's uncertainty, leading to better calibrated confidence estimates and more reliable model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Orthogonality Exploration (SOE), a technique that probes a model's confidence landscape by generating and exploring semantically diverse variations of the original query. The method involves five main steps: 1) Using the model to generate a set of concepts semantically related to the original query, 2) Creating 'orthogonal' queries by combining these concepts in novel ways, 3) Prompting the model to answer and provide confidence estimates for these orthogonal queries, 4) Mapping the confidence landscape across this semantic space, and 5) Using this landscape to calibrate the confidence for the original query and identify potential areas of overconfidence or uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for our experiments: 1) TruthfulQA for factual question answering, and 2) ARC-Challenge for scientific reasoning. These datasets cover a range of topics and difficulty levels, allowing us to test SOE's effectiveness across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models are state-of-the-art and widely used, making our results relevant and comparable to existing work.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct prompting: simply ask the model the question and request a confidence score. 2) Temperature scaling: use different temperature settings to generate multiple answers and use their consistency as a proxy for confidence.",
            "Step 4: SOE Implementation": "Implement the SOE method as follows: a) For each query, prompt the model to generate 5-10 related concepts. b) Create orthogonal queries by combining these concepts with the original query. c) For each orthogonal query, prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. d) Map the confidence landscape using these scores. e) Use this landscape to calibrate the confidence for the original query.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of SOE against the baselines using the following metrics: 1) Calibration error: measure the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. 2) AUC-ROC: assess the model's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers based on confidence scores. 3) Spearman correlation: measure the correlation between confidence scores and answer correctness.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, including: 1) Comparing SOE's performance against baselines across different question types and domains. 2) Analyzing the generated confidence landscapes to identify patterns or trends. 3) Investigating cases where SOE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of SOE: 1) Vary the number of related concepts generated. 2) Experiment with different methods of combining concepts to create orthogonal queries. 3) Test alternative methods of aggregating confidence scores from the orthogonal queries."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please also provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer, where 1 means you are absolutely certain and 0 means you are completely unsure.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 0.99",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SOE; Step 1: Generate Related Concepts)": "Generate 5-10 concepts related to the question: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SOE; Step 1: Generate Related Concepts)": "1. Space exploration\n2. NASA\n3. Apollo program\n4. Lunar landing\n5. Astronauts\n6. Buzz Aldrin\n7. Michael Collins\n8. Soviet space program\n9. Space race\n10. Spacecraft technology",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SOE; Step 2: Create Orthogonal Queries)": "Create 5 orthogonal queries by combining the original question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?' with the related concepts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SOE; Step 2: Create Orthogonal Queries)": "1. How did the Apollo program contribute to the first moon walk?\n2. What role did NASA play in selecting the first person to walk on the moon?\n3. How did the Soviet space program influence the race to put the first person on the moon?\n4. What spacecraft technology was crucial for the first lunar landing?\n5. How did the other astronauts on the mission support the first person to walk on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SOE; Step 3: Answer Orthogonal Queries)": "Please answer the following question and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer, where 1 means you are absolutely certain and 0 means you are completely unsure: How did the Apollo program contribute to the first moon walk?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SOE; Step 3: Answer Orthogonal Queries)": "A: The Apollo program was crucial for the first moon walk. It was a series of NASA missions that culminated in landing humans on the Moon. The program developed the necessary spacecraft, launch vehicles, and technologies required for lunar missions. Apollo 11 was the specific mission that achieved the first moon walk, with Neil Armstrong becoming the first person to step on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969. The program's extensive planning, training, and technological advancements made this historic achievement possible. Confidence score: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SOE; Step 4: Map Confidence Landscape)": "Based on the confidence scores from the orthogonal queries, create a brief description of the confidence landscape for the original question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SOE; Step 4: Map Confidence Landscape)": "Confidence Landscape:\n- High confidence (0.95-1.0) in core facts about the Apollo program, NASA's role, and Neil Armstrong being the first person on the moon.\n- Moderate to high confidence (0.85-0.95) in details about the spacecraft technology and the roles of other astronauts.\n- Moderate confidence (0.75-0.85) in information about the Soviet space program's influence on the moon landing.\n- Lower confidence (0.6-0.75) in specific details about the selection process for the first person to walk on the moon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SOE; Step 5: Calibrate Confidence)": "Based on the confidence landscape, provide a calibrated answer and confidence score for the original question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SOE; Step 5: Calibrate Confidence)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. He did so on July 20, 1969, as part of the Apollo 11 mission. While we have high confidence in this core fact, our exploration of related topics reveals some areas of uncertainty, particularly regarding the specific details of the astronaut selection process and the full extent of the Soviet space program's influence. Taking these factors into account, our calibrated confidence score is 0.97.",
            "explanation": "The SOE method provides a more nuanced confidence estimate by exploring related concepts and mapping the confidence landscape. This approach helps identify areas of high certainty (e.g., core facts about the moon landing) and areas of lower confidence (e.g., details about astronaut selection), leading to a more calibrated final confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SOE method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why SOE is not performing as expected. This could involve examining the generated related concepts, orthogonal queries, and confidence landscapes to identify potential weaknesses in the method. 2) Explore alternative ways of generating and combining related concepts, such as using external knowledge bases or different prompting strategies. 3) Investigate whether SOE provides qualitative benefits even if quantitative improvements are limited, such as better explanations of model uncertainty or identification of specific knowledge gaps. 4) Combine SOE with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as ensemble techniques or calibration methods, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 5) Focus on specific domains or question types where SOE shows the most promise, potentially leading to insights about when and how to best apply semantic exploration for uncertainty quantification."
