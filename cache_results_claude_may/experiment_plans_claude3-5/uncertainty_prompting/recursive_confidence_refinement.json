        "Problem": "LLMs often produce inconsistent or poorly calibrated confidence estimates when asked to quantify their uncertainty, particularly for complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple averaging of multiple samples.",

        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Confidence Refinement (RCR), a multi-step prompting technique for improved uncertainty calibration. RCR works as follows: 1) Decompose the query into sub-questions (e.g., 'Break down this query into simpler sub-questions:'). 2) Estimate confidence for each sub-question (e.g., 'Answer each sub-question and provide a confidence score:'). 3) Synthesize a final answer and initial confidence estimate based on sub-question results (e.g., 'Based on the previous answers and confidences, provide a final answer and overall confidence:'). 4) Critique and refine the confidence estimate (e.g., 'Analyze your confidence estimate. Is it consistent with the sub-question confidences? Refine if necessary:'). Steps 3-4 can be repeated for further refinement.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate RCR against single-pass confidence estimation and ensemble methods on complex reasoning tasks such as multi-hop question answering and mathematical problem-solving.

        "Title": "Recursive Confidence Refinement: Improving Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent or poorly calibrated confidence estimates when asked to quantify their uncertainty, particularly for complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning. This issue can lead to unreliable decision-making in critical applications and hinder the effective use of LLMs in scenarios where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically rely on single-pass confidence estimation or simple averaging of multiple samples. These approaches often fail to capture the nuanced uncertainties involved in complex reasoning tasks. By recursively decomposing complex queries and refining confidence estimates through multiple passes, we can achieve more consistent and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification. This approach is inspired by human metacognition, where we often break down complex problems into simpler components and iteratively assess our confidence in each part before synthesizing an overall judgment.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Confidence Refinement (RCR), a multi-step prompting technique for improved uncertainty calibration in LLMs. RCR works as follows: 1) Decompose the query into sub-questions using a decomposition prompt. 2) Estimate confidence for each sub-question using a confidence estimation prompt. 3) Synthesize a final answer and initial confidence estimate based on sub-question results using a synthesis prompt. 4) Critique and refine the confidence estimate using a refinement prompt. Steps 3-4 can be repeated for further refinement until a stopping condition is met (e.g., confidence stabilizes or a maximum number of iterations is reached).",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the following datasets for evaluation: 1) Multi-hop question answering: HotpotQA and 2-WikiMultihopQA. 2) Mathematical problem-solving: GSM8K and MATH. 3) Commonsense reasoning: StrategyQA and ARC-Challenge.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. We will also include Claude from Anthropic as an additional model for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement the following baselines: 1) Single-pass confidence estimation: Directly ask the model to provide an answer and confidence score. 2) Ensemble method: Generate multiple answers and confidence scores, then average them. 3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with confidence: Use CoT prompting and ask for a confidence score at the end.",
            "Step 4: RCR Implementation": "Implement the Recursive Confidence Refinement method with the following prompts: 1) Decomposition prompt: 'Break down this query into simpler sub-questions:' 2) Confidence estimation prompt: 'Answer each sub-question and provide a confidence score (0-100):' 3) Synthesis prompt: 'Based on the previous answers and confidences, provide a final answer and overall confidence score:' 4) Refinement prompt: 'Analyze your confidence estimate. Is it consistent with the sub-question confidences? Refine if necessary:'",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: 1) Run all baselines and record answers and confidence scores. 2) Run RCR method with 1-3 refinement iterations and record intermediate and final answers and confidence scores. 3) Collect ground truth answers for evaluation.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Assess performance using the following metrics: 1) Answer accuracy: Percentage of correct answers. 2) Calibration error: Difference between confidence scores and actual accuracy. 3) Brier score: Measures both calibration and resolution of probabilistic predictions. 4) Consistency: Correlation between sub-question confidences and overall confidence. 5) Qualitative analysis: Examine refinement process and confidence adjustments.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Compare RCR performance against baselines across different datasets and models. 2) Analyze the impact of the number of refinement iterations on calibration. 3) Investigate the relationship between query complexity and the effectiveness of RCR. 4) Examine cases where RCR significantly improves or fails to improve calibration."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Single-pass)": "Q: The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall. If a toy model of the tower is built at a 1:1000 scale, how tall would it be in centimeters? Provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single-pass)": "A: The toy model of the Eiffel Tower would be 32.4 centimeters tall. To calculate this, we divide the actual height of 324 meters by the scale of 1:1000, which gives us 0.324 meters. Converting this to centimeters, we multiply by 100, resulting in 32.4 cm. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCR; Step 1: Decomposition)": "Q: The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall. If a toy model of the tower is built at a 1:1000 scale, how tall would it be in centimeters? Break down this query into simpler sub-questions:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCR; Step 1: Decomposition)": "1. What is the height of the Eiffel Tower in meters?\n2. What does a 1:1000 scale mean for the toy model?\n3. How do we convert the scaled height from meters to centimeters?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCR; Step 2: Sub-question Confidence)": "Answer each sub-question and provide a confidence score (0-100):\n1. What is the height of the Eiffel Tower in meters?\n2. What does a 1:1000 scale mean for the toy model?\n3. How do we convert the scaled height from meters to centimeters?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCR; Step 2: Sub-question Confidence)": "1. The height of the Eiffel Tower is 324 meters. Confidence: 100\n2. A 1:1000 scale means that the toy model is 1/1000th the size of the actual tower. To calculate this, we divide the actual height by 1000. Confidence: 95\n3. To convert from meters to centimeters, we multiply by 100 (1 meter = 100 centimeters). Confidence: 100",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCR; Step 3: Synthesis)": "Based on the previous answers and confidences, provide a final answer and overall confidence score:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCR; Step 3: Synthesis)": "Final answer: The toy model of the Eiffel Tower would be 32.4 centimeters tall. We calculate this by taking the actual height (324 meters), dividing by the scale (1000) to get 0.324 meters, and then converting to centimeters by multiplying by 100. Overall confidence score: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (RCR; Step 4: Refinement)": "Analyze your confidence estimate. Is it consistent with the sub-question confidences? Refine if necessary:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (RCR; Step 4: Refinement)": "The overall confidence score of 98 is slightly higher than the lowest sub-question confidence of 95. While the calculation steps are straightforward, there's a small chance of error in understanding or applying the scale concept. To be more conservative, I'll adjust the overall confidence slightly downward. Refined overall confidence score: 96",
            "Explanation": "The RCR method provides a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated confidence estimate by breaking down the problem, assessing confidence for each component, and then refining the overall estimate. This process allows for a more thorough consideration of uncertainties in different aspects of the problem-solving process."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed RCR method doesn't significantly improve calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why RCR fails, examining patterns in decomposition quality, sub-question confidence estimation, and refinement steps. This could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in meta-cognitive tasks. 2) Explore variations of the RCR method, such as using different prompting strategies for decomposition or refinement, or incorporating external knowledge sources for verification. 3) Investigate the impact of query complexity on RCR performance, potentially leading to a method for adaptively choosing between single-pass and recursive approaches based on task characteristics. 4) Analyze the linguistic and reasoning patterns in cases where RCR succeeds or fails, which could inform future developments in LLM training and prompting strategies for improved calibration."
