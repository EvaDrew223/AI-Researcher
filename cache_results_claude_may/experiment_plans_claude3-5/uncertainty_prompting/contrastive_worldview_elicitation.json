        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to recognize the limits of their knowledge and may confidently assert incorrect information based on biased or incomplete training data.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-perspective confidence estimation, overlooking the potential for multiple valid interpretations.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting for contrasting viewpoints and assessing their relative strengths, we can better gauge the model's true uncertainty and identify potential biases.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Worldview Elicitation, a prompting strategy that asks the LLM to generate responses from multiple, explicitly defined perspectives (e.g., different cultural backgrounds, academic disciplines, or historical periods). The model is then prompted to compare and contrast these viewpoints, highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. We quantify uncertainty based on the diversity and coherence of these generated worldviews, using techniques from information theory and cognitive psychology to measure conceptual distance and alignment.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will test our method on tasks requiring cultural awareness, interdisciplinary knowledge, and historical context from datasets like Culture-QA and TimeQA. We'll compare against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods, evaluating performance on metrics of calibration, diversity of generated viewpoints, and human-judged appropriateness of uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Contrastive Worldview Elicitation: Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models through Multi-Perspective Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to recognize the limits of their knowledge and may confidently assert incorrect information based on biased or incomplete training data. This overconfidence can lead to the propagation of misinformation and poor decision-making in real-world applications. Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on single-perspective confidence estimation, overlooking the potential for multiple valid interpretations and failing to capture the true complexity of many questions.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, such as softmax probabilities or dropout-based approaches, often provide unreliable estimates of model confidence. These methods fail to account for the multifaceted nature of many questions, especially those involving cultural, historical, or interdisciplinary knowledge. By explicitly prompting for contrasting viewpoints and assessing their relative strengths, we can better gauge the model's true uncertainty and identify potential biases. This approach is inspired by human expert behavior, where considering multiple perspectives is often crucial for addressing complex questions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Worldview Elicitation (CWE), a prompting strategy that asks the LLM to generate responses from multiple, explicitly defined perspectives (e.g., different cultural backgrounds, academic disciplines, or historical periods). The method consists of three main steps: 1) Perspective Generation: Prompt the LLM to identify relevant perspectives for the given question. 2) Multi-Perspective Answering: For each identified perspective, generate a detailed answer to the original question. 3) Synthesis and Uncertainty Quantification: Prompt the model to compare and contrast these viewpoints, highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. We then quantify uncertainty based on the diversity and coherence of these generated worldviews, using techniques from information theory and cognitive psychology to measure conceptual distance and alignment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the Culture-QA dataset for questions requiring cultural awareness and the TimeQA dataset for questions involving historical context. Additionally, we will create a subset of interdisciplinary questions from existing datasets like ARC and OpenBookQA.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods as baselines. These include: a) Direct prompting with softmax probabilities, b) Monte Carlo Dropout, c) Ensemble methods using different model checkpoints.",
            "Step 3: CWE Implementation": "Implement the Contrastive Worldview Elicitation method: a) Perspective Generation: Prompt: 'Identify 3-5 relevant perspectives or viewpoints that could provide different insights on the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Multi-Perspective Answering: For each perspective, use the prompt: 'From the perspective of [PERSPECTIVE], answer the following question: [QUESTION]' c) Synthesis and Uncertainty Quantification: Prompt: 'Compare and contrast the answers from different perspectives. Highlight areas of agreement and disagreement. Based on this analysis, how certain are we about the answer to the original question?'",
            "Step 4: Uncertainty Quantification Metrics": "Implement metrics to quantify uncertainty: a) Perspective Diversity: Use embedding-based similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) to calculate the average pairwise distance between perspective answers. b) Answer Coherence: Measure the semantic similarity between the synthesized answer and individual perspective answers. c) Disagreement Score: Calculate the proportion of perspectives that disagree with the majority view. d) Entropy of Perspective Distribution: Compute the entropy of the distribution of perspective confidences.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run baseline methods and record their uncertainty estimates and answer accuracy. b) Apply the CWE method and calculate the uncertainty metrics. c) Compare the performance of CWE against baselines in terms of calibration (using Expected Calibration Error), answer accuracy, and human-judged appropriateness of uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Recruit a small panel of domain experts to evaluate a subset of the model outputs. They will assess: a) The relevance and diversity of generated perspectives. b) The accuracy and nuance of perspective-specific answers. c) The quality of the synthesized answer and uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 8: Analysis and Visualization": "a) Create calibration plots comparing CWE with baseline methods. b) Visualize the distribution of uncertainty estimates across different question types and datasets. c) Analyze correlations between different uncertainty metrics and answer accuracy. d) Identify patterns in cases where CWE significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the significance of the color red in Chinese culture?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "In Chinese culture, the color red is highly significant and is associated with good luck, happiness, and prosperity. It is often used in celebrations, particularly during the Chinese New Year and other festive occasions. Red is believed to ward off evil spirits and bring good fortune. It is also the traditional color for Chinese brides, as it symbolizes good luck and wards off evil. In business and daily life, red is often used to bring luck and success.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "Identify 3-5 relevant perspectives or viewpoints that could provide different insights on the following question: What is the significance of the color red in Chinese culture?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "1. Traditional Chinese cultural perspective\n2. Modern urban Chinese perspective\n3. Western anthropological perspective\n4. Chinese diaspora perspective\n5. Historical evolution perspective",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Multi-Perspective Answering)": "From the perspective of traditional Chinese culture, answer the following question: What is the significance of the color red in Chinese culture?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Multi-Perspective Answering)": "From the traditional Chinese cultural perspective, the color red holds immense significance. It is considered the most auspicious and joyful color, symbolizing good fortune, happiness, and prosperity. Red is believed to ward off evil spirits and bring blessings. In traditional practices, red is prominently used during festivals, especially the Chinese New Year, where red decorations, clothing, and envelopes (hong bao) are ubiquitous. In wedding ceremonies, the bride typically wears a red dress (qipao) and the wedding chamber is decorated with red items. The color is also associated with the element of fire in the Wu Xing (Five Elements) philosophy, representing vitality and energy.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Synthesis and Uncertainty Quantification)": "Compare and contrast the answers from different perspectives. Highlight areas of agreement and disagreement. Based on this analysis, how certain are we about the answer to the original question: What is the significance of the color red in Chinese culture?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Synthesis and Uncertainty Quantification)": "After analyzing the responses from different perspectives, we can identify several areas of agreement and some nuanced differences:\n\nAreas of Agreement:\n1. All perspectives acknowledge the positive associations of red in Chinese culture, particularly its connection to good fortune and happiness.\n2. The use of red in festivals, especially Chinese New Year, is consistently mentioned across perspectives.\n3. The role of red in traditional weddings is widely recognized.\n\nAreas of Disagreement or Nuance:\n1. The traditional perspective emphasizes spiritual beliefs (warding off evil spirits), while the modern urban perspective focuses more on cultural tradition and aesthetics.\n2. The Western anthropological view provides a more analytical approach, comparing the significance of red in Chinese culture to color symbolism in other cultures.\n3. The Chinese diaspora perspective highlights how the significance of red has been maintained but also adapted in overseas Chinese communities.\n4. The historical evolution perspective shows how the meaning of red has changed over time, particularly noting its political associations in the 20th century.\n\nUncertainty Assessment:\nBased on this analysis, we can be highly certain about the core significance of red in Chinese culture as a symbol of good fortune, happiness, and its importance in festivals and weddings. This is consistently reported across all perspectives.\n\nHowever, there is some uncertainty in the following areas:\n1. The extent to which traditional spiritual beliefs about red (e.g., warding off evil spirits) are still prevalent in modern Chinese society.\n2. The degree of variation in the significance of red across different regions of China and among overseas Chinese communities.\n3. The impact of recent historical events (e.g., political associations) on the traditional meanings of red.\n\nOverall, we can be about 80-85% certain about the general significance of red in Chinese culture, with the remaining uncertainty stemming from variations in modern interpretations, regional differences, and ongoing cultural evolution.",
            "explanation": "The Contrastive Worldview Elicitation method provides a more nuanced and comprehensive answer compared to the baseline. It captures various perspectives, acknowledges areas of agreement and disagreement, and provides a more calibrated uncertainty estimate. This approach helps identify potential biases and limitations in the model's knowledge, leading to a more reliable and informative response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Contrastive Worldview Elicitation method does not significantly improve uncertainty quantification or answer quality compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the generated perspectives to understand why they didn't lead to better uncertainty estimates. This could involve categorizing the types of perspectives generated and their relevance to the questions. 2) Investigate whether certain types of questions or domains benefit more from the CWE approach than others. This could lead to insights about when multi-perspective analysis is most useful. 3) Explore alternative methods of combining the multi-perspective answers, such as using a separate LLM as a 'judge' to evaluate the perspectives and estimate uncertainty. 4) Analyze cases where CWE performs poorly to identify potential limitations of the method or biases in the model's knowledge. This could lead to recommendations for improving LLM training or prompting strategies. 5) Compare the CWE method with human expert responses on a subset of questions to understand how well it mimics human reasoning processes and where it falls short. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in handling complex, multi-faceted questions."
