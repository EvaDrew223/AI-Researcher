        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Sampling, a multi-step prompting method: 1) Generate multiple responses to the same query using different temperature settings. 2) Prompt the model to compare and rank these responses, explaining its reasoning. 3) Use another prompt to synthesize these comparisons into a confidence distribution. 4) Finally, prompt the model to translate this distribution into calibrated uncertainty estimates.

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Sampling: A Multi-Step Prompting Method for Calibrated Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately quantify their uncertainty across different domains and tasks. Current approaches typically rely on token probabilities or single-pass confidence scores, which can be unreliable. This project aims to develop a more robust method for uncertainty estimation in large language models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for uncertainty quantification in large language models often fail to capture the full spectrum of possible responses and do not leverage the model's own analytical capabilities. Inspired by the statistical technique of bootstrapping, we propose to leverage the stochastic nature of language model outputs to build a more robust uncertainty estimate. By generating multiple responses and prompting the model to analyze and synthesize these responses, we can potentially achieve more calibrated and reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Spectrum Sampling (CSS), a multi-step prompting method for uncertainty estimation:\n1. Generate multiple responses to the same query using different temperature settings.\n2. Prompt the model to compare and rank these responses, explaining its reasoning.\n3. Use another prompt to synthesize these comparisons into a confidence distribution.\n4. Finally, prompt the model to translate this distribution into calibrated uncertainty estimates.\nThis approach captures a spectrum of possible responses and leverages the model's own analysis capabilities to produce more reliable uncertainty estimates.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select diverse datasets covering factual QA (e.g., TriviaQA), commonsense reasoning (e.g., CommonsenseQA), and mathematical problem-solving (e.g., GSM8K). Ensure each dataset has ground truth answers for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting, Monte Carlo Dropout, and ensemble methods as baselines. For standard prompting, use the model's output probability as the confidence score. For Monte Carlo Dropout, perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled. For ensemble methods, use different model checkpoints or initializations.",
            "Step 3: CSS Implementation": {
                "Step 3.1": "Generate multiple responses: For each query, generate 5 responses using temperature settings [0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3].",
                "Step 3.2": "Comparison and ranking: Prompt the model to compare and rank these responses. Example prompt: 'Given the following responses to the question \"{question}\", please rank them from best to worst, explaining your reasoning for each:\n{responses}\nRanking and explanation:'",
                "Step 3.3": "Synthesize confidence distribution: Prompt the model to synthesize the rankings into a confidence distribution. Example prompt: 'Based on your ranking and explanation of the responses, please provide a confidence distribution for the answer to the question \"{question}\". Express this as percentages for high, medium, and low confidence.'",
                "Step 3.4": "Calibrated uncertainty estimation: Prompt the model to translate the confidence distribution into a calibrated uncertainty estimate. Example prompt: 'Given the confidence distribution {distribution} for the question \"{question}\", please provide a calibrated uncertainty estimate between 0 and 1, where 0 means completely uncertain and 1 means completely certain. Explain your reasoning.'"
            },
            "Step 4: Evaluation": "Evaluate all methods using calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and reliability diagrams. Also compute accuracy and F1 scores to ensure the method doesn't sacrifice performance for better calibration.",
            "Step 5: Analysis": "Compare CSS against baselines across different task types. Analyze how CSS performs on questions with varying difficulty levels. Investigate the relationship between the diversity of generated responses and the final calibrated uncertainty estimate."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "Standard Prompting Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.99)",
                "Monte Carlo Dropout Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.98)",
                "Ensemble Method Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.97)",
                "Explanation": "All baseline methods show very high confidence for this simple factual question, potentially leading to overconfidence in easy cases."
            },
            "Example 2 (CSS Success)": {
                "Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
                "CSS Step 1 (Multiple Responses)": [
                    "The capital of France is Paris.",
                    "Paris is the capital city of France.",
                    "France's capital is Paris, located in the north-central part of the country.",
                    "The capital and most populous city of France is Paris.",
                    "Paris, often called the 'City of Light', serves as the capital of France."
                ],
                "CSS Step 2 (Comparison and Ranking)": "Ranking from best to worst:\n1. France's capital is Paris, located in the north-central part of the country.\n2. Paris, often called the 'City of Light', serves as the capital of France.\n3. The capital and most populous city of France is Paris.\n4. Paris is the capital city of France.\n5. The capital of France is Paris.\nExplanation: The top-ranked response provides the most comprehensive information, including the location. The second and third responses offer additional context. The fourth and fifth responses, while correct, are the most basic.",
                "CSS Step 3 (Confidence Distribution)": "High confidence: 90%, Medium confidence: 10%, Low confidence: 0%",
                "CSS Step 4 (Calibrated Uncertainty)": "Calibrated uncertainty estimate: 0.9\nReasoning: While all responses agree that Paris is the capital of France, and this is a well-known fact, there's always a small chance of error or changes in geopolitical situations. The high agreement across diverse responses and the additional context provided in some answers contribute to the high certainty, but perfect certainty is rarely achievable.",
                "Explanation": "CSS provides a more nuanced uncertainty estimate by considering multiple responses, their diversity, and the model's own analysis of these responses. This approach is less likely to be overconfident in simple cases and can potentially handle more complex queries better."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSS doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can analyze each step of the process to identify potential improvements. For instance, we could investigate whether increasing the number or diversity of generated responses in Step 1 leads to better calibration. We could also experiment with different prompting strategies for the comparison and synthesis steps. Additionally, we could explore combining CSS with other uncertainty estimation methods, such as using CSS to refine initial estimates from Monte Carlo Dropout or ensemble methods. If these modifications don't yield improvements, we could pivot to an analysis paper, examining why different uncertainty estimation methods succeed or fail across various task types and difficulty levels. This could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in self-assessing their confidence and guide future research in this area."
