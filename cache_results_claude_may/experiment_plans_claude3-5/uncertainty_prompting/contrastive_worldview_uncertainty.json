    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to recognize the limits of their knowledge and may confidently assert incorrect information based on biased or incomplete training data.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods often rely on single-perspective prompting or limited few-shot examples to gauge model uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By exposing the model to contrasting worldviews or perspectives on a given topic, we can help it recognize areas of uncertainty and potential bias in its knowledge.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty (CWU), a prompting method that introduces multiple, potentially conflicting perspectives on a topic before asking for a final answer and uncertainty estimate. The process involves: 1) Presenting the main question, 2) Prompting the LLM to generate 3-5 diverse perspectives on the topic, potentially from different experts or cultural viewpoints, 3) Asking the model to critically compare and contrast these perspectives, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement, 4) Requesting a final answer along with a detailed uncertainty assessment that considers the diversity of viewpoints and potential gaps in knowledge.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CWU on datasets that involve controversial or culturally-dependent topics, such as social science QA tasks or ethical dilemmas. We'll compare it to standard prompting and few-shot methods, measuring not only accuracy but also the quality and nuance of uncertainty estimates using human evaluation and newly developed metrics for assessing multi-perspective consideration."

        "Title": "Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models through Multi-Perspective Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to recognize the limits of their knowledge and may confidently assert incorrect information based on biased or incomplete training data. This overconfidence can lead to the propagation of misinformation and poor decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for gauging model uncertainty often rely on single-perspective prompting or limited few-shot examples, which may not adequately capture the complexity and nuance of many real-world topics. By exposing the model to contrasting worldviews or perspectives on a given topic, we can help it recognize areas of uncertainty and potential bias in its knowledge. This approach is inspired by human critical thinking processes, where considering multiple viewpoints often leads to a more nuanced understanding and better calibrated confidence in one's beliefs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty (CWU), a prompting method that introduces multiple, potentially conflicting perspectives on a topic before asking for a final answer and uncertainty estimate. The process involves four main steps: 1) Presenting the main question, 2) Prompting the LLM to generate 3-5 diverse perspectives on the topic, potentially from different experts or cultural viewpoints, 3) Asking the model to critically compare and contrast these perspectives, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement, 4) Requesting a final answer along with a detailed uncertainty assessment that considers the diversity of viewpoints and potential gaps in knowledge.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use datasets that involve controversial or culturally-dependent topics, such as social science QA tasks or ethical dilemmas. Specifically, we will use: 1) The Moral Uncertainty (MU) dataset, which contains ethical dilemmas and human-annotated uncertainty scores. 2) A subset of the Social IQa dataset, focusing on questions with potential cultural variations. 3) A curated set of questions from the TruthfulQA dataset, selecting items that are likely to have multiple valid perspectives.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Direct prompting: Simply ask the question and request an answer with a confidence score. b) Few-shot prompting: Provide 2-3 examples of questions with answers and confidence scores before the target question. c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: Ask the model to think step-by-step before providing an answer and confidence score.",
            "Step 3: CWU Method Implementation": "Implement the CWU method with the following steps: a) Present the main question. b) Prompt for diverse perspectives (e.g., 'Generate 3-5 different viewpoints on this topic from various experts or cultural perspectives.'). c) Ask for comparison and contrast (e.g., 'Compare and contrast these perspectives, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement.'). d) Request final answer and uncertainty assessment (e.g., 'Based on these perspectives, provide your best answer to the original question, along with a detailed uncertainty assessment that considers the diversity of viewpoints and potential gaps in knowledge.').",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: a) Answer accuracy (where applicable). b) Calibration error: comparing model confidence to actual performance. c) Uncertainty quality: human evaluation of the nuance and depth of uncertainty assessments. d) Perspective diversity: measuring the variety of viewpoints generated. e) Bias mitigation: assessing how well the method reduces cultural or ideological bias in responses.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and CWU): a) Generate responses for all questions using both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. b) Calculate accuracy and calibration error metrics. c) Conduct human evaluation for uncertainty quality and bias mitigation. d) For CWU method, also evaluate perspective diversity.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CWU against baselines across all metrics. Conduct statistical significance tests to verify improvements. Analyze how performance varies across different types of questions and topics."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: Is it ethical to use animals for medical research? Please provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A: Yes, it is ethical to use animals for medical research when it is done responsibly and with proper oversight. Animal research has led to numerous medical breakthroughs that have saved countless human lives. However, it's important to minimize animal suffering and use alternatives when possible.\nConfidence Score: 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWU Prompting)": "Q: Is it ethical to use animals for medical research?\n1. Generate 3-5 different viewpoints on this topic from various experts or cultural perspectives.\n2. Compare and contrast these perspectives, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement.\n3. Based on these perspectives, provide your best answer to the original question, along with a detailed uncertainty assessment that considers the diversity of viewpoints and potential gaps in knowledge.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWU Prompting)": "1. Diverse Perspectives:\na) Medical Researcher: 'Animal research is crucial for advancing medical knowledge and developing life-saving treatments. It's ethical when conducted humanely and regulated properly.'\nb) Animal Rights Activist: 'Using animals for research is inherently unethical. Animals cannot consent and often suffer. We should focus on alternative methods.'\nc) Ethicist: 'The ethics of animal research depend on weighing potential benefits against animal welfare. It may be justified for critical research but not for cosmetics or non-essential purposes.'\nd) Indigenous Perspective: 'Many indigenous cultures view animals as equal beings with spirits. Using them for research disrupts natural balance and is disrespectful to their autonomy.'\ne) Utilitarian Philosopher: 'If animal research leads to outcomes that significantly reduce suffering for a large number of humans and animals, it could be considered ethical from a utilitarian standpoint.'\n\n2. Comparison and Contrast:\nAreas of Agreement:\n- All perspectives acknowledge that animal welfare is an important consideration.\n- There's a general consensus that if animal research is conducted, it should be done as humanely as possible.\nAreas of Disagreement:\n- The fundamental right of humans to use animals for research purposes.\n- The validity and necessity of animal research for medical advancements.\n- The extent to which potential human benefits outweigh animal suffering.\n- Cultural and philosophical differences in how animals are viewed in relation to humans.\n\n3. Final Answer and Uncertainty Assessment:\nAnswer: The ethics of using animals for medical research is a complex and contentious issue without a clear consensus. While it has led to significant medical advancements, it also raises serious ethical concerns about animal welfare and rights.\n\nUncertainty Assessment:\n- High uncertainty due to the diversity of valid perspectives and the complexity of weighing different ethical considerations.\n- Cultural variations in how animals are viewed add another layer of uncertainty, as ethical frameworks differ across societies.\n- There's uncertainty about the necessity and effectiveness of animal research compared to alternative methods, which affects the ethical calculus.\n- The long-term consequences of either continuing or stopping animal research are not fully known, adding to the uncertainty.\n- Personal and societal values play a significant role in this ethical question, making it difficult to reach a universally accepted conclusion.\n\nGiven these factors, I would assign a confidence level of 40/100 to any definitive statement about the ethics of animal research. This low confidence reflects the genuine complexity of the issue and the need for ongoing dialogue and careful consideration of multiple perspectives.",
            "Explanation": "The CWU method provides a more nuanced and balanced view of the ethical dilemma. By considering multiple perspectives, it highlights the complexity of the issue and provides a more calibrated uncertainty assessment. The direct prompting method, in contrast, gives a more simplistic and overconfident response that doesn't fully capture the ethical nuances and cultural variations surrounding the topic."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CWU method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated perspectives to understand if the model is producing genuinely diverse viewpoints or if it's repeating similar ideas with different wording. This could lead to insights on improving prompt engineering for perspective generation. 2) Investigate whether the method performs better on certain types of questions or topics, which could inform more targeted applications of the approach. 3) Explore variations of the CWU method, such as changing the number of perspectives generated or altering the way the model is asked to compare and contrast viewpoints. 4) Conduct an in-depth analysis of cases where CWU performs worse than baselines to identify potential weaknesses in the approach. 5) Shift focus to analyzing how exposure to multiple perspectives affects the model's reasoning process, even if it doesn't always lead to better final answers. This could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and potential pathways for improving their reasoning capabilities."
