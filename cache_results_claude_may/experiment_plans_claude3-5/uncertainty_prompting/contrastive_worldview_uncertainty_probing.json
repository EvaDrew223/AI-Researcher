        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize when their knowledge or reasoning is based on specific cultural, historical, or disciplinary perspectives, leading to overconfidence in biased or context-dependent answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on uncertainty within a single worldview or knowledge framework, neglecting the possibility of fundamentally different perspectives on a question.",
        "Motivation": "Many complex questions, especially in social sciences or philosophy, can be approached from multiple valid but contrasting worldviews. A truly calibrated model should express higher uncertainty when faced with such perspective-dependent queries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty Probing (CWUP), a prompting technique that explicitly introduces multiple perspectives to gauge model uncertainty. The method involves: 1) Identifying key worldviews or perspectives relevant to the query domain (e.g., different schools of economic thought for an economics question). 2) Constructing prompts that frame the original query from each of these perspectives. 3) Collecting model responses and confidence estimates for each perspective-specific prompt. 4) Analyzing the divergence in responses and confidence across perspectives. 5) Synthesizing a final uncertainty estimate that reflects both within-perspective confidence and cross-perspective divergence. This approach encourages the model to consider multiple valid frameworks and express appropriate uncertainty when faced with perspective-dependent questions.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will curate a dataset of questions from fields like economics, ethics, and social sciences where multiple valid perspectives exist. We'll compare CWUP against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods, evaluating performance on metrics like calibration error and a new metric we'll term 'perspective-aware uncertainty'. We'll also conduct a human evaluation to assess the quality and insight of the perspective-specific responses generated by CWUP."

        "Title": "Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty Probing: Calibrating LLM Confidence Across Perspectives",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to recognize when their knowledge or reasoning is based on specific cultural, historical, or disciplinary perspectives, leading to overconfidence in biased or context-dependent answers. This is particularly problematic for complex questions in social sciences, philosophy, and other domains where multiple valid but contrasting worldviews exist.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to uncertainty quantification in LLMs typically focus on uncertainty within a single worldview or knowledge framework, neglecting the possibility of fundamentally different perspectives on a question. A truly calibrated model should express higher uncertainty when faced with perspective-dependent queries. By introducing multiple perspectives explicitly, we can encourage LLMs to consider diverse valid frameworks and express appropriate uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Worldview Uncertainty Probing (CWUP), a prompting technique that explicitly introduces multiple perspectives to gauge model uncertainty. The method involves five key steps: 1) Identifying key worldviews or perspectives relevant to the query domain. 2) Constructing prompts that frame the original query from each of these perspectives. 3) Collecting model responses and confidence estimates for each perspective-specific prompt. 4) Analyzing the divergence in responses and confidence across perspectives. 5) Synthesizing a final uncertainty estimate that reflects both within-perspective confidence and cross-perspective divergence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Curation": "Create a dataset of 100-200 questions from fields like economics, ethics, and social sciences where multiple valid perspectives exist. For each question, identify 3-5 relevant worldviews or perspectives. Sources can include academic literature, textbooks, and expert consultations.",
            "Step 2: Perspective-Specific Prompt Construction": "For each question and identified perspective, construct a prompt that frames the query from that specific worldview. Use a consistent template: 'From the perspective of [worldview], consider the following question: [original question]'",
            "Step 3: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as the primary models for evaluation. Also include GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 4: Baseline Prompting": "Implement two baseline prompting methods: (a) Direct prompting: Ask the question directly without mentioning perspectives. (b) Single-perspective uncertainty: Ask the question from a single perspective and request a confidence score.",
            "Step 5: CWUP Implementation": "For each question: (a) Generate responses and confidence scores for each perspective-specific prompt. Use the prompt: 'From the perspective of [worldview], answer the following question and provide a confidence score from 0 to 100: [original question]' (b) Generate a response and confidence score for the original question without perspective framing. (c) Calculate the divergence in responses across perspectives using cosine similarity of embeddings. (d) Synthesize a final uncertainty estimate using a weighted combination of within-perspective confidence and cross-perspective divergence.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: (a) Calibration error: Compare model confidence to human expert ratings. (b) Perspective-aware uncertainty: Measure how well the model's uncertainty correlates with the degree of perspective dependence (as rated by experts). (c) Response diversity: Quantify the variation in responses across perspectives.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Recruit 3-5 domain experts per field to: (a) Rate the quality and insight of perspective-specific responses. (b) Assess the appropriateness of the final uncertainty estimates. (c) Provide ground-truth ratings for the degree of perspective dependence of each question.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare CWUP against baselines on all metrics. Analyze how performance varies across different types of questions and perspectives. Investigate cases where CWUP significantly outperforms or underperforms baselines.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablations to assess the impact of: (a) Number of perspectives used. (b) Different methods of synthesizing the final uncertainty estimate. (c) Variations in perspective-specific prompt wording."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "What economic policy would be most effective for reducing income inequality?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "To reduce income inequality, a progressive taxation system combined with increased investment in education and job training programs would be most effective. This approach addresses both immediate redistribution and long-term opportunity creation. [Confidence: 85%]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWUP; Perspective 1)": "From the perspective of Keynesian economics, consider the following question: What economic policy would be most effective for reducing income inequality?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWUP; Perspective 1)": "From a Keynesian perspective, the most effective policy for reducing income inequality would be a combination of progressive taxation and increased government spending on social programs and public infrastructure. This approach stimulates aggregate demand, creates jobs, and provides a social safety net. [Confidence: 90%]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWUP; Perspective 2)": "From the perspective of neoclassical economics, consider the following question: What economic policy would be most effective for reducing income inequality?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWUP; Perspective 2)": "From a neoclassical economics perspective, the most effective policy for reducing income inequality would focus on removing market distortions and enhancing competition. This could include reducing regulations, lowering barriers to entry for businesses, and improving labor market flexibility. The idea is that a more efficient market will lead to greater overall prosperity and naturally reduce inequality. [Confidence: 75%]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWUP; Perspective 3)": "From the perspective of behavioral economics, consider the following question: What economic policy would be most effective for reducing income inequality?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWUP; Perspective 3)": "From a behavioral economics perspective, the most effective policy for reducing income inequality would leverage insights about human behavior and decision-making. This might include nudges to encourage saving and investment among lower-income groups, designing progressive tax systems that account for loss aversion, and implementing financial education programs that address cognitive biases. [Confidence: 80%]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CWUP; Final Synthesis)": "Given the following perspective-specific responses to the question 'What economic policy would be most effective for reducing income inequality?', synthesize a final answer and provide an overall uncertainty estimate: [Include all perspective-specific responses]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CWUP; Final Synthesis)": "The most effective economic policy for reducing income inequality likely involves a multifaceted approach that draws insights from various economic perspectives. This could include elements of progressive taxation and targeted government spending (Keynesian), market efficiency improvements (neoclassical), and behaviorally-informed interventions. However, the significant variations in proposed solutions across economic schools of thought suggest that there is no clear consensus on the optimal approach. The effectiveness of any policy would depend on specific contextual factors and may vary across different economic environments. [Overall Uncertainty Estimate: 70%]",
            "explanation": "CWUP prompting reveals the perspective-dependent nature of the question, leading to a more nuanced final answer with appropriately higher uncertainty compared to the baseline. The method exposes the model to multiple valid viewpoints, encouraging a more comprehensive and cautious response."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CWUP does not significantly improve uncertainty calibration or response quality, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of how different types of questions and perspectives affect model responses, potentially uncovering insights about LLM knowledge representation and reasoning across domains. 2) Investigate whether CWUP can be used as a data augmentation technique for fine-tuning smaller models to improve their multi-perspective reasoning capabilities. 3) Explore how CWUP can be combined with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to potentially achieve synergistic improvements in reasoning and uncertainty estimation. 4) Develop a new metric for measuring 'perspective-awareness' in LLM responses, which could be valuable for future research in this area even if our specific method doesn't outperform baselines."
