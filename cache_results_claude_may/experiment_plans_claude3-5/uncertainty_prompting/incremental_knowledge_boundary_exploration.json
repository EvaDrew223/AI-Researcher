        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in areas where their knowledge is limited or fragmented.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically assess confidence based on the model's direct output for a given query, without systematically probing the extent of its knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "By incrementally exploring the boundaries of the model's knowledge related to a query, we can more accurately gauge its uncertainty and identify potential areas of overconfidence.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Incremental Knowledge Boundary Exploration (IKBE): 1) Core Query Assessment: Start with the original query and obtain an initial confidence estimate. 2) Knowledge Expansion: Iteratively prompt the model to generate increasingly specific or tangential questions related to the original query. 3) Boundary Detection: For each generated question, prompt the model to assess its confidence. Track where confidence begins to decrease significantly. 4) Uncertainty Refinement: Based on the detected knowledge boundaries, prompt the model to reassess its uncertainty for the original query, explicitly considering the extent and limitations of its relevant knowledge.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare IKBE with standard confidence elicitation methods on a range of general knowledge and specialized domain questions, evaluating improvements in calibration and the ability to identify true knowledge boundaries."

        "Title": "Incremental Knowledge Boundary Exploration for Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfidence in areas where their knowledge is limited or fragmented. This can result in unreliable outputs and potential misinformation, particularly in critical applications such as healthcare, finance, or legal domains.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically assess confidence based on the model's direct output for a given query, without systematically probing the extent of its knowledge. By incrementally exploring the boundaries of the model's knowledge related to a query, we can more accurately gauge its uncertainty and identify potential areas of overconfidence. This method leverages the model's own capabilities to generate related questions and assess its confidence, potentially offering a more nuanced and accurate representation of the model's knowledge boundaries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Incremental Knowledge Boundary Exploration (IKBE), a multi-step prompting method to better quantify uncertainty in LLMs:\n1. Core Query Assessment: Start with the original query and obtain an initial confidence estimate.\n2. Knowledge Expansion: Iteratively prompt the model to generate increasingly specific or tangential questions related to the original query.\n3. Boundary Detection: For each generated question, prompt the model to assess its confidence. Track where confidence begins to decrease significantly.\n4. Uncertainty Refinement: Based on the detected knowledge boundaries, prompt the model to reassess its uncertainty for the original query, explicitly considering the extent and limitations of its relevant knowledge.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from existing datasets such as TruthfulQA, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions. Ensure a mix of general knowledge and specialized domain questions. Create a balanced set of 1000 questions, with known ground truth answers and varying difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Method Implementation": "Implement standard confidence elicitation methods:\na) Direct Confidence: Prompt the model to provide an answer and a confidence score (0-100%).\nb) Calibrated Confidence: Use temperature scaling or Platt scaling on the model's logits to obtain calibrated probabilities.\nPrompt template for Direct Confidence:\n\"Question: {question}\nProvide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%) in the following format:\nAnswer: [Your answer]\nConfidence: [0-100]%\"",
            "Step 3: IKBE Implementation": "Implement the IKBE method with the following steps:\na) Core Query Assessment:\nPrompt: \"Question: {question}\nProvide your answer and initial confidence level (0-100%):\nAnswer: [Your answer]\nInitial Confidence: [0-100]%\"\nb) Knowledge Expansion:\nPrompt: \"Based on the question '{question}', generate 5 increasingly specific or tangential questions that explore the boundaries of knowledge related to this topic.\"\nc) Boundary Detection:\nFor each generated question, use the prompt:\n\"Question: {generated_question}\nProvide your answer and confidence level (0-100%):\nAnswer: [Your answer]\nConfidence: [0-100]%\"\nd) Uncertainty Refinement:\nPrompt: \"Given the original question '{question}' and the exploration of related questions and their confidence levels, reassess your uncertainty for the original question. Provide your final answer and refined confidence level, explaining your reasoning:\nFinal Answer: [Your answer]\nRefined Confidence: [0-100]%\nReasoning: [Your explanation]\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for the experiments. If resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset:\na) Run the baseline methods and record the answers and confidence scores.\nb) Run the IKBE method, recording all intermediate steps (generated questions, confidence scores) and the final refined answer and confidence.\nc) Store all results in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics:\na) Accuracy: Percentage of correct answers for both baseline and IKBE methods.\nb) Calibration Error: Calculate Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for both methods.\nc) Confidence Distribution: Compare the distribution of confidence scores between baseline and IKBE.\nd) Knowledge Boundary Analysis: Analyze at which point in the generated questions the confidence starts to decrease significantly.\ne) Refinement Impact: Measure the change in confidence between initial and refined assessments in IKBE.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Visualization": "a) Create plots comparing accuracy vs. confidence for baseline and IKBE methods.\nb) Generate reliability diagrams to visualize calibration.\nc) Visualize the knowledge boundary exploration process for sample questions.\nd) Conduct statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to assess the significance of improvements in calibration and accuracy.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of each component of IKBE:\na) Vary the number of generated questions in the Knowledge Expansion step.\nb) Compare different prompts for the Uncertainty Refinement step.\nc) Analyze the effect of including or excluding the reasoning step in the final refinement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Question: What is the capital of France?\nProvide your answer and your confidence level (0-100%) in the following format:\nAnswer: [Your answer]\nConfidence: [0-100]%",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Answer: Paris\nConfidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Core Query Assessment)": "Question: What is the capital of France?\nProvide your answer and initial confidence level (0-100%):\nAnswer: [Your answer]\nInitial Confidence: [0-100]%",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Core Query Assessment)": "Answer: Paris\nInitial Confidence: 99%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Knowledge Expansion)": "Based on the question 'What is the capital of France?', generate 5 increasingly specific or tangential questions that explore the boundaries of knowledge related to this topic.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Knowledge Expansion)": "1. When did Paris become the capital of France?\n2. What was the capital of France before Paris?\n3. How many times has the capital of France changed throughout history?\n4. What is the population of Paris as of the most recent census?\n5. How does the French government system distribute power between Paris and other regions?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Boundary Detection)": "Question: How does the French government system distribute power between Paris and other regions?\nProvide your answer and confidence level (0-100%):\nAnswer: [Your answer]\nConfidence: [0-100]%",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Boundary Detection)": "Answer: France has a decentralized system where power is distributed between the central government in Paris and regional and local authorities. The country is divided into regions, departments, and communes, each with their own elected officials and certain autonomy. However, the national government in Paris still maintains significant control over major policy decisions and national affairs.\nConfidence: 85%",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Uncertainty Refinement)": "Given the original question 'What is the capital of France?' and the exploration of related questions and their confidence levels, reassess your uncertainty for the original question. Provide your final answer and refined confidence level, explaining your reasoning:\nFinal Answer: [Your answer]\nRefined Confidence: [0-100]%\nReasoning: [Your explanation]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Uncertainty Refinement)": "Final Answer: Paris\nRefined Confidence: 99.9%\nReasoning: Through the exploration of related questions, I've confirmed my knowledge about Paris being the capital of France. While my confidence in some historical details and specific governmental structures decreased slightly, the core fact about Paris being the current capital remains extremely certain. The exploration process didn't reveal any information that would cast doubt on this fundamental fact, thus slightly increasing my already high confidence.",
            "explanation": "The IKBE method allows for a more nuanced exploration of the model's knowledge boundaries. While the baseline method might give a high confidence score without further exploration, IKBE probes deeper, potentially revealing areas of uncertainty in related topics. In this case, the model maintained high confidence in the core fact but demonstrated awareness of its limitations in more specific historical and governmental details. This process provides a more comprehensive assessment of the model's knowledge and uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IKBE method doesn't significantly improve uncertainty quantification compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why IKBE fails to improve calibration. This might involve categorizing questions based on topic, difficulty, or the pattern of confidence changes during the knowledge expansion phase. We could then use these insights to develop a more sophisticated version of IKBE that adapts its strategy based on question characteristics. Alternatively, we could shift focus to analyzing how different types of questions lead to different patterns of knowledge boundary exploration, potentially revealing insights about the structure of knowledge in LLMs. This could lead to a paper on the topology of knowledge in language models as revealed through incremental exploration. Another direction could be to investigate how the generated questions themselves could be used as a form of explanation or justification for the model's confidence, turning this into a study on interpretable uncertainty quantification."
