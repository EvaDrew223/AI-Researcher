        "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas where their knowledge is limited or uncertain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on the model's internal confidence scores or simple prompting techniques, which may not effectively probe the limits of the model's knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically exploring and challenging the boundaries of a model's knowledge, we can obtain a more accurate assessment of its true capabilities and uncertainties.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Knowledge Boundary Exploration (AKBE), an iterative prompting technique that progressively probes the limits of a model's knowledge. The method begins with a base question and then generates a series of increasingly specific or challenging follow-up questions. These questions are designed to explore the depth and breadth of the model's knowledge on the topic. At each step, the model is asked to provide an answer and a confidence score. The process continues until the model expresses low confidence or inability to answer. AKBE then analyzes the pattern of confidence scores and the point at which the model's knowledge breaks down to calibrate its overall confidence on the topic.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate AKBE against standard prompting and existing confidence calibration methods on a range of knowledge-intensive tasks, including specialized domain questioning (e.g., advanced physics, niche historical events) and open-ended reasoning tasks. Use metrics such as calibration curves, expected calibration error, and knowledge boundary detection accuracy."

        "Title": "Adversarial Knowledge Boundary Exploration (AKBE): Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to accurately identify the boundaries of their knowledge, leading to overconfident responses in areas where their knowledge is limited or uncertain. This issue can result in the propagation of misinformation and reduce the reliability of LLM-based systems in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to confidence calibration in LLMs typically rely on the model's internal confidence scores or simple prompting techniques, which may not effectively probe the limits of the model's knowledge. By systematically exploring and challenging the boundaries of a model's knowledge through an iterative prompting technique, we can obtain a more accurate assessment of its true capabilities and uncertainties. This approach leverages the model's own reasoning abilities to generate increasingly specific or challenging follow-up questions, potentially leading to more robust and reliable confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Knowledge Boundary Exploration (AKBE), an iterative prompting technique that progressively probes the limits of a model's knowledge.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of questions from knowledge-intensive datasets such as TruthfulQA, NaturalQuestions, and TriviaQA. Ensure a mix of topics including science, history, current events, and specialized domains.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard prompting and existing confidence calibration methods as baselines. These should include: a) Direct prompting, b) Temperature scaling, c) Ensemble methods.",
            "Step 3: AKBE Implementation": "Implement the AKBE method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial question answering, b) Follow-up question generation, c) Iterative answering and confidence scoring, d) Stopping criterion implementation, e) Confidence calibration based on the exploration pattern.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the main experiments. Additionally, use open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments on the prepared dataset using both baseline methods and AKBE. Collect model outputs, confidence scores, and exploration patterns for each question.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance using metrics such as calibration curves, expected calibration error (ECE), and knowledge boundary detection accuracy. Compare AKBE results with baseline methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Analyze the results to understand: a) How AKBE affects confidence calibration compared to baselines, b) The effectiveness of the follow-up question generation, c) The relationship between exploration depth and calibration accuracy.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of AKBE, such as the number of follow-up questions, the stopping criterion, and the confidence calibration method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 0.99",
            "AKBE Prompt Input (Initial Question)": "Q: What is the capital of France?",
            "AKBE Prompt Expected Output (Initial Answer)": "A: The capital of France is Paris. Confidence: 0.99",
            "AKBE Prompt Input (Follow-up Question 1)": "Generate a more specific follow-up question about the capital of France:",
            "AKBE Prompt Expected Output (Follow-up Question 1)": "Q: In which arrondissement of Paris is the Eiffel Tower located?",
            "AKBE Prompt Input (Answer to Follow-up 1)": "Q: In which arrondissement of Paris is the Eiffel Tower located?",
            "AKBE Prompt Expected Output (Answer to Follow-up 1)": "A: The Eiffel Tower is located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. Confidence: 0.95",
            "AKBE Prompt Input (Follow-up Question 2)": "Generate an even more specific follow-up question about the Eiffel Tower's location:",
            "AKBE Prompt Expected Output (Follow-up Question 2)": "Q: What is the exact address of the Eiffel Tower, including the street name and number?",
            "AKBE Prompt Input (Answer to Follow-up 2)": "Q: What is the exact address of the Eiffel Tower, including the street name and number?",
            "AKBE Prompt Expected Output (Answer to Follow-up 2)": "A: I'm not entirely certain of the exact address, but I believe it's located on Champ de Mars. I don't know the specific street number. Confidence: 0.6",
            "Explanation": "This example demonstrates how AKBE progressively probes deeper into the model's knowledge, revealing a more accurate picture of its confidence levels. While the model was highly confident about Paris being the capital of France, its confidence decreased as the questions became more specific, eventually reaching a point where it acknowledged uncertainty about the exact address of the Eiffel Tower."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If AKBE does not significantly improve confidence calibration compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways. First, we could conduct a detailed analysis of the generated follow-up questions to understand if they are effectively probing the model's knowledge boundaries. This could lead to insights on how to improve question generation strategies. Second, we could investigate the relationship between the complexity of follow-up questions and the model's confidence scores, potentially revealing patterns in how LLMs assess their own knowledge. Third, we could explore combining AKBE with other calibration methods, such as temperature scaling or ensemble techniques, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Lastly, we could shift focus to analyzing how different types of questions (e.g., factual vs. reasoning-based) affect the model's confidence calibration, potentially leading to a taxonomy of question types and their impact on LLM uncertainty quantification."
