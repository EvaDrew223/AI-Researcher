        "Problem": "LLMs often provide point estimates of confidence that fail to capture the full range of uncertainty, especially for complex or ambiguous queries.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single confidence scores or simple binary uncertainty classifications.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically perturbing the input prompt, we can explore a spectrum of confidence levels and gain a more nuanced understanding of the model's uncertainty landscape.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Spectrum Analysis via Prompt Perturbation (CSAPP), a method that: 1) Takes an initial query and generates a series of perturbed versions by adding, removing, or modifying key information. 2) Prompts the LLM to answer each perturbed query and provide a confidence score. 3) Constructs a confidence spectrum by analyzing how the model's certainty changes across perturbations. 4) Identifies critical information that significantly impacts confidence. 5) Aggregates the spectrum into a rich uncertainty representation, including median confidence, variance, and sensitivity to specific perturbations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CSAPP against standard confidence estimation techniques on datasets with varying levels of ambiguity and completeness. Assess performance using metrics that capture the richness of uncertainty quantification, such as confidence distribution KL-divergence and perturbation sensitivity scores."

        "Title": "Confidence Spectrum Analysis via Prompt Perturbation (CSAPP): Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide point estimates of confidence that fail to capture the full range of uncertainty, especially for complex or ambiguous queries. This limitation can lead to overconfident predictions and unreliable decision-making in critical applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically focus on single confidence scores or simple binary uncertainty classifications, which do not fully capture the nuanced uncertainty landscape of LLMs. By systematically perturbing the input prompt, we can explore a spectrum of confidence levels and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's uncertainty. This approach leverages the LLM's own capabilities to generate a richer uncertainty representation without requiring access to model internals or extensive retraining.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Confidence Spectrum Analysis via Prompt Perturbation (CSAPP), a method that: 1) Takes an initial query and generates a series of perturbed versions by adding, removing, or modifying key information. 2) Prompts the LLM to answer each perturbed query and provide a confidence score. 3) Constructs a confidence spectrum by analyzing how the model's certainty changes across perturbations. 4) Identifies critical information that significantly impacts confidence. 5) Aggregates the spectrum into a rich uncertainty representation, including median confidence, variance, and sensitivity to specific perturbations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets with varying levels of ambiguity and completeness. We will use: a) TruthfulQA for factual questions, b) AmbigQA for ambiguous queries, and c) GSM8K for math word problems. Each dataset should have at least 1000 examples for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard confidence estimation techniques as baselines: a) Direct confidence scoring: Prompt the LLM to provide a single confidence score for each query. b) Binary uncertainty classification: Prompt the LLM to classify each query as 'certain' or 'uncertain'. c) Monte Carlo Dropout (if using open-source models): Apply dropout at inference time and calculate the variance of multiple forward passes.",
            "Step 3: CSAPP Implementation": "a) Develop a prompt perturbation function that generates 5-10 variations of each input query by: adding irrelevant information, removing key details, paraphrasing, or introducing ambiguity. b) Create a prompting template that asks the LLM to answer the query and provide a confidence score (0-100). c) For each original query and its perturbations, collect LLM responses and confidence scores. d) Implement functions to analyze the confidence spectrum: calculate median, variance, and identify perturbations that cause significant confidence changes.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API as the primary models for evaluation. If computational resources allow, also include Claude from Anthropic and Gemini from Google as additional models for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Confidence distribution KL-divergence: Compare the generated confidence spectrum to human-annotated uncertainty distributions (collect annotations for a subset of 100 examples per dataset). b) Perturbation sensitivity score: Measure the average change in confidence across perturbations. c) Calibration error: Compare the model's confidence to its actual accuracy across confidence buckets. d) Decision quality: Assess how often the model's highest confidence answer matches human preferences (collect annotations for a subset of examples).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "a) Run baseline methods and CSAPP on all datasets for each selected model. b) For each query, generate the confidence spectrum and aggregate uncertainty metrics. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both baselines and CSAPP. d) Analyze results to identify patterns in how different types of perturbations affect confidence across question types and models.",
            "Step 7: Analysis and Visualization": "a) Create visualizations of confidence spectra for representative examples. b) Plot aggregate metrics (e.g., median confidence, variance) across datasets and models. c) Analyze the relationship between perturbation types and confidence changes. d) Identify cases where CSAPP provides more informative uncertainty estimates than baselines.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "a) Vary the number of perturbations (3, 5, 10, 15) to analyze the trade-off between computational cost and uncertainty estimation quality. b) Compare different aggregation methods for the confidence spectrum (e.g., mean vs. median, including vs. excluding outliers). c) Evaluate the impact of different prompting strategies for eliciting confidence scores."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: Who was the first person to walk on the moon? Please also provide a confidence score from 0 to 100 for your answer.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. Confidence score: 95",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSAPP Step 1: Generate Perturbations)": "Generate 5 perturbations of the following question, including adding irrelevant information, removing key details, paraphrasing, and introducing ambiguity: 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSAPP Step 1: Generate Perturbations)": "1. Who was the first human to set foot on the lunar surface?\n2. During the space race, which astronaut made history by walking on the moon?\n3. Neil Armstrong was an American astronaut. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\n4. Who walked on the moon?\n5. Some people believe the moon landing was faked. Who supposedly first walked on the moon?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSAPP Step 2: Collect Responses and Confidence Scores)": "Q: Who was the first human to set foot on the lunar surface? Please provide your answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSAPP Step 2: Collect Responses and Confidence Scores)": "A: Neil Armstrong was the first human to set foot on the lunar surface. Confidence score: 98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CSAPP Step 3: Analyze Confidence Spectrum)": "Given the following confidence scores for perturbations of the question 'Who was the first person to walk on the moon?', calculate the median confidence, variance, and identify any perturbations that caused significant changes in confidence:\n1. 98\n2. 95\n3. 97\n4. 90\n5. 85",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CSAPP Step 3: Analyze Confidence Spectrum)": "Median confidence: 95\nVariance: 25.5\nSignificant changes in confidence:\n- Perturbation 4 (removing key details) reduced confidence by 8 points\n- Perturbation 5 (introducing ambiguity) reduced confidence by 13 points",
            "explanation": "CSAPP provides a more nuanced view of the model's uncertainty by analyzing how confidence changes across perturbations. In this example, we see that introducing ambiguity or removing key details significantly reduces the model's confidence, which is valuable information not captured by the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CSAPP does not significantly outperform baselines in uncertainty quantification, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of how different types of perturbations affect confidence across various question types and models. This could provide insights into model behavior and potential weaknesses. 2) Investigate whether combining CSAPP with other uncertainty estimation techniques (e.g., ensemble methods or calibration techniques) yields better results. 3) Explore using the confidence spectrum to improve downstream tasks, such as selective prediction or active learning, even if the raw uncertainty estimates are not significantly better. 4) Analyze cases where CSAPP performs poorly to identify potential improvements to the perturbation generation process or confidence aggregation methods."
