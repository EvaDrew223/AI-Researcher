        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to balance precision and recall in their responses, leading to either overly confident but narrow answers or comprehensive but uncertain ones.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall confidence estimation without explicitly addressing the precision-recall tradeoff in language model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By iteratively refining responses to balance precision and recall, we can achieve more calibrated confidence estimates that accurately reflect the model's knowledge boundaries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Precision-Recall Balancing (IPRB), a prompting technique that guides the model through a series of refinement steps to optimize the precision-recall tradeoff. The process involves: 1) Initial Response: 'Provide a concise answer to the following question: [QUESTION]' 2) Precision Analysis: 'Evaluate the precision of your previous answer. Identify any statements you're not entirely certain about.' 3) Recall Expansion: 'Expand your answer to include additional relevant information, even if you're less confident about it. Use qualifying language to indicate varying levels of certainty.' 4) Precision-Recall Scoring: 'Rate your previous response on a scale of 1-10 for both precision and recall. Explain your ratings.' 5) Balanced Refinement: 'Refine your answer to improve the lower of the two scores while maintaining the higher score.' 6) Iteration: Repeat steps 4-5 until the precision and recall scores converge or a maximum number of iterations is reached. 7) Final Calibration: 'Provide a final answer with explicit confidence levels for different parts of your response. Express an overall confidence percentage and explain how the precision-recall balance influences your uncertainty assessment.'",

        "Title": "Iterative Precision-Recall Balancing: Calibrating Confidence in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to balance precision and recall in their responses, leading to either overly confident but narrow answers or comprehensive but uncertain ones. This imbalance results in poorly calibrated confidence estimates that do not accurately reflect the model's knowledge boundaries.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall confidence estimation without explicitly addressing the precision-recall tradeoff in language model outputs. By iteratively refining responses to balance precision and recall, we can achieve more calibrated confidence estimates that accurately reflect the model's knowledge boundaries. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to assess and improve its outputs, potentially leading to more reliable and informative responses across a wide range of tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Precision-Recall Balancing (IPRB), a prompting technique that guides the model through a series of refinement steps to optimize the precision-recall tradeoff. The process involves seven key steps: 1) Initial Response, 2) Precision Analysis, 3) Recall Expansion, 4) Precision-Recall Scoring, 5) Balanced Refinement, 6) Iteration, and 7) Final Calibration. This method aims to produce responses with explicit confidence levels for different parts of the answer, expressing an overall confidence percentage and explaining how the precision-recall balance influences the uncertainty assessment.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose diverse datasets that cover a range of question-answering tasks, including factual knowledge (e.g., TriviaQA), open-ended reasoning (e.g., ARC-Challenge), and multi-hop inference (e.g., HotpotQA). These datasets should have well-defined ground truth answers to facilitate evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API as the primary models for evaluation. Additionally, include Claude from Anthropic as a comparison point.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting (direct question answering), 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and 3) Self-consistency with CoT. For each baseline, use few-shot examples in the prompt to guide the model's response format.",
            "Step 4: IPRB Implementation": "Implement the Iterative Precision-Recall Balancing method with the following steps: a) Initial Response: 'Provide a concise answer to the following question: [QUESTION]' b) Precision Analysis: 'Evaluate the precision of your previous answer. Identify any statements you're not entirely certain about.' c) Recall Expansion: 'Expand your answer to include additional relevant information, even if you're less confident about it. Use qualifying language to indicate varying levels of certainty.' d) Precision-Recall Scoring: 'Rate your previous response on a scale of 1-10 for both precision and recall. Explain your ratings.' e) Balanced Refinement: 'Refine your answer to improve the lower of the two scores while maintaining the higher score.' f) Iteration: Repeat steps d-e until the precision and recall scores converge or a maximum of 3 iterations is reached. g) Final Calibration: 'Provide a final answer with explicit confidence levels for different parts of your response. Express an overall confidence percentage and explain how the precision-recall balance influences your uncertainty assessment.'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: 1) Answer Accuracy: Compare the final answers against ground truth. 2) Calibration Error: Measure the difference between the model's expressed confidence and its actual accuracy. 3) Precision-Recall AUC: Calculate the area under the precision-recall curve based on the model's confidence levels. 4) Information Content: Assess the amount of relevant information provided in the answers using ROUGE-L and BLEU scores against reference answers.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and collect their outputs. b) Run the IPRB method and collect outputs for each iteration and the final calibrated response. c) Apply the evaluation metrics to both baseline and IPRB outputs. d) Record the number of iterations needed for convergence in IPRB.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Perform the following analyses: a) Compare IPRB performance against baselines across all metrics. b) Analyze how precision and recall scores evolve through IPRB iterations. c) Examine the relationship between expressed confidence and actual accuracy. d) Assess the impact of IPRB on answer comprehensiveness and correctness. e) Investigate any patterns in types of questions or domains where IPRB shows the most improvement.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each IPRB component: a) Remove the Precision Analysis step. b) Remove the Recall Expansion step. c) Vary the maximum number of iterations. d) Use different prompts for each step to assess prompt sensitivity."

            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPRB; Step 1: Initial Response)": "Provide a concise answer to the following question: What is the capital of France, and when was the Eiffel Tower constructed?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPRB; Step 1: Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was constructed in 1889.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPRB; Step 2: Precision Analysis)": "Evaluate the precision of your previous answer. Identify any statements you're not entirely certain about.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPRB; Step 2: Precision Analysis)": "I'm highly confident that Paris is the capital of France. I'm less certain about the exact year of the Eiffel Tower's construction, though I believe 1889 is correct.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPRB; Step 3: Recall Expansion)": "Expand your answer to include additional relevant information, even if you're less confident about it. Use qualifying language to indicate varying levels of certainty.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPRB; Step 3: Recall Expansion)": "The capital of France is definitely Paris. The Eiffel Tower was most likely constructed in 1889, though I'm not 100% certain of this date. It was built for the 1889 World's Fair, which I'm fairly confident about. The tower is named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built it, though I'm less sure about the specifics of his involvement. I believe the construction took about two years, but I'm not entirely certain of this timeframe.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPRB; Step 4: Precision-Recall Scoring)": "Rate your previous response on a scale of 1-10 for both precision and recall. Explain your ratings.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPRB; Step 4: Precision-Recall Scoring)": "Precision: 8/10 - Most of the information provided is accurate, but there's some uncertainty about the exact construction date and timeframe. Recall: 7/10 - The response covers the main points and some additional context, but there could be more relevant details about the Eiffel Tower's construction and significance.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPRB; Step 5: Balanced Refinement)": "Refine your answer to improve the lower of the two scores (recall) while maintaining the higher score (precision).",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPRB; Step 5: Balanced Refinement)": "Paris is undoubtedly the capital of France. The Eiffel Tower, one of Paris's most iconic landmarks, was constructed for the 1889 World's Fair. While I'm confident about this purpose, I'm less certain about some specifics. The construction likely began in 1887 and was completed in 1889, but I'm not entirely sure of these dates. The tower is named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company was responsible for its design and construction. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world, standing at 324 meters (1,063 feet), though I'm more confident about its current height than its original height.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IPRB; Step 7: Final Calibration)": "Provide a final answer with explicit confidence levels for different parts of your response. Express an overall confidence percentage and explain how the precision-recall balance influences your uncertainty assessment.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IPRB; Step 7: Final Calibration)": "Final Answer with Confidence Levels:\n1. Paris is the capital of France. (Confidence: 100%)\n2. The Eiffel Tower was constructed for the 1889 World's Fair. (Confidence: 95%)\n3. Construction likely began in 1887 and was completed in 1889. (Confidence: 80%)\n4. The tower is named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built it. (Confidence: 90%)\n5. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world upon completion. (Confidence: 85%)\n6. The tower currently stands at 324 meters (1,063 feet). (Confidence: 95%)\n\nOverall Confidence: 90%\n\nExplanation of Uncertainty Assessment:\nThe precision-recall balance influences my uncertainty assessment by highlighting areas where I have high confidence (such as Paris being the capital and the Eiffel Tower's connection to the World's Fair) versus areas where I'm less certain (like the exact construction dates). By expanding the recall to include more details about the tower's history and specifications, I've provided a more comprehensive answer, but this has also introduced some elements with lower confidence. The overall confidence of 90% reflects a balance between the high-precision core facts and the additional recall-oriented details that have slightly lower individual confidence levels.",
            "explanation": "The IPRB method guides the model through a process of self-analysis and refinement, resulting in a more nuanced and calibrated response compared to standard prompting. The final output not only provides more information but also explicitly communicates varying levels of confidence for different parts of the answer, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the model's knowledge and uncertainties."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the IPRB method doesn't significantly improve performance over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where and why IPRB fails to improve responses. This could involve categorizing errors (e.g., factual mistakes, logical inconsistencies, or misinterpretations of confidence levels) and analyzing their frequencies across different prompting methods. 2) Investigate the relationship between the number of iterations and performance improvement. If performance plateaus or degrades after a certain number of iterations, this could provide insights into optimal stopping criteria for iterative refinement methods. 3) Explore the impact of different prompting strategies for each IPRB step. We could experiment with various phrasings and instructions to see which ones lead to the most effective self-analysis and refinement. 4) Analyze the model's ability to accurately assess its own precision and recall. If there's a significant discrepancy between the model's self-assessment and actual performance, this could lead to interesting findings about LLMs' meta-cognitive capabilities. 5) Compare IPRB's performance across different types of questions or domains to identify where it's most effective. This could help in developing targeted prompting strategies for specific types of tasks. 6) Investigate how IPRB affects the diversity of responses. If it consistently narrows down to similar answers across multiple runs, this could indicate limitations in the method's ability to explore the full space of possible responses. By pursuing these alternative analyses, we can still derive valuable insights about LLM behavior, self-assessment capabilities, and the effectiveness of iterative prompting techniques, even if the original hypothesis about IPRB's superiority is not supported."
