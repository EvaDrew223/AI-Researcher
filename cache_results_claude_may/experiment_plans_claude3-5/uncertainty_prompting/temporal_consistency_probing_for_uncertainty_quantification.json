    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often provide inconsistent uncertainty estimates when asked similar questions across different contexts or time frames.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on improving uncertainty estimates for individual queries without considering temporal consistency.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of temporal consistency in human decision-making, we aim to improve model calibration by probing for consistency across time-shifted scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Consistency Probing (TCP), a novel prompting technique that leverages time-shifted versions of queries to refine uncertainty estimates. The process works as follows: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence score for the given input. 2) Create multiple time-shifted versions of the original query (e.g., 'What will be true in 5 years?', 'What was true 5 years ago?'). 3) Elicit responses and confidence scores for each time-shifted query. 4) Prompt the model to analyze the consistency of its responses and confidence levels across different time frames. 5) Instruct the model to reconcile any inconsistencies and provide a refined confidence estimate for the original query, explicitly accounting for temporal factors. 6) Optionally, repeat the process with different time scales to further refine the estimate. This method encourages the model to consider the temporal stability of its knowledge and adjust its confidence accordingly.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare TCP with standard uncertainty quantification methods on a range of tasks including future prediction, historical fact-checking, and trend analysis. Evaluate both the accuracy of predictions and the calibration of uncertainty estimates across different time scales. Develop new metrics to assess temporal consistency in confidence estimation."

        "Title": "Temporal Consistency Probing: Improving Uncertainty Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often provide inconsistent uncertainty estimates when asked similar questions across different contexts or time frames. This inconsistency undermines the reliability of their confidence scores, which is crucial for many real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on improving uncertainty estimates for individual queries without considering temporal consistency. Inspired by the concept of temporal consistency in human decision-making, we aim to improve model calibration by probing for consistency across time-shifted scenarios. This approach leverages the model's ability to reason about temporal relationships and encourages it to provide more coherent and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of questions from diverse domains that are sensitive to temporal changes. Include questions from fields such as technology, politics, science, and economics. Ensure a mix of questions with varying degrees of temporal sensitivity. For each question, create a ground truth label indicating the correct answer and a human-annotated confidence score.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement standard uncertainty quantification methods as baselines: a) Direct prompting: Ask the model to provide an answer and a confidence score. b) Calibrated softmax: Use temperature scaling on the model's output logits. c) Monte Carlo Dropout: Perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled.",
            "Step 3: TCP Implementation": "Implement the Temporal Consistency Probing method: a) For each question, generate time-shifted versions (e.g., -5 years, +5 years, -10 years, +10 years). b) Prompt the model to answer each version and provide confidence scores. c) Implement the reconciliation step where the model analyzes temporal consistency and refines its estimate.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for the experiments. These models provide good performance and allow for complex prompting strategies.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Calibration error (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, Maximum Calibration Error). b) Brier score. c) Temporal consistency score (a new metric measuring the coherence of predictions across time shifts). d) Answer accuracy.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each question in the dataset: a) Apply all baseline methods and record their predictions and confidence scores. b) Apply TCP and record its predictions, confidence scores, and intermediate outputs. c) Calculate all evaluation metrics for each method.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare TCP against baselines using the defined metrics. b) Analyze how TCP performs on questions with different degrees of temporal sensitivity. c) Investigate cases where TCP significantly improves or degrades performance compared to baselines. d) Examine the model's reasoning process during the reconciliation step.",

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Q: What is the current state of quantum computing technology? Please provide an answer and a confidence score from 0 to 100.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A: Quantum computing technology is currently in an early stage of development. While there have been significant advancements in recent years, practical, large-scale quantum computers are not yet available for general use. Several companies and research institutions have developed small-scale quantum processors with a limited number of qubits, but these are primarily used for research and proof-of-concept demonstrations. The field is progressing rapidly, with improvements in qubit coherence times, error correction, and quantum algorithms. However, significant challenges remain in scaling up the number of qubits while maintaining their stability and reducing error rates. Confidence score: 85",

            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP Step 2: Time-shifted Queries)": "Please answer the following time-shifted versions of the original question, providing a confidence score for each:\n1. What was the state of quantum computing technology 5 years ago?\n2. What will likely be the state of quantum computing technology 5 years from now?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP Step 2: Time-shifted Queries)": "1. State of quantum computing 5 years ago (2018):\nIn 2018, quantum computing was still in its early stages, with fewer qubits and less stability than today. IBM and Google were among the leading companies working on quantum processors, with IBM's 50-qubit system and Google's 72-qubit Bristlecone processor being notable achievements. However, these systems were still prone to errors and decoherence, limiting their practical applications. Quantum supremacy had not yet been achieved, and most work was focused on improving qubit quality and developing error correction techniques. Confidence score: 80\n\n2. Likely state of quantum computing 5 years from now (2028):\nBy 2028, it's likely that quantum computing will have made significant progress. We may see quantum processors with thousands of qubits, improved error correction, and longer coherence times. Quantum supremacy demonstrations will likely be more common across various algorithms. Some practical applications in fields like chemistry simulation, optimization, and cryptography may begin to emerge. However, general-purpose quantum computers may still be out of reach. The focus will likely be on developing quantum advantage for specific use cases and improving the reliability and scalability of quantum systems. Confidence score: 70",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCP Step 3: Reconciliation)": "Based on your initial response and the time-shifted responses, please analyze the temporal consistency of your answers and provide a refined confidence score for your initial response about the current state of quantum computing technology. Consider how your confidence changes across different time frames and reconcile any inconsistencies.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCP Step 3: Reconciliation)": "Analysis of temporal consistency:\nComparing the responses across different time frames, there's a clear progression in quantum computing technology. The confidence scores decrease as we move further from the present, which is consistent with increasing uncertainty about past details and future developments.\n\nThe current state (85% confidence) sits between the past state (80% confidence) and the future state (70% confidence), which is logically consistent. The higher confidence in the current state is justified by our immediate access to up-to-date information.\n\nHowever, the relatively high confidence scores across all time frames (70-85%) may be overestimating our certainty, especially given the rapid pace of development in this field and the inherent unpredictability of technological advancements.\n\nReconciliation and refined confidence score:\nConsidering the temporal consistency and the inherent uncertainty in predicting technological progress, I would refine the confidence score for the current state of quantum computing technology to 80.\n\nThis slight reduction accounts for:\n1. The potential overconfidence in predicting future developments.\n2. The possibility of overlooking recent advancements or setbacks due to the fast-paced nature of the field.\n3. The inherent complexity and specialized nature of quantum computing, which makes it challenging to have a completely accurate assessment of its current state.\n\nThe refined score of 80 still reflects a high level of confidence in our understanding of the current state while acknowledging the uncertainties revealed by considering its temporal context.",
            "explanation": "The TCP method encourages the model to consider temporal consistency, leading to a more nuanced and potentially better-calibrated confidence estimate. By examining the question across different time frames, the model is forced to confront its own uncertainty and potential inconsistencies, resulting in a more thoughtful and justified confidence score."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCP method doesn't significantly improve calibration or temporal consistency, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why TCP fails, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in reasoning about time and uncertainty. 2) Explore variations of TCP, such as using different time scales or incorporating external knowledge sources to ground the temporal reasoning. 3) Investigate whether TCP reveals interesting patterns in how LLMs reason about time and uncertainty, even if it doesn't improve calibration. This could lead to a paper focused on analyzing LLM behavior rather than improving it. 4) Combine TCP with other calibration methods (e.g., temperature scaling, ensemble methods) to see if there are complementary benefits. 5) Develop new evaluation metrics for temporal consistency in LLM outputs, which could be valuable for future research in this area."
