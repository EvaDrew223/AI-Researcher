            "Uncertainty-Aware Self-Debate": {
                "Problem": "Large language models often generate confident responses even when they are uncertain or incorrect, leading to potential misinformation and reduced trust.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include direct confidence elicitation, ensemble methods, and calibration techniques.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by human decision-making processes, where we often debate with ourselves when uncertain, we propose a method that encourages LLMs to engage in internal debate to better assess their own uncertainty.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Self-Debate (UASD), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Initial Response: The LLM generates an initial answer. 2) Counterargument Generation: The LLM is prompted to generate potential counterarguments to its initial response. 3) Rebuttal: The LLM attempts to address each counterargument. 4) Confidence Estimation: Based on the strength of counterarguments and rebuttals, the LLM estimates its confidence level. 5) Final Response: The LLM provides a final answer, incorporating insights from the debate process and expressing appropriate uncertainty.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare UASD with direct confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on various question-answering datasets, evaluating calibration error, AUROC, and qualitative analysis of expressed uncertainty."
            },
            "Contrastive Confidence Elicitation": {
                "Problem": "LLMs struggle to provide accurate confidence estimates, often being overconfident in incorrect answers and underconfident in correct ones.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include temperature scaling, direct confidence prompting, and consistency-based methods.",
                "Motivation": "Humans often assess confidence by comparing options and considering alternatives. We propose leveraging this contrastive approach for more accurate confidence estimation in LLMs.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contrastive Confidence Elicitation (CCE): 1) Generate multiple answer candidates for a given question. 2) For each candidate, prompt the LLM to generate supporting and opposing arguments. 3) Use a contrastive prompting technique to compare the strength of arguments across all candidates. 4) Based on the relative strength of arguments, assign confidence scores to each candidate. 5) Select the final answer and express confidence based on the contrastive analysis.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCE against direct confidence elicitation and consistency-based methods on multiple-choice and open-ended question answering tasks, measuring calibration error, Brier score, and AUROC."
            },
            "Dynamic Confidence Threshold Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Fixed confidence thresholds for LLM decision-making fail to account for task-specific and context-dependent uncertainty.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often use static confidence thresholds or manually tuned thresholds for different tasks.",
                "Motivation": "Different tasks and contexts require different levels of certainty. We propose a method that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds based on task characteristics and potential consequences of errors.",
                "Proposed Method": "We present Dynamic Confidence Threshold Prompting (DCTP): 1) Task Analysis: Prompt the LLM to analyze the given task, considering factors like complexity, domain, and potential impact of errors. 2) Threshold Setting: Based on the analysis, prompt the LLM to propose a suitable confidence threshold for the specific task. 3) Answer Generation: Generate an answer to the task. 4) Confidence Estimation: Estimate confidence in the generated answer. 5) Threshold Application: Compare the estimated confidence to the dynamically set threshold, deciding whether to output the answer or express uncertainty.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare DCTP with fixed-threshold approaches across diverse tasks (e.g., factual QA, medical diagnosis, financial advice), evaluating decision quality, abstention rate, and appropriateness of confidence thresholds."
            },
            "Meta-Cognitive Prompting for Uncertainty Quantification": {
                "Problem": "LLMs lack explicit meta-cognitive abilities to accurately assess their own knowledge and uncertainty across different domains and task types.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often treat uncertainty estimation as a separate task from the main inference process.",
                "Motivation": "Human experts can often accurately gauge their level of expertise in different areas and adjust their confidence accordingly. We aim to instill similar meta-cognitive abilities in LLMs through carefully designed prompting strategies.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Meta-Cognitive Prompting (MCP): 1) Domain Assessment: Prompt the LLM to assess its knowledge level in the task's domain. 2) Task Decomposition: Break down the task into subtasks and assess confidence for each. 3) Knowledge Retrieval: Explicitly prompt for relevant knowledge and assess its reliability. 4) Reasoning Transparency: Generate step-by-step reasoning, highlighting uncertain steps. 5) Uncertainty Aggregation: Combine uncertainty estimates from all previous steps to produce a final confidence score.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MCP against standard confidence elicitation techniques on a diverse set of tasks spanning multiple domains, measuring calibration error, domain-specific performance, and correlation between expressed and actual uncertainty."
            },
            "Adversarial Confidence Calibration": {
                "Problem": "LLMs are often overconfident in their wrong answers, especially for tricky or adversarial questions designed to exploit their weaknesses.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on average-case performance and may not adequately address adversarial scenarios.",
                "Motivation": "By exposing LLMs to adversarial examples during the confidence estimation process, we can improve their ability to recognize and express uncertainty in challenging scenarios.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Calibration (ACC): 1) Adversarial Example Generation: Use the LLM to generate potential adversarial questions or variations of the original question. 2) Multi-Perspective Answering: Generate answers to both the original and adversarial questions. 3) Consistency Analysis: Compare answers across variations to identify potential inconsistencies or vulnerabilities. 4) Adversarial Critique: Prompt the LLM to critique its own answers from an adversarial perspective. 5) Robust Confidence Estimation: Based on the consistency analysis and adversarial critique, estimate a robust confidence score that accounts for potential adversarial weaknesses.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ACC against standard calibration techniques on both regular and adversarially-crafted test sets, measuring calibration error, robustness to adversarial examples, and false confidence reduction."
