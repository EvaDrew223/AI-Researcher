                "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to provide consistent and well-calibrated confidence estimates across different prompts for the same task.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on single-shot confidence elicitation or aggregating multiple independent samples.",
                "Motivation": "Humans often refine their confidence estimates through self-reflection and considering multiple perspectives. We can leverage this insight to improve LLM confidence calibration.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence Coherence Prompting, a multi-step prompting strategy that encourages LLMs to generate coherent confidence estimates. The process involves: 1) Initial response and confidence estimate, 2) Generation of alternative perspectives or potential flaws in reasoning, 3) Reflection on these alternatives, 4) Revised confidence estimate with justification, and 5) Meta-analysis of the confidence revision process. Each step is guided by carefully crafted prompts that encourage the model to critically examine its own reasoning and uncertainty.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare Confidence Coherence Prompting against single-shot confidence elicitation and ensemble methods on various question-answering and reasoning tasks. Evaluate using calibration metrics, Brier score, and AUROC for identifying correct vs. incorrect answers."

            "Adversarial Confidence Elicitation": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit overconfidence, particularly in domains where they lack expertise or encounter ambiguous information.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing methods mostly focus on direct confidence elicitation or using model logits, which may not adequately capture epistemic uncertainty.",
                "Motivation": "By simulating a challenging cross-examination process, we can probe the limits of an LLM's knowledge and encourage more conservative confidence estimates.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Elicitation, a multi-agent prompting framework where one LLM instance acts as an 'adversary' to challenge the confidence of another. The process involves: 1) Initial response and confidence estimate from the primary LLM, 2) Generation of probing questions and potential counterarguments by the adversarial LLM, 3) Responses to these challenges by the primary LLM, 4) Iterative refinement of challenges and responses, and 5) Final confidence recalibration based on the entire dialogue. Prompts are designed to encourage the adversary to find edge cases and knowledge boundaries.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on diverse tasks including factual QA, reasoning problems, and domain-specific queries. Compare against standard confidence elicitation techniques and assess the method's robustness to different model pairings and prompt variations."

            "Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often provide a single confidence score, which fails to distinguish between different sources of uncertainty (e.g., epistemic vs. aleatoric).",
                "Existing Methods": "Most existing approaches focus on overall confidence estimation without explicitly addressing the nature of the uncertainty.",
                "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to reason about different types of uncertainty separately, we can obtain more nuanced and informative confidence estimates.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty Decomposition Prompting, a structured prompting technique that guides LLMs to break down their uncertainty into multiple components. The process includes: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Prompted analysis of knowledge-based (epistemic) uncertainty, 3) Assessment of inherent problem ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty), 4) Consideration of potential biases or limitations in the model's training, and 5) Synthesis of these components into a detailed uncertainty profile. Each step uses carefully designed prompts to elicit specific aspects of uncertainty reasoning.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on a range of tasks with varying degrees of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. Compare against baseline confidence estimation techniques and evaluate the method's ability to distinguish between different uncertainty types using specially designed test sets."

            "Temporal Consistency Confidence Calibration": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often provide inconsistent confidence estimates when queried multiple times or when the same information is presented in different contexts.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on single-instance confidence estimation or simple averaging of multiple samples.",
                "Motivation": "By enforcing temporal consistency in confidence estimates across multiple related queries, we can obtain more reliable and stable uncertainty quantification.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Consistency Confidence Calibration, a prompting strategy that leverages the model's memory of past interactions to calibrate its confidence over time. The method involves: 1) Initial query and confidence estimation, 2) Storage of the query-response-confidence triplet in the context, 3) Subsequent related queries with prompts referencing past interactions, 4) Prompted comparison and reconciliation of current and past confidence estimates, and 5) Generation of a calibrated confidence score that maintains consistency with the model's response history. Prompts are designed to encourage the model to explain and justify any changes in confidence over time.",

                "Problem": "LLMs often fail to account for alternative scenarios or missing information when estimating their confidence, leading to overconfidence in incomplete or ambiguous situations.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing confidence estimation techniques typically focus on the given information without explicitly considering what-if scenarios or potential knowledge gaps.",
                "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to reason about counterfactuals and missing information, we can obtain more robust and conservative confidence estimates that better reflect true uncertainty.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Confidence Refinement, a prompting technique that guides LLMs to explore alternative scenarios and knowledge gaps before finalizing their confidence estimates. The process includes: 1) Initial response and confidence estimation, 2) Prompted generation of potential counterfactuals or missing information that could change the answer, 3) Assessment of the likelihood and impact of each counterfactual, 4) Reflection on the model's knowledge boundaries related to the query, and 5) Refinement of the confidence estimate based on the counterfactual analysis. Prompts are carefully crafted to encourage thorough exploration of alternative possibilities and acknowledgment of unknown factors.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on a variety of reasoning and decision-making tasks, particularly those involving incomplete information or multiple plausible outcomes. Compare against standard confidence estimation techniques and evaluate the method's ability to produce well-calibrated confidence scores in the face of ambiguity or partial information."

                "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their reasoning processes, often providing overconfident responses even when their logic is flawed.",
                "Existing Methods": "Standard chain-of-thought prompting and confidence scoring methods typically produce point estimates without capturing the full distribution of possible outcomes.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by probabilistic programming languages, we can leverage LLMs' natural language understanding to express and propagate uncertainty throughout a multi-step reasoning process.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Probabilistic Chain-of-Thought (PCoT) prompting, where each reasoning step is augmented with a distribution over possible outcomes. The prompt instructs the model to express uncertainty at each step using natural language (e.g., \"There's a 70% chance X is true, 20% chance Y is true, and 10% chance I'm missing something\"). The model then propagates these uncertainties through subsequent steps, combining probabilities as needed. The final answer includes a full probability distribution over possible outcomes, providing a nuanced view of the model's confidence.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare PCoT against standard CoT and other uncertainty quantification methods on diverse reasoning tasks, evaluating both the accuracy of final predictions and the calibration of reported uncertainty distributions."

                "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize the limitations of their own knowledge or reasoning, leading to overconfidence in incorrect answers.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches like self-consistency checks or calibrated softmax outputs don't fully capture the nuanced ways humans assess their own knowledge and uncertainty.",
                "Motivation": "By simulating an internal debate between multiple perspectives within the model, we can encourage more thorough exploration of potential flaws or gaps in reasoning.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Debate Prompting (MDP), where the model is instructed to generate multiple distinct 'personas' with different levels of expertise and skepticism. These personas engage in a structured debate about the given problem, critiquing each other's arguments and explicitly discussing levels of certainty. The prompt guides the model to synthesize the debate into a final answer, including a nuanced assessment of confidence based on the strength and consensus of arguments presented. This method encourages the model to 'argue with itself' and consider potential weaknesses in its own reasoning.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MDP against standard prompting and other uncertainty quantification methods on a range of tasks, particularly those requiring critical thinking or domain expertise. Assess both the quality of final answers and the correlation between expressed uncertainty and actual error rates."

                "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their knowledge gaps when answering questions that require external information.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches either rely on pre-retrieval or post-hoc uncertainty estimation, without dynamically adapting the retrieval process based on the model's evolving understanding of its uncertainty.",
                "Motivation": "By integrating uncertainty estimation directly into the information retrieval process, we can create a more adaptive and robust system for knowledge-intensive tasks.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Information Retrieval (UAIR) prompting. The model is first prompted to decompose a given question into sub-questions, estimating its uncertainty for each. Based on these estimates, it formulates targeted search queries, retrieving information for high-uncertainty components. The model then integrates this new information, updating its uncertainty estimates and potentially generating new sub-questions or queries. This iterative process continues until the model reaches a confidence threshold or exhausts a query budget. The final answer includes both the response and a detailed breakdown of remaining uncertainties.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare UAIR against standard retrieval-augmented generation and other uncertainty estimation methods on knowledge-intensive QA tasks. Evaluate not only answer accuracy but also the efficiency and relevance of information retrieval, as well as the calibration of reported uncertainties throughout the process."

                "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit poor calibration, especially when dealing with out-of-distribution or ambiguous inputs where multiple valid interpretations exist.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on adjusting confidence scores post-hoc or fine-tuning models on calibration data, without fully leveraging the model's ability to reason about relative confidences.",
                "Motivation": "By prompting the model to explicitly compare and contrast its confidence across multiple potential interpretations or answers, we can obtain more nuanced and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Confidence Calibration (CCC) prompting. For a given input, the model is instructed to generate multiple plausible interpretations or answers. It then engages in a pairwise comparison process, articulating reasons why it might be more or less confident in one option over another. These comparisons are used to construct a relative confidence ranking. The model is then prompted to assign quantitative confidence scores that respect this ranking while also considering absolute confidence levels. Finally, the model is asked to critique its own calibration process, potentially adjusting scores based on this meta-analysis.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCC against standard confidence estimation methods on a diverse set of tasks, including those with inherent ambiguity or multiple valid answers. Assess both the calibration of confidence scores and the quality of the reasoning provided for relative confidences."

            "Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often fail to accurately capture uncertainty in tasks requiring temporal reasoning or prediction, especially when extrapolating beyond their training data.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on in-distribution uncertainty estimation or simple time-series forecasting, without fully leveraging LLMs' ability to reason about complex temporal dynamics and potential future scenarios.",
                "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about how uncertainty grows over time and consider multiple potential future trajectories, we can obtain more realistic and nuanced uncertainty estimates for temporal prediction tasks.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Extrapolation Uncertainty (TEU) prompting. Given a temporal prediction task, the model is first prompted to identify key factors that influence the prediction and how their uncertainty might evolve over time. It then generates multiple plausible future scenarios, explicitly reasoning about branching points and how different assumptions lead to diverging outcomes. For each scenario, the model assigns time-dependent confidence intervals, considering both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) and epistemic uncertainty (model knowledge limitations). Finally, the model synthesizes these scenarios into a unified prediction with temporal uncertainty bands, explaining how and why uncertainty changes over the prediction horizon.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare TEU against standard time-series forecasting methods and other LLM-based prediction approaches on a range of temporal prediction tasks, from short-term forecasting to long-range extrapolation. Evaluate not only prediction accuracy but also the calibration of uncertainty estimates at different time horizons and the quality of generated future scenarios."
