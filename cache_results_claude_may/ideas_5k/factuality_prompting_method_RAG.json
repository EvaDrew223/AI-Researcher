            "Counterfactual Reasoning Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with factual consistency and logical reasoning, especially when faced with complex scenarios that require considering alternative possibilities.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like Chain-of-Thought prompting focus on linear reasoning but may not fully capture the nuances of counterfactual thinking.",
                "Motivation": "Humans often improve their reasoning by considering 'what-if' scenarios. By prompting LLMs to engage in counterfactual thinking, we can potentially enhance their ability to reason about facts and reduce hallucinations.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Reasoning Prompting (CRP), a multi-step prompting technique that guides LLMs through a process of considering alternative scenarios. The prompt structure includes: 1) Initial response generation, 2) Counterfactual scenario generation (e.g., 'What if X were different?'), 3) Analysis of counterfactual implications, 4) Comparison between initial and counterfactual scenarios, and 5) Synthesis of a final, more robust response. This method encourages LLMs to explore multiple possibilities, challenge their initial assumptions, and arrive at more factually grounded conclusions.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CRP against standard prompting and Chain-of-Thought prompting on factual reasoning tasks from datasets like TruthfulQA and FactualityPrompt. Measure improvements in factual accuracy, logical consistency, and reduction in hallucinations."
            },
            "Hierarchical Decomposition Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often struggle with complex, multi-faceted questions that require breaking down information into manageable components before answering.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing methods like few-shot prompting or Chain-of-Thought prompting don't explicitly guide LLMs to decompose complex problems hierarchically.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by divide-and-conquer algorithms and human problem-solving strategies, we propose a method to guide LLMs in systematically breaking down complex questions into simpler sub-questions.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Hierarchical Decomposition Prompting (HDP), a structured prompting technique that guides LLMs to: 1) Analyze the main question and identify key components, 2) Generate a hierarchy of sub-questions, from broad to specific, 3) Answer each sub-question in a bottom-up manner, 4) Synthesize sub-answers to address broader questions, and 5) Formulate a final answer to the main question. This hierarchical approach allows LLMs to focus on smaller, more manageable pieces of information, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations and improving overall factual accuracy.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare HDP with standard prompting and Chain-of-Thought prompting on complex question-answering tasks from datasets like HotpotQA and ComplexWebQuestions. Evaluate based on accuracy, factual consistency, and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps."
            },
            "Adversarial Self-Critique Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information, especially when dealing with ambiguous or challenging queries.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like self-consistency checks or external fact-checking don't fully leverage the model's ability to critically analyze its own outputs.",
                "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to act as their own adversarial critic, we can potentially uncover and address factual inconsistencies and logical flaws in their initial responses.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Critique Prompting (ASCP), a multi-agent simulation within a single LLM. The process involves: 1) Generate an initial response, 2) Assume the role of a highly skeptical expert and critique the response, identifying potential factual errors or logical inconsistencies, 3) Switch back to the original responder role and address the critiques, 4) Iterate between critic and responder roles until a consensus is reached or a maximum number of iterations is hit, 5) Synthesize a final, refined response incorporating insights from the adversarial process. This method encourages LLMs to rigorously question their own outputs and correct potential hallucinations.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ASCP against standard prompting and self-consistency methods on factual QA tasks from datasets like TruthfulQA and FaithDial. Measure improvements in factual accuracy, reduction in hallucinations, and the quality of self-corrections made during the adversarial process."
            },
            "Temporal Consistency Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often struggle with maintaining factual consistency across different time periods, leading to anachronistic errors and temporal hallucinations.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current prompting methods typically don't explicitly address temporal reasoning and consistency in a structured manner.",
                "Motivation": "By guiding LLMs to reason about temporal relationships and changes over time, we can potentially improve their factual accuracy and reduce temporally inconsistent hallucinations.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Temporal Consistency Prompting (TCP), a structured prompting technique that guides LLMs through a temporal reasoning process: 1) Identify key temporal elements in the query, 2) Establish a timeline of relevant events and facts, 3) Reason about changes and consistencies across different time points, 4) Generate a response that explicitly addresses temporal relationships, 5) Perform a temporal consistency check to ensure the response doesn't contradict established timeline facts. This method encourages LLMs to anchor their responses in specific time periods and reason about temporal changes, reducing the likelihood of anachronistic errors.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare TCP with standard prompting and Chain-of-Thought prompting on temporal reasoning tasks, using datasets like TimeQA and TempQuestions. Evaluate based on temporal accuracy, consistency across time periods, and reduction in anachronistic hallucinations."
            },
            "Multimodal Anchor Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs can struggle with grounding their responses in factual information, especially when dealing with visual or spatial concepts that are challenging to represent purely in text.",
                "Existing Methods": "Most existing prompting methods for improving factuality focus solely on text-based interactions, missing out on the potential of multimodal anchoring.",
                "Motivation": "By leveraging multimodal information as 'anchors' for reasoning, we can potentially improve LLMs' factual grounding and reduce hallucinations, especially for queries involving visual or spatial elements.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Multimodal Anchor Prompting (MAP), a technique that integrates visual and textual information to ground LLM responses. The process involves: 1) Analyze the query to identify key visual or spatial elements, 2) Retrieve or generate relevant images or diagrams, 3) Describe the visual elements in detail, creating a 'visual anchor', 4) Prompt the LLM to reason about the query while explicitly referencing the visual anchor, 5) Generate a response that integrates insights from both textual and visual information. This method encourages LLMs to ground their reasoning in concrete visual representations, potentially reducing abstract hallucinations.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MAP against text-only prompting methods on tasks involving visual and spatial reasoning, using multimodal datasets like VQA-v2 and GQA. Measure improvements in factual accuracy, spatial reasoning, and reduction in hallucinations related to visual concepts."
