            "Hierarchical Decomposition Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with complex mathematical problems that require multiple steps and hierarchical reasoning.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches like chain-of-thought prompting provide a linear sequence of reasoning steps, which may not capture the hierarchical nature of complex math problems.",
                "Motivation": "Mathematical problem-solving often involves breaking down complex problems into simpler sub-problems, which can be solved independently and then combined to reach the final solution.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Hierarchical Decomposition Prompting (HDP), a novel prompting technique that guides the model to break down complex math problems into a tree-like structure of sub-problems. The prompt instructs the model to: 1) Identify the main problem, 2) Break it down into sub-problems, 3) Recursively decompose sub-problems until reaching atomic operations, 4) Solve atomic problems bottom-up, and 5) Combine solutions to solve the original problem. Each node in the tree represents a sub-problem, with leaf nodes being basic operations the model can solve directly. This approach allows for parallel processing of independent sub-problems and better handling of problem dependencies.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare HDP with standard prompting, chain-of-thought, and other baseline methods on complex mathematical reasoning datasets such as MATH and GSM8K. Evaluate based on accuracy, problem-solving efficiency, and the ability to handle increasingly complex problems."

            "Meta-Cognitive Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Large language models often make errors in mathematical reasoning due to a lack of self-awareness about their own problem-solving process and potential pitfalls.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on generating step-by-step solutions without explicitly considering the model's own cognitive processes and potential error sources.",
                "Motivation": "Human experts in mathematics often employ meta-cognitive strategies, such as planning their approach, monitoring their progress, and evaluating their solutions. Incorporating these meta-cognitive elements into prompting could improve the model's problem-solving abilities.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Meta-Cognitive Prompting (MCP), a technique that guides the model through a structured problem-solving process with explicit meta-cognitive steps. The prompt includes: 1) Problem Analysis: Identify key information and potential challenges. 2) Strategy Selection: Choose appropriate problem-solving methods. 3) Solution Planning: Outline the steps to solve the problem. 4) Progress Monitoring: Regularly check progress and identify potential errors. 5) Solution Evaluation: Assess the reasonableness of the final answer. 6) Reflection: Analyze the problem-solving process and identify areas for improvement. This approach encourages the model to be more deliberate and self-aware in its mathematical reasoning.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MCP against standard prompting and chain-of-thought methods on diverse mathematical reasoning tasks, including arithmetic, algebra, and geometry problems. Assess not only the final accuracy but also the quality of the reasoning process and the model's ability to catch and correct its own errors."

            "Adversarial Self-Challenging Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Large language models often fall into local optima or make systematic errors when solving mathematical problems, especially when faced with tricky or deceptive problem formulations.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current prompting methods typically focus on guiding the model through a single problem-solving attempt, which may not be robust against adversarial or challenging problem formulations.",
                "Motivation": "Expert problem solvers often challenge their own initial solutions by considering alternative approaches or potential pitfalls. Incorporating this self-challenging aspect into prompting could lead to more robust and accurate mathematical reasoning.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Challenging Prompting (ASCP), a multi-stage prompting technique that encourages the model to actively challenge and improve its own solutions. The process involves: 1) Initial Solution: Generate a first attempt at solving the problem. 2) Adversarial Reformulation: Rephrase the original problem in a potentially tricky or misleading way. 3) Alternative Solution: Solve the reformulated problem. 4) Discrepancy Analysis: Compare the two solutions and identify any differences. 5) Resolution: Reconcile any discrepancies and determine the correct solution. 6) Confidence Assessment: Evaluate the certainty of the final answer. This approach helps the model to consider multiple perspectives and be more robust against potential misunderstandings or oversight.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Test ASCP against standard prompting and chain-of-thought methods on mathematical reasoning datasets, with a focus on problems known to be challenging or deceptive. Evaluate based on accuracy, robustness to problem reformulation, and the model's ability to catch and correct its own errors."

                "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with problems that require a combination of symbolic manipulation and numerical computation, leading to errors in complex mathematical reasoning tasks.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current prompting methods typically treat mathematical reasoning as a purely textual task, without explicitly separating symbolic and numerical aspects of problem-solving.",
                "Motivation": "Mathematical problem-solving often involves a interplay between symbolic reasoning (e.g., algebraic manipulation) and numerical computation. Explicitly separating these aspects in the prompting process could lead to more accurate and interpretable solutions.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Symbolic-Numerical Hybrid Prompting (SNHP), a technique that guides the model to alternate between symbolic and numerical reasoning modes. The prompt structure includes: 1) Symbolic Formulation: Express the problem using mathematical symbols and equations. 2) Symbolic Manipulation: Perform algebraic transformations to simplify the problem. 3) Numerical Substitution: Replace symbols with specific numerical values when necessary. 4) Numerical Computation: Perform precise calculations on numerical values. 5) Symbolic Generalization: Interpret numerical results in terms of the original symbolic formulation. This approach allows the model to leverage its strengths in both language understanding (for symbolic manipulation) and pattern recognition (for numerical computation).",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SNHP against standard prompting and chain-of-thought methods on a range of mathematical problems that require both symbolic and numerical reasoning, such as algebra word problems and calculus. Assess not only the final accuracy but also the correctness of intermediate symbolic manipulations and numerical computations."

                "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with applying abstract mathematical concepts to solve concrete problems, leading to difficulties in tackling advanced or novel mathematical challenges.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing prompting methods typically focus on guiding the model through specific problem-solving steps without explicitly building up the necessary conceptual understanding.",
                "Motivation": "Effective mathematical problem-solving often requires a strong grasp of underlying concepts and principles. By explicitly scaffolding the conceptual understanding before tackling the problem, we might improve the model's ability to apply abstract knowledge to concrete situations.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Conceptual Scaffolding Prompting (CSP), a multi-stage prompting technique that builds up the model's conceptual understanding before addressing the specific problem. The process involves: 1) Concept Identification: Recognize the key mathematical concepts relevant to the problem. 2) Concept Explanation: Provide a brief explanation of each identified concept. 3) Example Generation: Create simple examples that illustrate the application of these concepts. 4) Concept Mapping: Explicitly map the abstract concepts to elements of the given problem. 5) Guided Application: Solve the problem while referring back to the conceptual framework established in the previous steps. 6) Solution Justification: Explain how the solution relates to the underlying concepts. This approach aims to enhance the model's ability to apply abstract mathematical knowledge to diverse problem contexts.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Test CSP against standard prompting and chain-of-thought methods on advanced mathematical reasoning datasets, particularly those involving abstract concepts or novel problem formulations. Evaluate based on accuracy, the quality of conceptual understanding demonstrated, and the ability to transfer knowledge to solve related problems."
