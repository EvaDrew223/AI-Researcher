            "Confidence Calibration via Iterative Self-Debate": {
                "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, leading to unreliable outputs in critical applications.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include temperature scaling, ensemble methods, and direct confidence elicitation through prompting.",
                "Motivation": "Humans often refine their confidence by engaging in internal debates, considering multiple perspectives before settling on a final judgment.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Iterative Self-Debate for Confidence Calibration (ISDCC). The model is prompted to generate multiple conflicting viewpoints on a given question, each with an initial confidence score. These viewpoints then engage in a structured debate, where the model critiques each perspective, updates confidence scores, and synthesizes new arguments. This process continues for several rounds until a consensus is reached or confidence scores stabilize. The final confidence is derived from the debate outcome, incorporating the strength and consistency of arguments presented.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare ISDCC against standard confidence elicitation methods on benchmark datasets like TruthfulQA and MMLU, evaluating calibration error, Brier score, and AUROC for identifying correct vs. incorrect answers."
            },
            "Metacognitive Prompting for Uncertainty Quantification": {
                "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to accurately assess their own knowledge limitations, often failing to express uncertainty when appropriate.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches include direct prompting for confidence scores and using model logits or softmax outputs.",
                "Motivation": "Human metacognition involves reflection on one's own thought processes and knowledge state, which can be simulated in LLMs through carefully designed prompts.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Prompting (MP), a multi-stage prompting technique. First, we prompt the model to generate a detailed explanation of its reasoning process. Then, we ask it to critically analyze this explanation, identifying potential weaknesses or gaps in knowledge. Next, we prompt the model to rate its confidence based on this analysis, considering factors like the complexity of the question, the completeness of its explanation, and any identified knowledge gaps. Finally, we ask the model to provide a calibrated uncertainty estimate, taking into account its historical performance on similar tasks.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MP against baseline methods on diverse question-answering datasets, measuring calibration error, confidence-error correlation, and performance in identifying 'unknown' cases where the model should express high uncertainty."
            },
            "Confidence-Aware Chain-of-Thought Reasoning": {
                "Problem": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has improved LLM reasoning, but doesn't inherently provide well-calibrated confidence estimates for complex multi-step problems.",
                "Existing Methods": "Standard CoT prompting focuses on generating intermediate reasoning steps without explicitly quantifying uncertainty at each step.",
                "Motivation": "In multi-step reasoning, errors can compound, and uncertainty should be propagated through the chain of thought.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Aware Chain-of-Thought (CA-CoT) prompting. For each reasoning step, the model is prompted to provide: (1) the intermediate conclusion, (2) a confidence score for that specific step, and (3) a brief justification for the confidence score. As reasoning progresses, the model is instructed to consider how uncertainties in previous steps affect the current step. At the end of the chain, the model synthesizes these step-wise confidences into an overall confidence score, explaining how uncertainties accumulated or resolved throughout the reasoning process. This method allows for fine-grained uncertainty quantification that accounts for the complexity of multi-step reasoning.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare CA-CoT against standard CoT and other confidence estimation methods on multi-step reasoning tasks from datasets like GSM8K and MATH, evaluating both task performance and the quality of uncertainty estimates at intermediate and final steps."
            },
            "Adversarial Self-Evaluation for Robust Confidence Estimation": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often fail to recognize their own limitations, particularly in edge cases or adversarial scenarios, leading to overconfident incorrect predictions.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically focus on direct confidence elicitation or statistical calibration techniques, which may not capture model vulnerabilities effectively.",
                "Motivation": "By actively searching for potential flaws in its own reasoning, a model can develop a more nuanced and robust understanding of its confidence levels.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Self-Evaluation (ASE) for confidence estimation. Given a question and an initial answer, the model is prompted to generate a series of adversarial scenarios or edge cases that could potentially invalidate its answer. For each scenario, the model evaluates whether its original answer holds true. If inconsistencies are found, the model updates its answer and confidence. This process continues iteratively, with the model generating increasingly challenging adversarial cases. The final confidence score is based on the proportion of scenarios where the answer remained consistent, weighted by the perceived difficulty of each scenario.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ASE against standard confidence estimation techniques on a range of tasks, including those with known edge cases or adversarial examples. Measure not only calibration metrics but also the method's ability to identify potential failure modes and adjust confidence accordingly."

            "Dynamic Context Expansion for Uncertainty-Aware Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to accurately assess their confidence when faced with questions that require broad or specialized knowledge not immediately accessible in the given context.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on fixed contexts or simple retrieval methods, which may not adequately capture the full scope of information needed for confident answers.",
                "Motivation": "Human experts often seek additional information when unsure, expanding their knowledge base before making confident assertions.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Dynamic Context Expansion (DCE) for uncertainty-aware prompting. When faced with a question, the model first assesses its initial confidence. If below a threshold, it generates a series of follow-up questions or topics it needs to 'research' to increase confidence. These questions guide a context expansion process, where relevant information is retrieved or generated. The model then re-evaluates the original question with this expanded context, updating its answer and confidence. This process iterates, with the model dynamically expanding its context until it reaches a satisfactory confidence level or determines that the question cannot be answered confidently with available information. The final output includes the answer, confidence score, and a summary of the context expansion process.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare DCE against fixed-context baselines on a diverse set of open-domain questions, evaluating not only answer accuracy and confidence calibration but also the quality and relevance of the dynamically expanded context. Analyze how the method performs across questions of varying difficulty and domain specificity."

            "Uncertainty-Aware Contrastive Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty, leading to overconfident responses in ambiguous or low-knowledge situations.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on direct confidence elicitation or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty.",
                "Motivation": "By prompting the model to consider contrasting viewpoints and explicitly reason about uncertainty, we can potentially improve its ability to recognize and communicate ambiguity.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Contrastive Prompting (UACP), a novel prompting technique that encourages models to explore multiple perspectives and quantify uncertainty. The prompt structure includes: 1) An initial query, 2) Instructions to generate contrasting viewpoints, 3) A request to evaluate the strength of evidence for each viewpoint, 4) Guidance to synthesize a final response with an explicit uncertainty rating. For example: 'Question: X? Generate two contrasting answers. Evaluate the evidence for each. Synthesize a final response with an uncertainty rating (0-100%).'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare UACP against standard prompting and existing uncertainty quantification methods on diverse question-answering datasets. Evaluate using calibration metrics, accuracy of uncertainty estimates, and human judgments of response quality."

            "Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition": {
                "Problem": "Current uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often provide a single, holistic uncertainty estimate, failing to capture the nuanced sources of uncertainty in complex reasoning tasks.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall confidence scores or uncertainty intervals for model outputs.",
                "Motivation": "By recursively breaking down complex queries into simpler components and assessing uncertainty at each level, we can potentially achieve more fine-grained and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Recursive Uncertainty Decomposition (RUD), a prompting technique that guides the model to: 1) Decompose the main query into sub-questions, 2) Assess uncertainty for each sub-question, 3) Recursively apply this process to complex sub-questions, 4) Aggregate uncertainties using a bottom-up approach. The final prompt includes instructions like: 'Decompose the question into sub-questions. For each sub-question, provide an answer and uncertainty level (0-100%). For complex sub-questions, repeat the decomposition process. Finally, synthesize the overall answer and aggregate uncertainty.'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate RUD against baseline uncertainty quantification methods on multi-step reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving and complex inference chains. Measure performance using calibration metrics, accuracy of uncertainty estimates at various decomposition levels, and human-judged interpretability of uncertainty breakdowns."

            "Counterfactual Confidence Calibration": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit poor calibration, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios, leading to unreliable confidence estimates.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on post-hoc adjustments or fine-tuning approaches.",
                "Motivation": "By prompting the model to consider counterfactual scenarios and how they would affect its confidence, we can potentially improve its ability to calibrate confidence across diverse contexts.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Confidence Calibration (CCC), a prompting technique that guides the model to: 1) Generate an initial response and confidence estimate, 2) Propose counterfactual scenarios that would increase or decrease confidence, 3) Adjust the confidence estimate based on the absence of these scenarios in the actual context. The prompt structure includes: 'Provide an answer and initial confidence (0-100%). List factors that would increase your confidence if true. List factors that would decrease your confidence if true. Re-evaluate your confidence considering the absence of these factors.'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare CCC against standard confidence elicitation and calibration methods on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Evaluate using standard calibration metrics, accuracy of adjusted confidence estimates, and robustness to distribution shift."

            "Meta-Prompted Uncertainty Sampling": {
                "Problem": "Existing sampling-based uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs often rely on simplistic sampling strategies that may not capture the full range of model uncertainty.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically use techniques like Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods for uncertainty sampling.",
                "Motivation": "By leveraging the LLM's own reasoning capabilities to guide the sampling process, we can potentially obtain more diverse and informative samples for uncertainty quantification.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Meta-Prompted Uncertainty Sampling (MPUS), a technique that uses the LLM to generate its own sampling strategy. The process involves: 1) Prompting the model to analyze the query and propose diverse ways to approach it, 2) Using these approaches as seeds for generating multiple responses, 3) Prompting the model to analyze the diversity and consistency of the samples, 4) Synthesizing an final answer and uncertainty estimate based on the sample analysis. The meta-prompt structure includes: 'Analyze the question and propose 5 diverse approaches to answer it. Generate responses using each approach. Evaluate the consistency and diversity of the responses. Synthesize a final answer and uncertainty estimate (0-100%) based on this analysis.'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare MPUS against standard sampling-based uncertainty quantification methods on a range of tasks, including open-ended generation and structured prediction. Evaluate using metrics for sample diversity, calibration of uncertainty estimates, and correlation between sample consistency and true task difficulty."

                "Motivation": "By dynamically guiding the prompting process based on the model's responses, we can more effectively explore the boundaries of the model's knowledge and confidence.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Gradient-Guided Uncertainty Probing (GGUP), a dynamic prompting technique that iteratively refines questions to probe the model's uncertainty. The process involves: 1) Starting with a broad question and confidence estimate, 2) Generating follow-up questions that target areas of uncertainty, 3) Updating the confidence estimate based on responses to these questions, 4) Iteratively refining the questions to maximize information gain about uncertainty. The prompt structure evolves over iterations: 'Initial question: X? Provide an answer and confidence (0-100%). Generate 3 follow-up questions that would help clarify your uncertainty. Answer these questions and update your confidence. Repeat this process, focusing on areas of remaining uncertainty.'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate GGUP against static prompting and other dynamic uncertainty quantification methods on knowledge-intensive tasks. Measure performance using calibration metrics, efficiency of uncertainty resolution over iterations, and the quality of generated follow-up questions as judged by human experts."
