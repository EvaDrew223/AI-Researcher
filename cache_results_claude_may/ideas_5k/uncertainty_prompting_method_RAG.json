            "Uncertainty-Aware Self-Debate": {
                "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately assess their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident responses on tasks where they lack sufficient knowledge or reasoning ability.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include direct prompting for confidence scores, ensemble methods, and calibration techniques applied post-hoc.",
                "Motivation": "Humans often engage in internal debates when uncertain, considering multiple viewpoints before reaching a conclusion. Simulating this process within an LLM could lead to more nuanced uncertainty estimates.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Self-Debate (UASD), a multi-step prompting technique where the LLM is instructed to: 1) Generate an initial answer and confidence score. 2) Assume the role of a skeptic and critique the initial answer, highlighting potential flaws or alternatives. 3) Respond to the critique from the perspective of the original answerer. 4) Act as an impartial judge to evaluate the debate, providing an updated answer and refined confidence score. This process can be iterated multiple times, with the final confidence score aggregated across iterations.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare UASD against standard confidence elicitation methods on diverse question-answering datasets, evaluating calibration error, AUROC for identifying correct vs. incorrect answers, and correlation between confidence scores and answer correctness."
            },
            "Confidence-Guided Retrieval Augmentation": {
                "Problem": "Retrieval-augmented generation often fails to appropriately leverage external knowledge when the model is uncertain about its relevance or reliability.",
                "Existing Methods": "Traditional retrieval-augmented methods typically use fixed retrieval strategies and do not dynamically adjust based on the model's confidence.",
                "Motivation": "By allowing the model to express uncertainty about retrieved information and guide further retrieval, we can create a more robust and adaptive knowledge integration process.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Confidence-Guided Retrieval Augmentation (CGRA), a novel prompting framework that: 1) Performs initial retrieval based on the query. 2) Prompts the model to assess its confidence in each retrieved passage and explain why it might or might not be relevant. 3) Based on these confidence assessments, dynamically decides whether to: a) Use high-confidence passages directly, b) Perform additional targeted retrieval for low-confidence areas, or c) Abstain from using external information if overall confidence is low. 4) Iteratively refines the retrieval and confidence assessment process until a satisfactory level of confidence is reached or a maximum number of iterations is hit.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CGRA against standard retrieval-augmented generation on open-domain QA tasks, measuring answer correctness, calibration of final confidence scores, and the model's ability to abstain on questions where reliable information cannot be retrieved."
            },
            "Metacognitive Prompting for Uncertainty Estimation": {
                "Problem": "Current methods for eliciting uncertainty from LLMs often rely on simplistic confidence scores, failing to capture the nuanced reasoning behind model uncertainty.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically involve direct prompting for confidence scores or using model logits/probabilities when available.",
                "Motivation": "Human metacognition involves complex processes of self-reflection and uncertainty assessment. By prompting LLMs to engage in explicit metacognitive reasoning, we may obtain more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Prompting for Uncertainty Estimation (MPUE), a multi-stage prompting technique that guides the LLM through a series of metacognitive steps: 1) Initial response generation. 2) Explicit consideration of knowledge gaps: 'What information am I missing to be more certain?' 3) Alternative hypothesis generation: 'What are other possible answers, and why might they be correct?' 4) Difficulty assessment: 'What makes this question challenging for an AI?' 5) Estimate of human performance: 'How would an average human perform on this task?' 6) Synthesis of metacognitive insights into a final uncertainty estimate, including both a numerical score and qualitative explanation.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Compare MPUE against baseline uncertainty estimation methods on diverse tasks, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples. Evaluate not only calibration metrics but also the quality and interpretability of the uncertainty explanations through expert human evaluation."
            },
            "Adversarial Confidence Calibration": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often exhibit poor calibration, particularly in adversarial or out-of-distribution scenarios where they may be overconfident in incorrect answers.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current calibration methods typically focus on in-distribution examples and may not generalize well to adversarial inputs.",
                "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting the model to consider potential adversarial scenarios and edge cases, we can improve calibration in challenging situations.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Confidence Calibration (ACC), a prompting strategy that incorporates adversarial thinking into the confidence estimation process: 1) Generate an initial answer and confidence score. 2) Prompt the model to imagine it is an adversary trying to trick itself: 'If you wanted to create a similar question that would lead to an incorrect answer, how would you modify this question?' 3) Generate several adversarial variations of the original question. 4) Attempt to answer these adversarial questions and compare the results to the original answer. 5) Based on the model's performance on these adversarial examples, adjust the confidence score for the original question. 6) Provide a final confidence score along with an explanation of how considering adversarial cases influenced the uncertainty estimate.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ACC against standard calibration methods on both regular and adversarially-modified test sets. Measure improvements in calibration error, particularly in the high-confidence regime, and assess the model's ability to identify potential vulnerabilities in its own reasoning."
            },
            "Semantic Decomposition for Granular Uncertainty Estimation": {
                "Problem": "Current uncertainty estimation methods often provide a single confidence score for an entire response, failing to capture varying levels of certainty for different aspects of complex answers.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically focus on overall confidence scores or token-level uncertainties, which may not align with semantic units of information.",
                "Motivation": "By decomposing responses into semantic units and estimating uncertainty for each component, we can provide more fine-grained and actionable uncertainty information.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Semantic Decomposition for Granular Uncertainty Estimation (SDGUE), a prompting technique that: 1) Generates an initial response to a query. 2) Prompts the model to break down the response into distinct semantic units or claims. 3) For each semantic unit, instructs the model to: a) Estimate a confidence score. b) Identify the key evidence or reasoning supporting this unit. c) Highlight potential weaknesses or alternative viewpoints. 4) Synthesize the granular uncertainty estimates into an overall confidence structure, representing both the global uncertainty and the relationships between confidence in different components of the answer. 5) Generate a natural language summary explaining the varying levels of certainty across the response.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SDGUE on complex question-answering and summarization tasks, comparing against baselines that provide only overall confidence scores. Assess the accuracy of granular confidence estimates, the usefulness of the semantic decomposition, and the interpretability of the uncertainty explanations through both automatic metrics and human expert evaluation."
