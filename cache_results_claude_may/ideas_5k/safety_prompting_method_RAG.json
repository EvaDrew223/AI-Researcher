            "Adversarial Prompt Immunization": {
                "Problem": "Large language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can bypass their safety guardrails and elicit harmful or biased responses.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on detecting adversarial prompts or fine-tuning models on adversarial examples.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of vaccines in biology, we propose to 'immunize' language models against adversarial prompts by exposing them to weakened versions of potential attacks during inference.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-stage prompting strategy: 1) Adversarial Exposure: Before processing the user's input, we prompt the model to generate potential adversarial variations of the input. 2) Immunization: We then prompt the model to analyze these variations and generate 'antibodies' - specific instructions on how to respond safely to such prompts. Finally, we process the original input, prepending it with the generated 'antibodies' as a safeguard. This method allows the model to proactively defend against potential attacks without requiring fine-tuning or external detectors.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method against state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on popular benchmarks like AdvBench. Compare with baseline models and other defense methods in terms of attack success rate and utility preservation."
            },
            "Semantic Firewall Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Existing LLMs struggle to maintain consistent ethical boundaries across diverse contexts, making them vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks that exploit semantic nuances.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on hard-coded rules or fine-tuning on specific types of adversarial examples.",
                "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from computer network firewalls, we propose a dynamic, content-aware prompting strategy that acts as a semantic firewall, adapting its defense mechanisms based on the context and potential threats.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-layer prompting architecture: 1) Context Analysis: Prompt the model to analyze the input for potential threats, categorizing them into predefined risk levels. 2) Policy Generation: Based on the risk assessment, prompt the model to generate a context-specific 'security policy' - a set of guidelines for safe response generation. 3) Secure Execution: Process the original input using the generated security policy as a guide, ensuring responses adhere to ethical boundaries while maintaining relevance and coherence. This method allows for flexible, context-aware defense without compromising the model's ability to engage in diverse conversations.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Test the method on a range of adversarial datasets, including those with subtle semantic manipulations. Compare performance against baseline models and existing defense methods in terms of safety, coherence, and task-specific metrics."
            },
            "Recursive Self-Auditing Prompts": {
                "Problem": "LLMs can be manipulated into producing harmful content through complex, multi-step adversarial prompts that gradually erode the model's safeguards.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current defenses often focus on single-step attacks or rely on external monitoring systems.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by recursive algorithms and self-reflection techniques in human cognition, we propose a method that enables the model to continually audit its own outputs for potential safety violations.",
                "Proposed Method": "We design a recursive prompting strategy with the following steps: 1) Initial Response: Generate a response to the user's input. 2) Self-Audit: Prompt the model to critically analyze its own response for potential safety issues or hidden adversarial intentions. 3) Correction: If issues are identified, prompt the model to generate a corrected version of the response. 4) Recursion: Repeat steps 2-3 until no further issues are detected or a maximum recursion depth is reached. This approach allows the model to catch and correct increasingly subtle adversarial manipulations that might not be apparent in a single pass.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method against multi-step adversarial attacks on various tasks. Compare with baseline models and existing defenses in terms of attack prevention rate, output quality, and computational efficiency. Analyze the trade-offs between recursion depth and performance."
            },
            "Adversarial Prompt Diffusion": {
                "Problem": "Current LLMs are vulnerable to precisely crafted adversarial prompts, which exploit specific weaknesses in the model's understanding or decision boundaries.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches often focus on detecting or neutralizing specific types of adversarial prompts.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by diffusion models in image generation and the concept of adding noise to increase robustness, we propose a method to 'diffuse' potential adversarial prompts, making them less effective.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce a prompt preprocessing technique: 1) Semantic Noise Generation: Prompt the model to generate multiple semantically similar but syntactically diverse versions of the input prompt. 2) Prompt Ensemble: Create an ensemble of these 'noisy' prompts along with the original. 3) Aggregate Response: Process each prompt in the ensemble and aggregate the responses using a voting or averaging mechanism. This approach aims to dilute the effect of potential adversarial components by introducing semantic 'noise', making it harder for attackers to exploit specific vulnerabilities.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Test the method against various types of adversarial prompts, including jailbreaks and bias-inducing inputs. Compare with baseline models and other defense methods in terms of attack success rate, output consistency, and task performance across different domains."
            },
            "Contrastive Ethical Reasoning Prompts": {
                "Problem": "LLMs can be misled into producing unethical or biased content when presented with adversarial prompts that subtly frame unethical actions as acceptable.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on rule-based filtering or fine-tuning on ethical guidelines.",
                "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning and ethical philosophy, we propose a method that prompts the model to explicitly reason about ethical implications by considering contrasting viewpoints.",
                "Proposed Method": "We design a multi-step prompting strategy: 1) Ethical Framing: Prompt the model to reframe the input in terms of ethical considerations. 2) Perspective Generation: Generate multiple contrasting ethical perspectives on the situation. 3) Ethical Debate: Simulate a debate between these perspectives, exploring potential consequences and moral implications. 4) Consensus Building: Prompt the model to synthesize a balanced, ethically-sound response that considers all perspectives. This approach aims to make the model more robust against subtle ethical manipulations by encouraging active ethical reasoning rather than relying on pre-defined rules.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the method on datasets designed to test ethical reasoning and bias in language models. Compare with baseline models and existing ethical AI approaches in terms of ethical consistency, bias mitigation, and ability to resist ethically manipulative prompts. Analyze the method's performance across different cultural and philosophical frameworks."
