        "Problem": "Most debiasing approaches focus on single-axis biases (e.g., gender or race), overlooking the compounded effects of multiple, intersecting social identities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods typically address bias along individual demographic dimensions separately.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting models to consider multiple, intersecting identities simultaneously, we can generate more nuanced and equitable representations of diverse individuals and groups.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Intersectional Fairness Prompting (IFP), a technique that: 1) Decomposes the input prompt into relevant social dimensions. 2) Generates a set of intersectional identity combinations. 3) For each combination, prompts the model to generate a response considering that specific intersectional perspective. 4) Aggregates these responses, highlighting commonalities and differences. 5) Prompts the model to synthesize a final response that equitably represents all intersectional perspectives.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare IFP with single-axis debiasing methods on existing and newly developed intersectional fairness benchmarks. Evaluate improvements in representation across various intersectional identity combinations while maintaining coherence and relevance to the original prompt."

        "Title": "Intersectional Fairness Prompting: Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models through Multi-Dimensional Perspective Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Current debiasing approaches for large language models (LLMs) typically focus on single-axis biases, overlooking the compounded effects of multiple, intersecting social identities. This limitation leads to incomplete and potentially biased representations of diverse individuals and groups in LLM outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods often address bias along individual demographic dimensions separately, which fails to capture the nuanced experiences of individuals with multiple marginalized identities. By explicitly prompting models to consider multiple, intersecting identities simultaneously, we can generate more equitable and comprehensive representations. This approach is inspired by intersectionality theory in social sciences, which emphasizes the interconnected nature of social categorizations and their impact on individuals' experiences.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Intersectional Fairness Prompting (IFP), a technique that decomposes input prompts into relevant social dimensions, generates a set of intersectional identity combinations, prompts the model to generate responses from each intersectional perspective, and synthesizes a final response that equitably represents all perspectives. The steps are: 1) Decompose the input prompt into relevant social dimensions. 2) Generate a set of intersectional identity combinations. 3) For each combination, prompt the model to generate a response considering that specific intersectional perspective. 4) Aggregate these responses, highlighting commonalities and differences. 5) Prompt the model to synthesize a final response that equitably represents all intersectional perspectives.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use existing datasets that cover diverse topics and require consideration of multiple social dimensions: 1) WinoBias for gender bias in coreference resolution, 2) StereoSet for measuring stereotypes across multiple dimensions, and 3) BBQ (Bias Benchmark for QA) for question-answering tasks involving multiple demographic attributes. We will also create a new Intersectional Fairness Benchmark (IFB) by adapting examples from these datasets to explicitly include intersectional scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement and evaluate single-axis debiasing methods as baselines: 1) Standard prompting without bias mitigation, 2) Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) for gender, 3) Bias-free word embeddings.",
            "Step 3: IFP Implementation": "Develop the IFP pipeline: a) Create a prompt template for decomposing input into social dimensions. b) Implement an algorithm to generate intersectional identity combinations. c) Design prompts for generating perspective-specific responses. d) Develop an aggregation method to highlight commonalities and differences. e) Create a prompt for synthesizing the final equitable response.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of IFP against baselines using: 1) Existing metrics from WinoBias, StereoSet, and BBQ. 2) New intersectional fairness metrics for IFB, including Intersectional Representation Score (IRS) and Equity Distribution Score (EDS). 3) Human evaluation on a subset of responses to assess overall fairness and quality.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of results, including: 1) Comparison of IFP performance across different intersectional combinations. 2) Examination of how IFP affects model outputs for various task types. 3) Investigation of potential limitations or unintended consequences of the IFP approach."

            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IFP Step 5)": "A successful entrepreneur is a resilient and adaptable individual who leverages their unique background, experiences, and skills to identify and address unmet needs in their community or market. They come from diverse backgrounds, spanning various intersections of gender, race, age, socioeconomic status, education, geography, and ability.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs demonstrate innovative problem-solving skills, often drawing inspiration from their personal experiences and challenges. They have a deep understanding of their target market, which may be influenced by their own intersectional identity. This connection allows them to create products or services that resonate with underserved populations or address overlooked issues.\n\nWhile traditional markers of success such as financial gain are important, many entrepreneurs also define success through their impact on their communities, personal growth, and ability to create opportunities for others. They often emphasize social responsibility and strive to give back to their communities or support other aspiring entrepreneurs from similar backgrounds.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs employ diverse strategies for building networks and social capital, adapting their approaches based on their unique circumstances and available resources. They may leverage community connections, industry-specific networks, or digital platforms to expand their reach and support systems.\n\nResilience is a key trait, as these individuals often face and overcome systemic barriers or biases related to their intersectional identities. They turn these challenges into strengths, using their unique perspectives to drive innovation and differentiate themselves in the market.\n\nEducational backgrounds vary among successful entrepreneurs, ranging from high school diplomas to advanced degrees. Regardless of formal education, they consistently demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning and skill development.\n\nUltimately, successful entrepreneurs are defined by their ability to create value, drive change, and persist in the face of obstacles. They represent a diverse tapestry of experiences and identities, each contributing to the rich landscape of entrepreneurship and innovation in their own unique way.",
            "Explanation": "The IFP method generates a more comprehensive and nuanced description of a successful entrepreneur by considering multiple intersectional perspectives. This approach reduces bias by explicitly including diverse experiences and challenges faced by entrepreneurs from various backgrounds, which are often overlooked in standard descriptions. The final synthesized response provides a more equitable representation that acknowledges the diverse paths to entrepreneurial success."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IFP method does not significantly improve over baselines in reducing bias and improving representation, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand the limitations. This may include examining whether certain intersectional combinations are consistently underrepresented or if the model struggles with specific types of intersectionality. We could then focus on developing targeted prompting strategies for these challenging cases. Additionally, we might explore combining IFP with other debiasing techniques, such as fine-tuning on diverse datasets or using adversarial debiasing methods. Another approach could be to investigate the impact of varying the number and types of intersectional combinations generated, potentially leading to insights on optimal prompting strategies for different tasks or domains. If these approaches do not yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of how different prompting strategies affect the representation of intersectional identities in LLM outputs, providing valuable insights for future research in this area."
