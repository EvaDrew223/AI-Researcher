    "idea_name": "Contrastive Stereotype Neutralization",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models struggle to generate content free from social stereotypes, especially for underrepresented groups.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current techniques often rely on carefully curated datasets or explicit bias statements.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting models to generate contrasting examples that challenge stereotypes, we can encourage more balanced and neutral outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our approach involves: 1) Identify potential stereotype: 'What stereotype might be associated with [group/individual]?' 2) Generate contrasting example: 'Provide an example that directly challenges this stereotype.' 3) Synthesize neutral description: 'Using the contrasting information, generate a balanced and stereotype-free description of [group/individual].' 4) Apply to task: 'Now, complete the original task using this neutral perspective.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test on various tasks including text generation, question answering, and summarization. Compare against standard prompting and existing debiasing methods using bias evaluation metrics and human evaluation for stereotyping reduction."

        "Title": "Contrasting Prompts: Reducing Social Biases and Stereotypes in Large Language Models through Stereotype-Challenging Examples",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often generate content that reinforces social stereotypes and biases, particularly for underrepresented groups. This perpetuates harmful societal prejudices and limits the models' ability to produce fair and inclusive outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing debiasing methods often rely on carefully curated datasets or explicit bias statements, which can be resource-intensive and may not generalize well. By prompting models to generate contrasting examples that challenge stereotypes, we can encourage more balanced and neutral outputs without the need for extensive data curation or model retraining. This approach leverages the model's own knowledge to counteract biases, potentially offering a more flexible and generalizable solution.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Contrasting Prompts, involves a four-step process: 1) Identify potential stereotype: We prompt the model to recognize potential stereotypes associated with a given group or individual. 2) Generate contrasting example: The model is then asked to provide an example that directly challenges this stereotype. 3) Synthesize neutral description: Using the contrasting information, we prompt the model to generate a balanced and stereotype-free description. 4) Apply to task: Finally, we instruct the model to complete the original task using this neutral perspective.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets to evaluate our method: 1) WinoBias for coreference resolution, 2) StereoSet for measuring stereotypical associations, and 3) BOLD for bias in open-ended language generation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Prompts": "For each task, we will implement three baseline prompting methods: a) Direct prompting (simply asking the model to complete the task), b) Explicit anti-bias instruction (e.g., 'Avoid stereotypes in your response'), and c) Few-shot examples of unbiased responses.",
            "Step 3: Contrasting Prompts Implementation": "For each task, we will implement our four-step Contrasting Prompts method. Example prompts for each step:\n1) 'What stereotype might be associated with [group/individual] in this context?'\n2) 'Provide an example that directly challenges this stereotype.'\n3) 'Using the contrasting information, generate a balanced and stereotype-free description of [group/individual].'\n4) 'Now, complete the original task using this neutral perspective.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use task-specific metrics for each dataset: 1) WinoBias: accuracy and bias score, 2) StereoSet: Language Model Score (LMS) and Stereotype Score (SS), 3) BOLD: Regard scores and toxicity measures using Perspective API.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "We will conduct a small-scale human evaluation on a subset of outputs (100 examples per task) to assess the effectiveness of our method in reducing perceived bias. Evaluators will rate outputs on a 5-point Likert scale for bias and stereotyping.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "We will compare the performance of Contrasting Prompts against the baselines across all metrics. We will also analyze the generated contrasting examples and neutral descriptions to understand the model's bias-reduction strategies."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Complete the sentence: The nurse walked into the room and she...",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The nurse walked into the room and she immediately began checking the patient's vital signs.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrasting Prompts; Step 1: Identify Stereotype)": "What stereotype might be associated with nurses in this context?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrasting Prompts; Step 1: Identify Stereotype)": "A common stereotype associated with nurses in this context is that they are typically female.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrasting Prompts; Step 2: Generate Contrasting Example)": "Provide an example that directly challenges this stereotype.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrasting Prompts; Step 2: Generate Contrasting Example)": "John, a male nurse with 10 years of experience, confidently entered the patient's room to perform a routine check-up.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrasting Prompts; Step 3: Synthesize Neutral Description)": "Using the contrasting information, generate a balanced and stereotype-free description of nurses.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrasting Prompts; Step 3: Synthesize Neutral Description)": "Nurses are healthcare professionals of any gender who provide patient care and support in various medical settings. They possess diverse backgrounds, experiences, and specialties within the nursing field.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Contrasting Prompts; Step 4: Apply to Task)": "Now, complete the original sentence using this neutral perspective: The nurse walked into the room and...",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Contrasting Prompts; Step 4: Apply to Task)": "The nurse walked into the room and promptly began assessing the patient's condition, demonstrating professional expertise regardless of gender.",
            "Explanation": "The Contrasting Prompts method generates a more neutral and less stereotypical completion by first identifying the potential stereotype, challenging it with a contrasting example, synthesizing a balanced description, and then applying this neutral perspective to the task. This results in a response that avoids reinforcing gender stereotypes associated with nurses."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the Contrasting Prompts method does not significantly reduce bias compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve categorizing the types of biases that persist and examining the generated contrasting examples and neutral descriptions. We could then modify our approach by: 1) Experimenting with different prompting strategies for each step, such as asking the model to generate multiple contrasting examples or neutral descriptions and selecting the best one. 2) Incorporating a self-consistency check where the model evaluates its own output for potential biases. 3) Exploring a multi-turn dialogue approach where the model iteratively refines its response based on feedback about potential biases. Additionally, we could pivot the project to focus on analyzing the model's ability to recognize and articulate stereotypes across different domains, which could provide valuable insights into the model's understanding of social biases."
