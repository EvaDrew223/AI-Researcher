    "idea_name": "Bias-Aware Collaborative Reasoning",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often propagate and amplify social biases and stereotypes in their outputs, especially when dealing with complex reasoning tasks involving diverse demographic groups.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on debiasing model parameters or using simple prompt engineering techniques.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of diverse team decision-making in human organizations, we propose a novel prompting method that simulates a collaborative reasoning process among multiple virtual agents with different demographic backgrounds and perspectives.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Bias-Aware Collaborative Reasoning (BACR), a multi-step prompting technique that creates a virtual panel of diverse 'experts' within the language model. Each expert is assigned a specific demographic background and area of expertise. The prompt instructs the model to generate responses from each expert's perspective, critically analyze these responses for potential biases, and then synthesize a final, balanced output. The process involves: 1) Defining the expert panel with diverse backgrounds. 2) Generating initial responses from each expert. 3) Cross-examination and bias identification among experts. 4) Collaborative refinement of responses. 5) Final synthesis of a balanced, bias-aware output.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate BACR against standard prompting and existing debiasing methods on tasks such as ethical decision-making, social impact assessment, and policy recommendations. We'll use established bias metrics and newly developed intersectional fairness measures to assess the reduction in stereotypes and biases across various demographic dimensions."

        "Title": "Bias-Aware Collaborative Reasoning: Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models through Multi-Agent Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often propagate and amplify social biases and stereotypes in their outputs, especially when dealing with complex reasoning tasks involving diverse demographic groups. This issue can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in various applications, from decision-making systems to content generation.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to mitigate biases in language models mainly focus on debiasing model parameters or using simple prompt engineering techniques. These methods often fall short in addressing complex, intersectional biases, particularly in reasoning tasks. Inspired by the concept of diverse team decision-making in human organizations, we propose a novel prompting method that simulates a collaborative reasoning process among multiple virtual agents with different demographic backgrounds and perspectives. This approach leverages the model's own capabilities to generate diverse viewpoints and critically analyze them, potentially leading to more balanced and less biased outputs.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for evaluation: 1) The Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) for assessing bias in social scenarios. 2) The Winogender dataset for evaluating gender bias in pronoun resolution. 3) A curated subset of the Ethics dataset focusing on ethical decision-making scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly asking the model to solve the task. 2) Bias-aware prompting: adding a simple instruction to avoid biases. 3) Diverse few-shot prompting: providing examples from diverse perspectives.",
            "Step 3: BACR Implementation": "Implement the BACR method with the following steps: 1) Expert Panel Definition: Create a prompt that defines 5-7 virtual experts with diverse demographic backgrounds (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) and areas of expertise relevant to the task. 2) Initial Response Generation: Prompt the model to generate initial responses from each expert's perspective. 3) Cross-examination: Create a prompt for experts to identify potential biases in each other's responses. 4) Collaborative Refinement: Prompt experts to refine their responses based on the identified biases. 5) Final Synthesis: Create a prompt for the model to synthesize a final, balanced output considering all expert inputs and refinements.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary model for evaluation, with GPT-3.5-turbo as a secondary model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "1) Bias Score: Use established bias metrics such as the Regard score for SBIC and accuracy differences across gender for Winogender. 2) Intersectional Fairness Measure: Develop a new metric that assesses bias across multiple demographic dimensions simultaneously. 3) Task Performance: Measure accuracy on the original task to ensure bias reduction doesn't compromise performance.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and task: 1) Run all baseline methods and BACR. 2) Collect outputs and compute evaluation metrics. 3) Perform statistical significance tests to compare BACR against baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "1) Quantitative Analysis: Compare BACR performance against baselines across all metrics. 2) Qualitative Analysis: Manually review a subset of outputs to identify patterns in bias reduction and any remaining biases. 3) Ablation Study: Test variations of BACR (e.g., different numbers of experts, removing certain steps) to understand the contribution of each component."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "A man and a woman are discussing a complex engineering problem. Who is more likely to come up with the correct solution?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on stereotypes, some might assume the man is more likely to solve the engineering problem. However, this assumption is biased and incorrect. Both men and women are equally capable of excelling in engineering and problem-solving. The correct solution could come from either the man or the woman, depending on their individual knowledge, experience, and skills, not their gender.",
            "BACR Prompt Input": "Task: A man and a woman are discussing a complex engineering problem. Who is more likely to come up with the correct solution?\n\nExpert Panel:\n1. Dr. Emily Chen: 35-year-old Asian-American female engineer\n2. James Thompson: 50-year-old African-American male sociologist\n3. Dr. Maria Rodriguez: 42-year-old Latina cognitive psychologist\n4. Alex Johnson: 28-year-old non-binary computer scientist\n5. Dr. Robert Smith: 60-year-old white male historian of science\n\nPlease provide initial responses from each expert, then conduct a cross-examination to identify biases, refine responses collaboratively, and synthesize a final, balanced output.",
            "BACR Prompt Expected Output": "Final Synthesized Response: After careful consideration and discussion among our diverse panel of experts, we conclude that the likelihood of coming up with the correct solution to a complex engineering problem is not determined by gender. Instead, it depends on various factors such as individual expertise, experience, knowledge of the specific problem domain, critical thinking skills, and creativity. Both the man and the woman have equal potential to solve the problem correctly. It's important to recognize and challenge our own biases and societal stereotypes that might lead us to assume one gender is more capable in certain fields. In reality, diversity in problem-solving teams, including gender diversity, often leads to more innovative and comprehensive solutions due to the variety of perspectives and approaches brought to the table. The key is to focus on individual merit and create inclusive environments that allow all individuals, regardless of gender or other demographic factors, to contribute their full potential in solving complex problems.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline response, while attempting to be unbiased, still frames the answer in terms of stereotypes and doesn't fully explore the complexity of the issue. The BACR method, on the other hand, provides a more nuanced and comprehensive response. It acknowledges various factors that contribute to problem-solving ability, emphasizes the importance of individual merit over gender, and highlights the value of diversity in problem-solving teams. The BACR response also addresses the broader context of societal biases and the need for inclusive environments, demonstrating a more thorough consideration of the issue from multiple perspectives."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If BACR doesn't significantly outperform baselines in reducing bias while maintaining task performance, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of the expert responses and cross-examinations to understand where biases persist or new biases emerge. This could lead to insights on the limitations of using LLMs to simulate diverse perspectives. 2) Experiment with different compositions of the expert panel, varying the number and types of experts, to see how this affects bias reduction. This could provide insights into optimal diversity configurations for collaborative reasoning. 3) Investigate how the model's responses change across different prompting strategies within the BACR framework, which could inform the development of more effective bias-reduction techniques. 4) Explore combining BACR with other debiasing methods, such as data augmentation or fine-tuning on balanced datasets, to create a hybrid approach. 5) Shift focus to developing more sophisticated metrics for measuring intersectional bias in language model outputs, which could be a valuable contribution to the field even if BACR itself doesn't outperform baselines."
