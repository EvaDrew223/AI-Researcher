        "Problem": "Large language models often generate biased or stereotypical content without being aware of their own biases.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly focus on dataset debiasing or model fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting models to critically examine their own outputs for potential biases, we can leverage their reasoning capabilities to self-correct.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting pipeline: 1) Generate initial response. 2) Prompt for bias self-analysis: 'Critically examine the previous response for potential social biases or stereotypes.' 3) Generate bias-aware revision: 'Rewrite the initial response to address the identified biases while maintaining factual accuracy.' 4) Verify improvement: 'Compare the original and revised responses, highlighting changes that reduce bias.'",

        "Title": "Self-Aware Prompting: Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models through Multi-Step Self-Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often generate biased or stereotypical content without being aware of their own biases, leading to the perpetuation of harmful social stereotypes and unfair representations in AI-generated content.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to reducing bias in language models primarily focus on dataset debiasing or model fine-tuning, which can be resource-intensive and may not fully address the dynamic nature of biases in different contexts. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models to critically examine their own outputs for potential biases, we can create a more flexible and generalizable approach to bias reduction. This self-aware prompting method has the potential to be more adaptable to various tasks and domains compared to static debiasing techniques.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a multi-step prompting pipeline that encourages the model to self-analyze and correct its own biases: 1) Generate an initial response to the given prompt. 2) Prompt for bias self-analysis: 'Critically examine the previous response for potential social biases or stereotypes.' 3) Generate a bias-aware revision: 'Rewrite the initial response to address the identified biases while maintaining factual accuracy.' 4) Verify improvement: 'Compare the original and revised responses, highlighting changes that reduce bias.'",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose bias-sensitive datasets for evaluation, including StereoSet and WinoBias. These datasets are designed to measure social biases in language models and cover various demographic attributes such as gender, race, and profession.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Prompting": "Implement standard prompting baselines: a) Direct prompting: Use the original prompts from the datasets without modification. b) Basic bias-aware prompting: Append 'Please ensure your response is unbiased and fair to all groups' to each prompt.",
            "Step 3: Implement Self-Aware Prompting": "Develop the multi-step prompting pipeline as described in the Proposed Method section. Use few-shot examples to guide the model through each step of the process.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments. These models represent state-of-the-art performance and are widely accessible.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following metrics: a) Bias scores from StereoSet and WinoBias. b) Accuracy on underlying tasks to ensure bias reduction doesn't compromise performance. c) Custom metric to measure the degree of change between original and revised responses.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Generate responses using baseline prompting methods. b) Generate responses using the self-aware prompting pipeline. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for both approaches.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of self-aware prompting against baselines. Analyze the types of biases identified and corrected, as well as any patterns in the model's self-analysis process.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing or modifying individual steps in the self-aware prompting pipeline to understand the contribution of each component."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Describe a typical nurse's daily routine.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A typical nurse's daily routine involves arriving at the hospital early in the morning, usually around 6 AM. She starts by receiving a report from the night shift nurse about the patients' conditions. Throughout her 12-hour shift, she administers medications, checks vital signs, changes dressings, and provides emotional support to patients and their families. She also assists doctors during rounds and procedures. The nurse spends a lot of time on her feet, moving between patient rooms and the nurses' station. She carefully documents all patient interactions and treatments in the medical records. At the end of her shift, she gives a detailed report to the incoming nurse before heading home, often tired but fulfilled by her caring work.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Describe a typical nurse's daily routine.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "[Same as Baseline Prompt Expected Output]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Bias Self-Analysis)": "Critically examine the previous response for potential social biases or stereotypes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Step 2: Bias Self-Analysis)": "The previous response contains several potential biases and stereotypes:\n1. Gender bias: The nurse is consistently referred to as 'she', reinforcing the stereotype that nursing is a female-dominated profession.\n2. Work schedule stereotype: The description assumes a 12-hour shift, which may not be typical for all nurses.\n3. Emotional labor emphasis: The response focuses on emotional support and 'caring work', which may reinforce stereotypes about nursing being primarily an emotional rather than a technical profession.\n4. Physical demands stereotype: The emphasis on being 'on her feet' and being 'tired' at the end of the shift may oversimplify the varied nature of nursing work.\n5. Limited scope: The description focuses on hospital work, neglecting other nursing environments like clinics, schools, or home health care.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Bias-Aware Revision)": "Rewrite the initial response to address the identified biases while maintaining factual accuracy.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Step 3: Bias-Aware Revision)": "A typical nurse's daily routine can vary depending on their specific role and work environment. In a hospital setting, nurses often begin their shift by receiving a report from the previous shift about patient conditions. Throughout their workday, which may range from 8 to 12 hours, nurses perform a variety of tasks including administering medications, monitoring vital signs, changing dressings, and providing patient care. They collaborate with doctors and other healthcare professionals during rounds and procedures. Nurses also spend time documenting patient interactions and treatments in medical records. The work can be both physically and mentally demanding, requiring a balance of technical skills and interpersonal abilities. Nurses may work in various settings beyond hospitals, such as clinics, schools, or providing home health care. At the end of their shift, they typically provide a detailed report to the incoming nurse. While the work can be challenging, many nurses find their profession rewarding due to the positive impact they have on patient health and well-being.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Verify Improvement)": "Compare the original and revised responses, highlighting changes that reduce bias.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (Step 4: Verify Improvement)": "The revised response addresses several biases present in the original:\n1. Gender neutrality: The revised version uses gender-neutral language, avoiding the assumption that all nurses are female.\n2. Diverse work schedules: It acknowledges that shift lengths can vary, rather than assuming a 12-hour shift for all nurses.\n3. Balanced skill representation: The revision emphasizes both technical skills and interpersonal abilities, providing a more comprehensive view of nursing responsibilities.\n4. Varied work environments: The new version mentions different settings where nurses may work, not just hospitals.\n5. Reduced stereotyping: The emotional aspects of the job are presented more objectively, avoiding the stereotype of nursing as primarily 'caring work'.\n6. Neutral language: The revised version uses more neutral language to describe the physical demands of the job.\nOverall, the revised response presents a more balanced, inclusive, and accurate representation of a nurse's daily routine, reducing potential biases and stereotypes.",
            "explanation": "The self-aware prompting method successfully identifies and addresses several biases in the initial response, resulting in a more balanced and inclusive description of a nurse's daily routine. This demonstrates the potential of the method to reduce social biases in language model outputs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed self-aware prompting method does not significantly reduce bias scores or compromises task performance, we can pursue the following alternatives: 1) Analyze the bias self-analysis step to understand why certain biases are not being identified. This could involve creating a taxonomy of biases and checking which types are consistently missed. 2) Experiment with different phrasings for each step of the prompting pipeline to see if certain formulations are more effective at eliciting unbiased responses. 3) Introduce an additional step where the model generates multiple alternative revisions and then selects the least biased one, potentially improving the quality of the final output. 4) If the method proves ineffective across multiple domains, we could pivot to a comparative study analyzing why self-analysis fails for bias detection in language models, which could provide valuable insights for future bias mitigation strategies."
