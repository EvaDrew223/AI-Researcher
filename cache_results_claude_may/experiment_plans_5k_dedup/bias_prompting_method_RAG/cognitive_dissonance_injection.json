    "topic_description": "novel prompting methods to reduce social biases and stereotypes of large language models",
    "idea_name": "Cognitive Dissonance Injection",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often reinforce existing biases and stereotypes due to their training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on dataset balancing or post-processing techniques to mitigate biases.",
        "Motivation": "Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we propose to leverage the concept of cognitive dissonance to challenge and reduce biases in language model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cognitive Dissonance Injection (CDI), a novel prompting technique that deliberately introduces conflicting information or perspectives to create 'cognitive dissonance' within the language model's reasoning process. The method involves: 1) Identifying potential biases in the initial prompt or task. 2) Generating conflicting evidence or counter-examples that challenge these biases. 3) Injecting this dissonant information into an expanded prompt. 4) Instructing the model to reconcile the conflicting information and generate a more balanced, bias-aware response. 5) Iteratively applying this process to refine the output further.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CDI against standard prompting and existing debiasing methods on tasks such as sentiment analysis, occupation prediction, and social attribute inference. We'll use established bias metrics and develop new measures to assess the reduction in stereotypical associations and the increase in nuanced, balanced outputs across various demographic dimensions."

        "Title": "Cognitive Dissonance Injection: Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models through Novel Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often reinforce existing social biases and stereotypes due to their training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outputs. This problem is particularly concerning as these models are increasingly used in various applications that can impact people's lives.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to mitigate biases in language models typically focus on dataset balancing or post-processing techniques, which may not fully address the underlying reasoning processes of the models. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we propose to leverage the concept of cognitive dissonance to challenge and reduce biases in language model outputs. By introducing conflicting information or perspectives, we aim to create a 'cognitive dissonance' within the model's reasoning process, potentially leading to more balanced and less biased responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cognitive Dissonance Injection (CDI), a novel prompting technique that deliberately introduces conflicting information or perspectives to create 'cognitive dissonance' within the language model's reasoning process. The method involves five steps: 1) Identifying potential biases in the initial prompt or task. 2) Generating conflicting evidence or counter-examples that challenge these biases. 3) Injecting this dissonant information into an expanded prompt. 4) Instructing the model to reconcile the conflicting information and generate a more balanced, bias-aware response. 5) Iteratively applying this process to refine the output further.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use three datasets for evaluation: 1) The Bias in Bios dataset for occupation prediction, 2) The StereoSet dataset for measuring stereotypical associations, and 3) The Social Bias Frames dataset for social bias inference.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Prompts": "For each task, we will create standard prompts without CDI. For example, for occupation prediction: 'Given the following biography, predict the person's occupation: [BIO]'",
            "Step 3: CDI Prompt Construction": "For each task, we will create CDI prompts following these steps: a) Identify potential biases (e.g., gender stereotypes in occupation prediction). b) Generate conflicting evidence (e.g., statistics showing gender diversity in various occupations). c) Inject dissonant information (e.g., 'Consider that women make up 50% of doctors in country X'). d) Instruct reconciliation (e.g., 'Considering both the biography and the conflicting information, provide an unbiased prediction of the person's occupation.')",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: a) Run baseline prompts and collect outputs. b) Run CDI prompts and collect outputs. c) For CDI, we will perform 3 iterations of the process, refining the prompt each time based on the previous output.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "We will use the following metrics: 1) For Bias in Bios: accuracy and demographic parity. 2) For StereoSet: stereotype score and language modeling score. 3) For Social Bias Frames: F1 score for bias detection and bias type classification. We will also conduct a qualitative analysis of a sample of outputs to assess the effectiveness of CDI in reducing biases.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of baseline prompts vs. CDI prompts across all metrics. Analyze how the outputs change across iterations of CDI. Investigate any cases where CDI doesn't improve or worsens bias."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Given the following biography, predict the person's occupation: 'Sarah has always been passionate about helping others. She spent years studying human anatomy and physiology, and now works long hours in a fast-paced environment where quick decisions can make a huge difference.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on the biography, Sarah's occupation is likely a doctor or surgeon.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Consider the following biography: 'Sarah has always been passionate about helping others. She spent years studying human anatomy and physiology, and now works long hours in a fast-paced environment where quick decisions can make a huge difference.' Now, consider these additional facts: 1) In many countries, women make up over 50% of medical school graduates. 2) There are successful individuals of all genders in various medical specialties. 3) Assumptions about gender in medical professions can lead to biased patient care. Given both the biography and these additional considerations, provide an unbiased prediction of Sarah's occupation, explaining your reasoning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Based on the biography and the additional considerations, Sarah could be a doctor, surgeon, nurse practitioner, or another healthcare professional. The biography suggests a medical profession due to the study of anatomy and physiology, long hours, and fast-paced environment. However, it's important not to assume her specific role based on gender stereotypes. Sarah could be in any medical specialty or related field that requires this background and work environment. The key is to focus on the skills and experiences mentioned, rather than making assumptions based on gender.",
            "Explanation": "The CDI prompt introduces conflicting information about gender representation in medical professions, challenging potential gender biases. This leads to a more nuanced and less biased response that considers multiple possibilities and explicitly acknowledges the importance of avoiding gender-based assumptions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CDI method doesn't significantly reduce biases compared to baseline prompts, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This could involve: 1) Analyzing the generated conflicting evidence to ensure it's relevant and impactful. 2) Examining cases where CDI fails to reduce bias, looking for patterns or specific types of biases that are more resistant to this method. 3) Experimenting with different ways of injecting cognitive dissonance, such as using more or less explicit contradictions, or varying the strength of the conflicting information. 4) Investigating whether the models are genuinely reconciling the conflicting information or simply ignoring it. Based on these analyses, we could refine the CDI method or propose alternative approaches that address the identified shortcomings. Additionally, we could expand the project to include a comparative study of different debiasing techniques, positioning CDI within the broader landscape of bias mitigation strategies for language models."
