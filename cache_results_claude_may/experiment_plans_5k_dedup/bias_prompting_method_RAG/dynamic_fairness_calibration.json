        "Problem": "Static debiasing approaches often fail to address context-specific biases that emerge in different scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most current methods apply fixed debiasing strategies regardless of the specific context or task.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically adjusting the debiasing strategy based on the task and context, we can achieve more nuanced and effective bias mitigation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a three-stage prompting process: 1) Context analysis: 'Analyze the given task and identify potential areas where bias might occur.' 2) Strategy selection: 'Based on the analysis, recommend specific debiasing strategies relevant to this context.' 3) Guided execution: 'Complete the task while actively applying the recommended debiasing strategies. Explain your choices.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on a diverse set of tasks with varying potential for bias (e.g., resume screening, news summarization, character description). Compare against fixed debiasing prompts and unprompted baselines, measuring both bias reduction and task performance."

        "Title": "Dynamic Context-Aware Debiasing: A Three-Stage Prompting Approach for Mitigating Social Biases in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Static debiasing approaches often fail to address context-specific biases that emerge in different scenarios when using large language models. This limitation can lead to the perpetuation of social biases and stereotypes in various applications of language models.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically apply fixed debiasing strategies regardless of the specific context or task, which can be ineffective or even counterproductive in certain situations. By dynamically adjusting the debiasing strategy based on the task and context, we can achieve more nuanced and effective bias mitigation. This approach leverages the language model's ability to analyze context and adapt its responses, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable debiasing across diverse scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a three-stage prompting process for dynamic context-aware debiasing:\n1. Context Analysis: Prompt the model to analyze the given task and identify potential areas where bias might occur.\n2. Strategy Selection: Based on the analysis, prompt the model to recommend specific debiasing strategies relevant to this context.\n3. Guided Execution: Prompt the model to complete the task while actively applying the recommended debiasing strategies, explaining its choices.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of tasks with varying potential for bias, including:\na) Resume screening dataset: Collect or create a dataset of fictional resumes with varying demographic information.\nb) News summarization dataset: Use a subset of a news article dataset, ensuring diversity in topics and potential biases.\nc) Character description dataset: Create a dataset of character descriptions for various fictional scenarios.\n\nEnsure each dataset has ground truth labels or expert-annotated bias assessments for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline approaches:\na) Unprompted baseline: Use the language model to perform tasks without any debiasing prompts.\nb) Fixed debiasing prompt: Develop a general-purpose debiasing prompt to be used across all tasks.",
            "Step 3: Dynamic Debiasing Implementation": "Implement the three-stage prompting process:\na) Context Analysis prompt: 'Analyze the following task and identify potential areas where social biases or stereotypes might occur: [TASK DESCRIPTION]'\nb) Strategy Selection prompt: 'Based on the previous analysis, recommend specific debiasing strategies relevant to this context: [CONTEXT ANALYSIS]'\nc) Guided Execution prompt: 'Complete the following task while actively applying the recommended debiasing strategies. Explain your choices: [TASK DESCRIPTION] [DEBIASING STRATEGIES]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments, as it represents a state-of-the-art large language model.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task in the dataset:\na) Generate responses using the unprompted baseline.\nb) Generate responses using the fixed debiasing prompt.\nc) Generate responses using the three-stage dynamic debiasing approach.\nStore all generated responses for evaluation.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the outputs using the following metrics:\na) Bias reduction: Use established bias measurement techniques (e.g., SEAT, WEAT) or expert human evaluation to assess the level of bias in the outputs.\nb) Task performance: Measure the quality of the outputs in terms of relevance and correctness for the given task.\nc) Explanation quality: For the dynamic debiasing approach, evaluate the quality and relevance of the explanations provided.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the dynamic debiasing approach against the baselines across different tasks and contexts. Analyze patterns in strategy selection and their effectiveness in reducing bias while maintaining task performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1: Resume Screening": {
                "Input": "Review the following resume and provide a brief assessment of the candidate's qualifications:\n\nName: Emily Johnson\nEducation: Bachelor's in Computer Science, Stanford University\nExperience: 3 years as a Software Engineer at Tech Co.\nSkills: Python, Java, Machine Learning, Agile methodologies",
                "Baseline Output": "Emily Johnson appears to be a well-qualified candidate with a strong educational background from Stanford University and relevant work experience as a Software Engineer. Her skills in Python, Java, and Machine Learning are valuable in today's tech industry. Overall, she seems like a promising candidate for software engineering positions.",
                "Dynamic Debiasing Output": "Context Analysis: This task involves reviewing a resume, which can be prone to gender and name-based biases. The candidate's name (Emily Johnson) may trigger unconscious biases related to gender in tech fields.\n\nStrategy Selection: 1) Focus on qualifications and experience rather than personal information. 2) Use gender-neutral language. 3) Compare skills and experience to job requirements rather than making assumptions based on background.\n\nGuided Execution: The candidate presents strong qualifications for a software engineering position. They hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, indicating a solid educational foundation. With 3 years of experience as a Software Engineer at Tech Co., the candidate has practical industry experience. Their skills in Python, Java, Machine Learning, and Agile methodologies align well with current industry demands. To provide an unbiased assessment, I've focused on the candidate's qualifications and experience without making assumptions based on their name or potential gender. The candidate's background suggests they could be a strong contender for software engineering roles, particularly those involving machine learning or requiring a mix of programming languages.",
                "Explanation": "The dynamic debiasing approach first identifies potential sources of bias, then selects strategies to mitigate these biases. In the execution, it focuses on qualifications and uses gender-neutral language, providing a more objective assessment compared to the baseline output."
            },
            "Example 2: News Summarization": {
                "Input": "Summarize the following news article:\n\nTitle: 'Inner-city youth program shows promising results'\nBody: A new after-school program targeting at-risk youth in inner-city neighborhoods has shown significant improvements in academic performance and reduced involvement in criminal activities. The program, which offers tutoring, mentorship, and recreational activities, has been running for 18 months in five major cities...",
                "Baseline Output": "A new after-school program for inner-city youth has demonstrated positive outcomes, including improved academic performance and decreased criminal activity among participants. The program, which has been operating in five major cities for 18 months, offers tutoring, mentorship, and recreational activities to at-risk youth in urban areas.",
                "Dynamic Debiasing Output": "Context Analysis: This news article summary task could potentially reinforce stereotypes about inner-city youth, crime, and academic performance. There's a risk of overgeneralizing or using loaded language that perpetuates biases.\n\nStrategy Selection: 1) Use neutral language when describing the program's participants and location. 2) Focus on the program's specific activities and measured outcomes rather than broad generalizations. 3) Avoid implying causation where only correlation might exist.\n\nGuided Execution: An after-school program implemented in urban areas across five major cities has reported positive outcomes after 18 months of operation. The program, which provides tutoring, mentorship, and recreational activities, aims to support youth in these communities. According to the report, participants have shown improvements in academic performance. Additionally, the study noted a correlation between program participation and reduced involvement in criminal activities among the youth. These results suggest the potential benefits of structured after-school programs in supporting young people's educational and personal development. However, it's important to note that these are initial findings, and further research may be needed to fully understand the program's long-term impacts and the factors contributing to its reported success.",
                "Explanation": "The dynamic debiasing approach identifies potential stereotypes and biases in reporting on inner-city youth programs. It then applies strategies to use more neutral language, focus on specific program details, and avoid overgeneralization. The resulting summary is more balanced and avoids reinforcing stereotypes while still conveying the key information from the article."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed dynamic debiasing method does not show significant improvements over the baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of why context-aware debiasing is challenging for language models. This could involve examining the model's context analysis capabilities, the relevance and applicability of suggested debiasing strategies, and the model's ability to implement these strategies effectively. We could also explore how different types of biases are handled across various contexts, potentially uncovering patterns in where the approach succeeds or fails. Additionally, we could investigate whether certain types of tasks or contexts are more amenable to this approach than others, which could inform future research directions in context-aware debiasing techniques."
