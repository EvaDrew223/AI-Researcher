    "topic_description": "novel prompting methods to reduce social biases and stereotypes of large language models",
    "idea_name": "Empathetic Perspective Expansion",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often generate text that lacks empathy or understanding for marginalized or underrepresented groups, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on removing biased language rather than actively promoting empathy and understanding.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to actively consider and empathize with diverse perspectives, we can generate more inclusive and compassionate outputs that challenge existing biases.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Empathetic Perspective Expansion (EPE), a prompting technique that: 1) Identifies potentially marginalized or stereotyped groups relevant to the input prompt. 2) For each identified group, prompts the model to generate a first-person narrative expressing that group's perspective and experiences. 3) Prompts the model to reflect on these narratives, identifying common humanity and challenging stereotypes. 4) Generates a final response to the original prompt that incorporates these empathetic insights and promotes a more inclusive representation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate EPE against standard prompting and existing debiasing methods on tasks involving social descriptions and scenario generation. Measure improvements in empathetic language, reduction of stereotypes, and increased representation of diverse perspectives while maintaining coherence and relevance to the original prompt."

        "Title": "Empathetic Perspective Expansion: Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models through Diverse Narrative Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often generate text that perpetuates harmful stereotypes and lacks empathy for marginalized or underrepresented groups. This problem stems from biases in training data and the models' inability to actively consider diverse perspectives when generating responses.",
        "Motivation": "Existing debiasing methods typically focus on removing biased language rather than actively promoting empathy and understanding. By prompting the model to consider and empathize with diverse perspectives, we can generate more inclusive and compassionate outputs that challenge existing biases. This approach leverages the model's ability to generate narratives and reflect on them, potentially leading to more nuanced and empathetic responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Empathetic Perspective Expansion (EPE), a prompting technique that consists of four main steps: 1) Identify potentially marginalized or stereotyped groups relevant to the input prompt. 2) For each identified group, generate a first-person narrative expressing that group's perspective and experiences. 3) Prompt the model to reflect on these narratives, identifying common humanity and challenging stereotypes. 4) Generate a final response to the original prompt that incorporates these empathetic insights and promotes a more inclusive representation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two datasets for evaluation: 1) The Bias in Bios dataset, which contains biographies with gender bias. 2) The StereoSet dataset, which evaluates language model bias across four domains: gender, profession, race, and religion.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: 1) Standard prompting: directly asking the model to complete the task. 2) Disclaimer prompting: adding a disclaimer to avoid biases. 3) Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA): augmenting prompts with gender-swapped versions.",
            "Step 3: Implement EPE": "Develop prompts for each step of the EPE method: a) Group identification: 'Identify potentially marginalized or stereotyped groups relevant to this prompt: [PROMPT]' b) Narrative generation: 'Generate a brief first-person narrative from the perspective of [GROUP]: [PROMPT]' c) Reflection: 'Reflect on these narratives, identifying common humanity and challenging stereotypes:' d) Final response: 'Using the insights from the reflection, provide an empathetic and inclusive response to the original prompt:'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments, as it represents the current state-of-the-art in language modeling capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics: 1) Bias score from the StereoSet benchmark. 2) Percentage of gender-stereotypical adjectives in generated biographies. 3) Human evaluation of empathy and inclusivity on a 5-point Likert scale.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and method (baselines and EPE): a) Generate responses for all prompts. b) Calculate bias scores and stereotypical adjective percentages. c) Conduct human evaluation on a subset of responses.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of EPE against baselines across all metrics. Analyze specific examples to understand how EPE changes the model's outputs. Investigate any trade-offs between bias reduction and task performance."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Write a short biography for a successful entrepreneur.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "John is a driven and ambitious entrepreneur who founded a successful tech startup in Silicon Valley. With his sharp business acumen and innovative ideas, he quickly rose to the top of the industry. Known for his ruthless negotiation tactics and long work hours, John built his company into a multi-billion dollar enterprise, cementing his status as a titan of the business world.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (EPE Step 1: Group Identification)": "Identify potentially marginalized or stereotyped groups relevant to this prompt: Write a short biography for a successful entrepreneur.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (EPE Step 1)": "1. Women entrepreneurs\n2. Entrepreneurs from racial or ethnic minorities\n3. Entrepreneurs with disabilities\n4. LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs\n5. Entrepreneurs from developing countries",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (EPE Step 2: Narrative Generation)": "Generate a brief first-person narrative from the perspective of a woman entrepreneur: Write a short biography for a successful entrepreneur.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (EPE Step 2)": "As a woman in the male-dominated tech industry, I faced numerous challenges on my path to success. Despite being overlooked for funding opportunities and battling stereotypes about my capabilities, I persevered. My innovative approach to sustainable energy solutions not only revolutionized the industry but also paved the way for more diverse voices in entrepreneurship. Balancing my roles as a CEO and a mother taught me invaluable lessons about efficiency and empathy in leadership.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (EPE Step 3: Reflection)": "Reflect on these narratives, identifying common humanity and challenging stereotypes:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (EPE Step 3)": "These narratives highlight that successful entrepreneurship is not limited to any single demographic. Common themes of perseverance, innovation, and adaptability emerge across diverse experiences. Stereotypes about who can be a successful entrepreneur are challenged by the varied paths to success. The narratives emphasize that unique perspectives and experiences can lead to innovative solutions and business approaches. Empathy, resilience, and the ability to overcome systemic barriers are key traits shared by many successful entrepreneurs, regardless of their background.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (EPE Step 4: Final Response)": "Using the insights from the reflection, provide an empathetic and inclusive response to the original prompt: Write a short biography for a successful entrepreneur.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (EPE Step 4)": "Meet Alex, a visionary entrepreneur whose journey defies traditional narratives of success. Growing up in a working-class family, Alex's diverse background inspired a unique approach to problem-solving. Their startup, focused on accessible technology for individuals with disabilities, grew from a personal passion into a global enterprise. Alex's leadership style, characterized by empathy and inclusivity, fostered a company culture that celebrates diversity and innovation. Balancing professional ambitions with personal commitments, Alex demonstrates that success in entrepreneurship comes in many forms. Their story inspires aspiring entrepreneurs from all walks of life to pursue their dreams and make a positive impact on the world.",
            "Explanation": "The EPE method generates a more inclusive and empathetic biography compared to the baseline. It avoids gender stereotypes, considers diverse backgrounds, and highlights qualities like empathy and inclusivity that are often overlooked in traditional entrepreneur narratives. The final output challenges common biases and presents a more nuanced view of entrepreneurial success."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the EPE method does not significantly reduce bias or improve empathy scores compared to baselines, we will conduct a detailed error analysis to understand why. This may involve examining the intermediate outputs (group identification, narratives, and reflections) to identify where the process might be falling short. We could then explore modifications to the prompting strategy, such as providing more specific guidelines for narrative generation or reflection. Additionally, we might investigate combining EPE with other debiasing techniques, such as CDA, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. If these attempts still don't yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper. This could involve a comprehensive study of how different prompting strategies affect bias and empathy in language model outputs, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of various approaches to addressing social biases in AI."
