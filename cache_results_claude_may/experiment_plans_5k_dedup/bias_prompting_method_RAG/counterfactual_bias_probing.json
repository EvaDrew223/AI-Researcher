    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit social biases and stereotypes in their outputs, particularly when generating text about underrepresented groups.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically involve fine-tuning on debiased datasets or using simple prompts to encourage unbiased outputs.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to generate counterfactual scenarios where social roles are reversed, we can probe for biases and encourage more equitable representations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Bias Probing (CBP), a multi-step prompting technique: 1) Given an initial prompt, generate a response. 2) Identify potential biases in the response. 3) Create a counterfactual prompt by reversing social roles (e.g., swapping genders or ethnicities). 4) Generate a response to the counterfactual prompt. 5) Compare the original and counterfactual responses to identify discrepancies. 6) Prompt the model to reconcile these discrepancies and generate a final, debiased response that treats both scenarios equitably.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CBP against standard prompting and existing debiasing methods on benchmark datasets for social bias in text generation. Measure improvements in equality of representation across demographic groups while maintaining overall text quality and coherence."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Bias Probing: Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models through Multi-Step Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit social biases and stereotypes in their outputs, particularly when generating text about underrepresented groups. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory content, perpetuating harmful societal biases. Existing debiasing methods typically involve fine-tuning on debiased datasets or using simple prompts, which may not fully address the complex nature of social biases.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to reducing bias in language models often rely on dataset manipulation or simple prompting techniques, which may not effectively capture the nuanced nature of social biases. By introducing a multi-step prompting technique that leverages counterfactual scenarios, we can probe for biases more effectively and encourage the model to generate more equitable representations. This method takes advantage of the model's ability to reason about different scenarios without requiring extensive fine-tuning or data collection.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Bias Probing (CBP), a multi-step prompting technique that consists of the following steps: 1) Given an initial prompt, generate a response. 2) Identify potential biases in the response. 3) Create a counterfactual prompt by reversing social roles (e.g., swapping genders or ethnicities). 4) Generate a response to the counterfactual prompt. 5) Compare the original and counterfactual responses to identify discrepancies. 6) Prompt the model to reconcile these discrepancies and generate a final, debiased response that treats both scenarios equitably.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select benchmark datasets for social bias in text generation. We will use the StereoSet dataset for measuring stereotypical biases and the WinoBias dataset for gender bias in coreference resolution. Additionally, we'll create a custom dataset of prompts designed to elicit potentially biased responses across various domains (e.g., occupations, leadership roles, family dynamics).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct query to the model), b) Simple bias-aware prompting (e.g., 'Provide an unbiased response to the following prompt:'), c) Existing debiasing method like INLP (Iterative Nullspace Projection) for comparison.",
            "Step 3: CBP Implementation": "Implement the Counterfactual Bias Probing method with the following sub-steps: a) Initial response generation, b) Bias identification (using a pre-defined list of bias indicators or a separate model), c) Counterfactual prompt generation, d) Counterfactual response generation, e) Discrepancy analysis, f) Final debiased response generation.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source BLOOM-176B model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement the following evaluation metrics: a) Stereotype Score from StereoSet, b) WinoBias score, c) Perplexity to measure language quality, d) Human evaluation for a subset of responses (fairness and quality ratings).",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Generate responses using all baseline methods and CBP, b) Calculate evaluation metrics for all methods, c) Perform statistical significance tests to compare CBP against baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Conduct in-depth analysis of the results, including: a) Comparison of CBP performance against baselines across different bias types and domains, b) Analysis of the intermediate steps in CBP (e.g., effectiveness of counterfactual generation), c) Investigation of cases where CBP performs particularly well or poorly.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in the CBP process, such as removing the discrepancy analysis step or varying the number of counterfactual scenarios generated."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Describe a typical day in the life of a nurse.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "A typical day for a nurse begins early in the morning. She arrives at the hospital and starts her shift by reviewing patient charts and discussing care plans with the doctor. Throughout the day, she administers medications, changes dressings, and monitors patients' vital signs. She spends a lot of time on her feet, moving from room to room to check on her patients. The nurse also provides emotional support to patients and their families, explaining procedures and answering questions. She carefully documents all treatments and observations in the patients' records. At the end of her shift, she gives a detailed report to the incoming nurse before heading home, often tired but satisfied with her caring work.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Initial Response)": "Describe a typical day in the life of a nurse.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Initial Response)": "[Same as Baseline Output]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Bias Identification)": "Identify any potential gender biases or stereotypes in the following description of a nurse's typical day: [Insert Initial Response]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Bias Identification)": "The description contains gender bias by consistently referring to the nurse as 'she', implying that nursing is a predominantly female profession. This reinforces the stereotype that nursing is a woman's job.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Counterfactual Prompt)": "Describe a typical day in the life of a male nurse.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Counterfactual Prompt)": "A typical day for a male nurse begins early in the morning. He arrives at the hospital and starts his shift by reviewing patient charts and discussing care plans with the doctor. Throughout the day, he administers medications, changes dressings, and monitors patients' vital signs. He spends a lot of time on his feet, moving from room to room to check on his patients. The nurse also provides emotional support to patients and their families, explaining procedures and answering questions. He carefully documents all treatments and observations in the patients' records. At the end of his shift, he gives a detailed report to the incoming nurse before heading home, often tired but satisfied with his caring work.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Discrepancy Analysis)": "Compare the following two descriptions of a nurse's typical day and identify any discrepancies in how they are portrayed based on gender: [Insert Initial Response and Counterfactual Response]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4: Discrepancy Analysis)": "The two descriptions are nearly identical in terms of the tasks and responsibilities described. The only significant difference is the use of gendered pronouns ('she' in the first description and 'he' in the second). This highlights that the job duties and experiences of nurses are the same regardless of gender, and the initial bias was in the assumption of the nurse's gender.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 5: Final Debiased Response)": "Based on the analysis of potential biases and the comparison of gendered descriptions, provide a debiased description of a typical day in the life of a nurse that avoids reinforcing gender stereotypes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 5: Final Debiased Response)": "A typical day for a nurse begins early in the morning. The nurse arrives at the hospital and starts the shift by reviewing patient charts and discussing care plans with the doctor. Throughout the day, they administer medications, change dressings, and monitor patients' vital signs. Nurses spend a lot of time on their feet, moving from room to room to check on patients. They also provide emotional support to patients and their families, explaining procedures and answering questions. Nurses carefully document all treatments and observations in the patients' records. At the end of the shift, they give a detailed report to the incoming nurse before heading home, often tired but satisfied with their caring work. Nursing is a diverse profession, with practitioners of all genders contributing their skills and compassion to patient care.",
            "Explanation": "The CBP method successfully identified the gender bias in the initial response, created a counterfactual scenario, and then produced a final debiased response that avoids gender stereotypes while maintaining the accuracy of the nurse's daily activities. This demonstrates how CBP can lead to more inclusive and equitable representations in language model outputs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CBP method does not significantly outperform baselines, we will conduct a thorough analysis to understand why. This may include: 1) Examining the quality and relevance of the generated counterfactual scenarios to ensure they effectively probe for biases. 2) Analyzing the model's ability to identify biases in its own outputs and whether this self-analysis is accurate. 3) Investigating whether the final reconciliation step is effectively incorporating the insights from the counterfactual analysis. Based on these findings, we could modify the CBP method, for example, by incorporating external bias detection tools or fine-tuning a smaller model specifically for bias identification. Additionally, we could explore combining CBP with other debiasing techniques, such as data augmentation or targeted fine-tuning, to create a hybrid approach. If these modifications do not yield significant improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of why large language models struggle with self-correction of biases, potentially uncovering valuable insights about the limitations and challenges in AI debiasing efforts."
