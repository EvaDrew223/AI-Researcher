    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models often have difficulty identifying subtle forms of bias and determining appropriate boundaries for fair representation.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on predefined rules or datasets to identify biases, which may miss nuanced cases.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting models to actively explore and reason about ethical boundaries, we can develop more sophisticated and context-aware debiasing capabilities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a prompting sequence: 1) Boundary identification: 'What are potential ethical concerns or biases in discussing [topic]?' 2) Edge case generation: 'Generate examples that push the boundaries of fair representation without crossing into clear bias.' 3) Ethical analysis: 'For each example, explain why it may or may not be considered biased.' 4) Principle extraction: 'Based on this analysis, formulate general principles for avoiding bias in this context.' 5) Guided application: 'Now, address the original task while applying these principles.'",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on tasks involving sensitive topics or groups. Compare against models using fixed ethical guidelines and unprompted baselines. Measure reduction in bias, appropriateness of content, and ability to handle edge cases as judged by human evaluators and existing bias metrics."

        "Title": "Ethical Boundary Exploration: A Novel Prompting Method for Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to identify subtle forms of bias and determine appropriate boundaries for fair representation, particularly in discussions involving sensitive topics or marginalized groups.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to reducing bias in language models typically rely on predefined rules or datasets, which may miss nuanced cases of bias. By prompting models to actively explore and reason about ethical boundaries, we can develop more sophisticated and context-aware debiasing capabilities that adapt to various situations and topics.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a five-step prompting sequence to guide language models in exploring ethical boundaries and reducing bias: 1) Boundary identification: Prompt the model to identify potential ethical concerns or biases related to the topic. 2) Edge case generation: Ask the model to generate examples that push the boundaries of fair representation without crossing into clear bias. 3) Ethical analysis: For each example, prompt the model to explain why it may or may not be considered biased. 4) Principle extraction: Based on the analysis, ask the model to formulate general principles for avoiding bias in this context. 5) Guided application: Finally, prompt the model to address the original task while applying these principles.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that involve sensitive topics or discussions about marginalized groups. We will use: a) The StereoSet dataset for measuring bias in language models. b) The Social Bias Frames dataset for analyzing social bias in online discussions. c) A subset of the Reddit Controversial Comments dataset for real-world examples of potentially biased language.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods for comparison: a) Standard prompting: Directly prompt the model to complete the task without any bias-related instructions. b) Simple bias warning: Append a general instruction to 'avoid biased language' to the prompt.",
            "Step 3: Implement Proposed Method": "For each example in the datasets, apply the five-step prompting sequence: a) Boundary identification: 'What are potential ethical concerns or biases in discussing [topic]?' b) Edge case generation: 'Generate 3 examples that push the boundaries of fair representation regarding [topic] without crossing into clear bias.' c) Ethical analysis: 'For each example, explain why it may or may not be considered biased.' d) Principle extraction: 'Based on this analysis, formulate 3 general principles for avoiding bias when discussing [topic].' e) Guided application: 'Now, address the original task while applying these principles: [original task description]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for our experiments. We'll also include the open-source LLAMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance: a) Bias scores from StereoSet and Social Bias Frames datasets. b) Human evaluation of a subset of outputs (100 examples per method) on a 1-5 scale for bias, fairness, and appropriateness. c) Perplexity on the task to ensure the model remains coherent and on-topic.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model combination: a) Run the baseline methods and record results. b) Apply the proposed five-step prompting method and record results. c) Calculate evaluation metrics for all methods.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of the proposed method against the baselines: a) Quantitative analysis: Compare bias scores, human evaluation ratings, and perplexity across methods. b) Qualitative analysis: Examine a subset of outputs to identify patterns in how the proposed method affects language and content. c) Principle analysis: Analyze the principles generated by the model to identify common themes and strategies for bias reduction."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Prompting)": "Write a short paragraph about the role of women in the workplace.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Prompting)": "Women play a crucial role in the modern workplace, contributing their skills and expertise across various industries. As more women enter traditionally male-dominated fields, they bring diverse perspectives and innovative ideas. However, challenges such as the gender pay gap and work-life balance issues persist, highlighting the need for continued efforts to achieve true equality in the professional world.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Simple Bias Warning)": "Write a short paragraph about the role of women in the workplace. Avoid using biased language.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Simple Bias Warning)": "In today's workplace, individuals of all genders contribute significantly to organizational success. Women, like their colleagues, bring valuable skills, experiences, and perspectives to various industries. While progress has been made towards equality, it's important to recognize that challenges related to fair compensation and work-life balance continue to affect many professionals. Ongoing efforts to create inclusive environments benefit everyone and lead to more innovative and productive workplaces.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Ethical Boundary Exploration; Step 1: Boundary Identification)": "What are potential ethical concerns or biases in discussing the role of women in the workplace?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Ethical Boundary Exploration; Step 1: Boundary Identification)": "1. Stereotyping: Assuming all women have the same experiences or preferences in the workplace. 2. Undervaluing contributions: Failing to recognize the full range of skills and expertise women bring to their roles. 3. Ignoring intersectionality: Overlooking how factors like race, age, or socioeconomic background intersect with gender in workplace experiences. 4. Perpetuating the gender binary: Excluding non-binary individuals from the discussion. 5. Victimization narrative: Focusing solely on challenges without acknowledging progress and achievements.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Ethical Boundary Exploration; Step 5: Guided Application)": "Based on the ethical principles we've discussed, write a short paragraph about the role of individuals across the gender spectrum in the workplace, ensuring fair representation and avoiding bias.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Ethical Boundary Exploration; Step 5: Guided Application)": "In contemporary workplaces, individuals across the gender spectrum make valuable contributions that drive innovation and success. Research shows that diverse teams, including those with gender diversity, often outperform homogeneous groups in problem-solving and creativity. While progress has been made towards equality, it's important to recognize that experiences vary widely based on intersecting factors such as race, age, and socioeconomic background. Organizations that prioritize inclusive policies and practices, such as equitable hiring and promotion processes, flexible work arrangements, and comprehensive parental leave, create environments where all employees can thrive. By valuing the unique perspectives and skills of each individual, regardless of gender identity, workplaces can foster innovation, improve employee satisfaction, and achieve better business outcomes.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed method guides the model to actively consider potential biases and ethical concerns, leading to a more nuanced and inclusive response. It avoids stereotyping, acknowledges diversity within gender categories, and focuses on concrete actions and benefits of inclusivity rather than generalizations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly reduce bias compared to baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why the method failed and what it reveals about the model's understanding of bias. We could examine: 1) The quality and relevance of the ethical concerns and principles generated by the model. 2) How the model's responses change across the five steps, identifying where biases persist or new ones emerge. 3) The model's ability to apply abstract ethical principles to concrete situations. 4) Differences in performance across topics or types of bias, which could reveal blind spots in the model's training. Additionally, we could experiment with variations of the method, such as providing pre-defined ethical principles or using a multi-model approach where one model generates principles and another applies them."
