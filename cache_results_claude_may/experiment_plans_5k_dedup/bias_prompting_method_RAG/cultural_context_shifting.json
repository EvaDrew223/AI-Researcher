    "idea_name": "Cultural Context Shifting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often default to Western-centric perspectives and norms, leading to biased representations of non-Western cultures and contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically involve fine-tuning on diverse datasets or using simple prompts to encourage cultural sensitivity.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly prompting the model to consider diverse cultural contexts and shift its frame of reference, we can generate more globally inclusive and equitable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Cultural Context Shifting (CCS), a prompting technique that: 1) Identifies the cultural context implied in the original prompt. 2) Generates a set of alternative cultural contexts relevant to the topic. 3) For each context, prompts the model to reframe the query from that cultural perspective. 4) Generates responses for each culturally reframed query. 5) Synthesizes these responses into a final output that acknowledges and respects diverse cultural perspectives.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare CCS with standard prompting and existing cultural debiasing methods on a newly developed benchmark for cross-cultural text generation. Evaluate improvements in cultural diversity and sensitivity of outputs while maintaining relevance to the original query."

        "Title": "Cultural Context Shifting: Enhancing Global Inclusivity in Large Language Model Outputs",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often default to Western-centric perspectives and norms, leading to biased representations of non-Western cultures and contexts. This bias can result in outputs that are culturally insensitive, inaccurate, or exclusionary when addressing global topics or interacting with users from diverse cultural backgrounds.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to mitigate cultural bias in language models typically involve fine-tuning on diverse datasets or using simple prompts to encourage cultural sensitivity. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the nuanced perspectives of various cultures. By explicitly prompting the model to consider diverse cultural contexts and shift its frame of reference, we can generate more globally inclusive and equitable outputs. This approach leverages the model's existing knowledge while encouraging a more thoughtful and culturally aware response generation process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Cultural Context Shifting (CCS), a prompting technique that consists of five steps: 1) Identify the cultural context implied in the original prompt. 2) Generate a set of alternative cultural contexts relevant to the topic. 3) For each context, prompt the model to reframe the query from that cultural perspective. 4) Generate responses for each culturally reframed query. 5) Synthesize these responses into a final output that acknowledges and respects diverse cultural perspectives.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a diverse test set of 500 prompts covering various domains (e.g., history, social norms, traditions, values) from different cultural perspectives. Ensure representation from at least 10 distinct cultural regions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct query to the model), b) Simple cultural sensitivity prompt (e.g., 'Please provide a culturally sensitive answer'), and c) Few-shot prompting with culturally diverse examples.",
            "Step 3: Implement CCS": "Develop prompts for each step of the CCS method. For example: Step 1: 'Identify the cultural context implied in this query: [QUERY]' Step 2: 'Generate 3 alternative cultural contexts relevant to this topic: [TOPIC]' Step 3: 'Reframe the following query from the perspective of [CULTURAL CONTEXT]: [QUERY]' Step 4: 'Answer the following culturally reframed query: [REFRAMED QUERY]' Step 5: 'Synthesize the following responses into a single, culturally inclusive answer: [RESPONSES]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments, as it has demonstrated strong performance in following complex instructions.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Develop a rubric for assessing cultural inclusivity and sensitivity. Metrics should include: a) Cultural Diversity Score (1-5 scale), b) Factual Accuracy (1-5 scale), c) Stereotyping Avoidance (1-5 scale), d) Contextual Appropriateness (1-5 scale).",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit a diverse panel of 20 cultural experts to evaluate a subset of 100 responses from each method using the developed rubric.",
            "Step 7: Automated Evaluation": "Implement an automated evaluation using GPT-4 to assess all 500 prompts across all methods. Prompt GPT-4 to act as a cultural sensitivity expert and rate responses based on the developed rubric.",
            "Step 8: Comparative Analysis": "Compare the performance of CCS against the baseline methods using both human and automated evaluations. Conduct statistical significance tests to validate improvements.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Study": "Perform an ablation study by removing each step of CCS to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance.",
            "Step 10: Error Analysis": "Analyze cases where CCS underperforms to identify potential limitations and areas for improvement."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1 (Baseline Failure)": {
                "Input": "Describe the concept of family in society.",
                "Baseline Output": "Family is typically defined as a nuclear unit consisting of parents and their children living together in a single household. It is the foundation of society where individuals learn social norms, values, and behaviors. In most Western societies, the family unit is seen as independent, with a focus on individual achievement and personal growth.",
                "Explanation": "This baseline response presents a Western-centric view of family, neglecting diverse family structures and values present in other cultures."
            },
            "Example 2 (CCS Success)": {
                "Input": "Describe the concept of family in society.",
                "CCS Step 1 Output": "The query implies a Western perspective on family structure.",
                "CCS Step 2 Output": "1. East Asian context 2. African context 3. Middle Eastern context",
                "CCS Step 3 Output": "1. From an East Asian perspective, describe the concept of family in society. 2. From an African perspective, describe the concept of family in society. 3. From a Middle Eastern perspective, describe the concept of family in society.",
                "CCS Step 4 Output": "1. In East Asian societies, family often extends beyond the nuclear unit to include multiple generations living together or in close proximity. There's a strong emphasis on filial piety, collective responsibility, and maintaining harmony within the family. 2. In many African cultures, the concept of family is broad and inclusive, often encompassing extended family members and even entire communities. The idea of 'ubuntu' - 'I am because we are' - reflects the interconnectedness of family and society. 3. In Middle Eastern societies, family is often seen as the core social unit, with strong emphasis on honor, loyalty, and collective identity. Extended family networks play a crucial role in social support and decision-making.",
                "CCS Step 5 Output": "The concept of family in society varies significantly across cultures. While some societies may emphasize nuclear family units, many cultures around the world have broader, more inclusive definitions of family. In East Asian contexts, multi-generational households and filial piety are common. African perspectives often extend the concept of family to entire communities, embodying the principle of 'ubuntu'. Middle Eastern societies typically place great importance on extended family networks and collective honor. These diverse perspectives highlight that family structures and values are deeply influenced by cultural, historical, and social factors, and no single definition can encompass the global understanding of family.",
                "Explanation": "The CCS method successfully identifies multiple cultural perspectives, generates culturally-specific descriptions, and synthesizes them into a comprehensive, culturally inclusive response that acknowledges diverse family structures and values."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCS method does not significantly outperform baseline methods, we will pivot to an in-depth analysis of where and why the method falls short. This could involve: 1) Examining the quality and diversity of generated alternative cultural contexts to ensure they are truly representative and distinct. 2) Analyzing the reframing process to see if the model is effectively shifting perspectives or merely paraphrasing. 3) Investigating the synthesis step to determine if important cultural nuances are being lost. Based on these analyses, we could develop a modified version of CCS that addresses identified weaknesses, such as incorporating a cultural knowledge base to guide context generation or implementing a more structured synthesis process. Additionally, we could explore combining CCS with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to enhance its performance. If improvements remain marginal, we could refocus the project on providing a detailed analysis of the challenges in prompting for cultural inclusivity, offering insights for future research in this area."
