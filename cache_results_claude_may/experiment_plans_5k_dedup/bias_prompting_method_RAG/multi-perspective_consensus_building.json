        "Title": "Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting for Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often generate biased content from a single, potentially skewed perspective, leading to the perpetuation of social biases and stereotypes in their outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically focus on individual-level debiasing rather than considering multiple viewpoints. By simulating diverse perspectives and finding consensus, we can produce more balanced and less biased outputs. This method leverages the model's own capabilities to generate and critique multiple viewpoints, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable debiasing across various topics and domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method involves a four-step process: 1) Perspective generation: Prompt the model to generate 3-5 diverse perspectives on a given topic, ensuring representation of different demographic groups. 2) Critique phase: For each perspective, identify potential biases or limitations. 3) Synthesis: Integrate the perspectives, addressing the identified biases, to create a balanced view on the topic. 4) Consensus check: Evaluate if the synthesized view fairly represents all perspectives and adjust if necessary.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a diverse set of topics prone to social biases from existing datasets such as StereoSet, CrowS-Pairs, and Social IQa. Ensure a mix of subjects including gender, race, age, and socioeconomic status.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: a) Direct prompting (no debiasing), b) Single-perspective generation with a generic 'avoid bias' instruction, c) Simple aggregation of multiple perspectives without the critique and synthesis steps.",
            "Step 3: Implement Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting": "For each topic, apply the following steps: a) Perspective generation: Prompt 'Generate 3-5 diverse perspectives on [topic], ensuring representation of different demographic groups.' b) Critique phase: For each perspective, prompt 'Identify potential biases or limitations in this perspective.' c) Synthesis: Prompt 'Integrate the perspectives, addressing the identified biases, to create a balanced view on [topic].' d) Consensus check: Prompt 'Evaluate if the synthesized view fairly represents all perspectives. Adjust if necessary.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI API for the main experiments. Additionally, test on open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B-chat for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "a) Use existing bias metrics such as the Stereotype Score from StereoSet and the bias score from CrowS-Pairs. b) Implement a diversity of viewpoints metric by calculating the semantic similarity between generated perspectives. c) Conduct a small-scale human evaluation (e.g., 100 samples) to judge the fairness and balance of the final outputs.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "a) For each topic in the dataset, generate outputs using all baseline methods and the proposed method. b) Apply the evaluation metrics to all outputs. c) Conduct statistical analysis to compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Compare the bias scores, diversity scores, and human evaluation results across methods. b) Analyze cases where the proposed method succeeds or fails compared to baselines. c) Investigate the impact of the number of perspectives generated on the final output quality."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Describe the role of women in the workplace.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Women in the workplace often take on supportive roles such as administrative assistants or human resources professionals. They are known for their multitasking abilities and interpersonal skills, which make them well-suited for these positions. However, they may face challenges in advancing to leadership roles due to family responsibilities.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting; Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "Generate 3-5 diverse perspectives on the role of women in the workplace, ensuring representation of different demographic groups.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting; Step 1: Perspective Generation)": "1. Traditional perspective: Women are valuable in supportive roles, bringing empathy and communication skills to the workplace. They excel in fields like education and healthcare.\n2. Progressive perspective: Women are equally capable in all roles, including leadership and STEM fields. Gender should not define career paths or opportunities.\n3. Intersectional feminist perspective: Women's experiences in the workplace vary greatly based on factors like race, class, and sexual orientation. We must consider these intersections when discussing women's roles.\n4. Male ally perspective: Men should actively support women's advancement in the workplace by advocating for equal pay, mentoring, and challenging sexist attitudes.\n5. Economic perspective: Increasing women's participation and leadership in the workforce has significant positive impacts on economic growth and company performance.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting; Step 2: Critique Phase)": "For each perspective generated on the role of women in the workplace, identify potential biases or limitations.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting; Step 2: Critique Phase)": "1. Traditional perspective: Bias - Reinforces gender stereotypes and limits women's potential. Ignores individual differences and changing societal norms.\n2. Progressive perspective: Limitation - May oversimplify the challenges women face and ignore persistent systemic barriers.\n3. Intersectional feminist perspective: Limitation - While comprehensive, it may be complex to implement in practice and could lead to overgeneralization of group experiences.\n4. Male ally perspective: Bias - Centers men's role in women's advancement, potentially diminishing women's agency.\n5. Economic perspective: Limitation - Focuses primarily on economic benefits, potentially overlooking social and personal impacts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting; Step 3: Synthesis)": "Integrate the perspectives on the role of women in the workplace, addressing the identified biases, to create a balanced view on the topic.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting; Step 3: Synthesis)": "The role of women in the workplace is multifaceted and evolving. Women, like all individuals, have diverse skills, interests, and capabilities that suit them for a wide range of roles across all sectors and levels of organizations. While traditionally associated with certain fields or positions, it's crucial to recognize that these associations are often based on societal constructs rather than inherent abilities. Women have proven their competence in leadership, STEM fields, and all areas of work.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge that women's experiences in the workplace are not uniform. Factors such as race, class, sexual orientation, and other intersecting identities significantly impact their opportunities and challenges. Recognizing these differences is crucial for creating truly inclusive work environments.\n\nAdvancing women's roles in the workplace requires a collective effort. This includes challenging gender stereotypes, addressing systemic barriers, and actively supporting women's career development. Male allies play an important role in this process, although the focus should remain on empowering women rather than centering men's contributions.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that increasing women's participation and leadership in the workforce has demonstrated positive impacts on economic growth and organizational performance. However, the value of women in the workplace extends beyond economic metrics to include social progress, diverse perspectives in decision-making, and personal fulfillment.\n\nIn essence, the role of women in the workplace should be one of equal opportunity, respect, and recognition, acknowledging both the progress made and the ongoing challenges to be addressed.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting; Step 4: Consensus Check)": "Evaluate if the synthesized view on the role of women in the workplace fairly represents all perspectives. Adjust if necessary.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Perspective Consensus Prompting; Step 4: Consensus Check)": "The synthesized view effectively incorporates elements from all perspectives while addressing most of the identified biases. It acknowledges women's diverse capabilities, the impact of intersectionality, the role of allies, and the economic benefits of women's participation in the workforce. The synthesis also balances traditional associations with the need for progress and equal opportunities.\n\nHowever, to ensure full representation, we could make a minor adjustment to more explicitly address the ongoing challenges women face in the workplace, such as unequal pay, underrepresentation in certain fields, and work-life balance issues. This would better reflect the progressive and intersectional feminist perspectives.\n\nAdjusted final paragraph:\n'In essence, the role of women in the workplace should be one of equal opportunity, respect, and recognition. While significant progress has been made, it's crucial to continue addressing persistent challenges such as pay gaps, underrepresentation in certain fields, and work-life balance issues. By acknowledging both the achievements and the ongoing obstacles, we can work towards a more equitable and inclusive work environment for all.'",
            "explanation": "The multi-perspective consensus prompting method generates a more comprehensive and balanced view of women's roles in the workplace compared to the baseline. It acknowledges diverse capabilities, considers intersectionality, recognizes progress while noting ongoing challenges, and avoids reinforcing stereotypes. The final output is less likely to perpetuate social biases and provides a more nuanced understanding of the topic."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-perspective consensus prompting method doesn't significantly reduce bias compared to baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Analyze the generated perspectives to understand if the diversity is sufficient or if we need to modify the prompting to encourage even more diverse viewpoints. 2) Investigate whether the bias is being introduced in a particular step of the process (e.g., perspective generation vs. synthesis) and focus on improving that specific step. 3) Experiment with different ways of combining the perspectives, such as weighted averaging based on the critique phase results. 4) Expand the analysis to understand how the method performs across different types of biases (e.g., gender vs. racial vs. age biases) to identify if it's more effective for certain categories. 5) Explore combining our method with other debiasing techniques, such as using debiased embeddings or fine-tuning on balanced datasets, to create a hybrid approach. These alternative directions could turn the project into a comprehensive analysis of multi-perspective approaches to debiasing, providing valuable insights even if the original hypothesis is not fully supported."
