    "idea_name": "Vernacular Code-Switching Prompts",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with understanding and generating text in vernacular languages or dialects, particularly when mixed with standard language varieties.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most approaches focus on either standard languages or specific dialects, but rarely address code-switching between them.",
        "Motivation": "Many speakers naturally switch between standard and vernacular forms. By explicitly modeling this behavior in prompts, we can improve model performance on real-world language use.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a dynamic prompting technique that incorporates code-switching patterns: 1) Dialect Identification: Prompt the model to identify the dialect or vernacular elements in the input. 2) Code-Switching Generation: Based on the identified elements, construct a prompt that alternates between standard and vernacular forms, mirroring natural code-switching patterns. 3) Response Synthesis: Use this code-switched prompt to guide the model in generating a response that appropriately blends standard and vernacular elements.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Create a new dataset of code-switched conversations across multiple language pairs with varying levels of vernacular usage. Evaluate the method against standard multilingual models and monolingual vernacular models on tasks such as sentiment analysis and response generation."

        "Title": "Dynamic Code-Switching Prompting for Improved Performance on Multilingual and Vernacular Language Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle with understanding and generating text in vernacular languages or dialects, particularly when mixed with standard language varieties. This issue is especially pronounced in real-world scenarios where speakers naturally switch between standard and vernacular forms.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically focus on either standard languages or specific dialects, but rarely address code-switching between them. By explicitly modeling code-switching behavior in prompts, we can potentially improve model performance on real-world language use. This approach leverages the model's existing knowledge of both standard and vernacular forms, encouraging it to blend them appropriately in its responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce a dynamic prompting technique that incorporates code-switching patterns: 1) Dialect Identification: Prompt the model to identify the dialect or vernacular elements in the input. 2) Code-Switching Generation: Based on the identified elements, construct a prompt that alternates between standard and vernacular forms, mirroring natural code-switching patterns. 3) Response Synthesis: Use this code-switched prompt to guide the model in generating a response that appropriately blends standard and vernacular elements.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Creation": "Create a new dataset of code-switched conversations across multiple language pairs with varying levels of vernacular usage. Focus on 3-5 language pairs, each with at least 1000 examples. Include a mix of social media posts, transcribed conversations, and written texts. Annotate each example with the standard and vernacular elements.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Selection": "Choose GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 as the primary models for evaluation. Also include at least one open-source multilingual model like XLM-R or mT5 for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Prompting": "Implement three baseline prompting methods: 1) Direct prompting with the input text, 2) Few-shot prompting with examples of code-switched text, and 3) Instruction-based prompting asking the model to handle code-switched text.",
            "Step 4: Dynamic Code-Switching Prompt Construction": "For each input, create a dynamic prompt as follows: a) Dialect Identification: 'Identify the dialect or vernacular elements in the following text: [INPUT]' b) Code-Switching Generation: 'Generate a prompt that alternates between standard [LANGUAGE] and [DIALECT] forms, based on the following elements: [IDENTIFIED ELEMENTS]' c) Response Synthesis: 'Using the following code-switched prompt as a guide, generate a response that appropriately blends standard and vernacular elements: [CODE-SWITCHED PROMPT]'",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Tasks": "Implement two main evaluation tasks: 1) Sentiment Analysis: Classify the sentiment of code-switched text. 2) Response Generation: Generate appropriate responses to code-switched inputs.",
            "Step 6: Metrics": "For sentiment analysis, use accuracy and F1-score. For response generation, use BLEU and BERTScore, as well as human evaluation for a subset of responses (focusing on appropriateness of code-switching and overall coherence).",
            "Step 7: Experiment Execution": "Run each model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and the open-source model) on both tasks using all prompting methods (baselines and proposed method). Use a subset of 100 examples for initial testing and the full dataset for final results.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Compare the performance of each method across models and tasks. Analyze where the dynamic code-switching prompting method performs better or worse than baselines. Examine specific examples to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Translate the following Spanglish text to standard English: 'Yo estaba walking down la calle when I saw un perro muy cute.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "I was walking down the street when I saw a very cute dog.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Dynamic Code-Switching Prompting; Step 1: Dialect Identification)": "Identify the dialect or vernacular elements in the following text: 'Yo estaba walking down la calle when I saw un perro muy cute.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Dynamic Code-Switching Prompting; Step 1: Dialect Identification)": "The text contains Spanglish elements, mixing Spanish and English. Spanish elements: 'Yo estaba', 'la calle', 'un perro muy'. English elements: 'walking down', 'when I saw', 'cute'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Dynamic Code-Switching Prompting; Step 2: Code-Switching Generation)": "Generate a prompt that alternates between standard English and Spanish forms, based on the following elements: Spanish: 'Yo estaba', 'la calle', 'un perro muy'. English: 'walking down', 'when I saw', 'cute'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Dynamic Code-Switching Prompting; Step 2: Code-Switching Generation)": "Translate the following text, maintaining a similar level of code-switching between English and Spanish: 'I was caminando por the street cuando vi a very lindo dog.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Dynamic Code-Switching Prompting; Step 3: Response Synthesis)": "Using the following code-switched prompt as a guide, generate a response that appropriately blends standard and vernacular elements: 'Translate the following text, maintaining a similar level of code-switching between English and Spanish: \"I was caminando por the street cuando vi a very lindo dog.\"' Original text: 'Yo estaba walking down la calle when I saw un perro muy cute.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Dynamic Code-Switching Prompting; Step 3: Response Synthesis)": "I was walking por la street when I vio a very cute perro.",
            "Explanation": "The dynamic code-switching prompting method allows for a more nuanced translation that maintains the code-switching style of the original text, while the baseline method produces a standard English translation without preserving the bilingual nature of the input."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed dynamic code-switching prompts do not significantly improve performance over baselines, we can pivot the project to an analysis of code-switching patterns in LLM outputs. We would examine the generated responses to understand how models handle code-switching in different contexts and language pairs. This analysis could include: 1) Quantifying the frequency and patterns of code-switching in model outputs compared to human-generated text. 2) Identifying specific linguistic features or contexts that trigger code-switching in model responses. 3) Comparing code-switching behavior across different model sizes and architectures. 4) Investigating potential biases in how models represent different dialects or vernacular forms. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the multilingual capabilities of LLMs and inform future approaches to handling code-switched language."
