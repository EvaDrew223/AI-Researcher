    "idea_name": "Cross-Lingual Concept Mapping",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models struggle with accurate translation and understanding of culturally specific concepts and idioms in low-resource languages.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on direct translation or multilingual pretraining, which can miss nuanced cultural meanings.",
        "Motivation": "By mapping concepts across languages based on their underlying semantic meaning rather than literal translations, we can better capture and transfer cultural nuances.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting method: 1) Concept Extraction: Prompt the model to identify key concepts and their cultural context in the source language. 2) Cross-Lingual Mapping: Use another prompt to find semantically equivalent concepts or explanations in the target language, even if they differ lexically. For example, translating 'It's raining cats and dogs' would first extract the concept of 'heavy rain' and then find an equivalent idiom in the target language.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on a new benchmark of culturally-specific phrases and idioms across multiple language pairs. Compare against standard machine translation baselines and multilingual models."

        "Title": "Cross-Lingual Concept Mapping for Improved Translation of Cultural Nuances",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models struggle with accurate translation and understanding of culturally specific concepts and idioms in low-resource languages and vernacular languages. This leads to loss of cultural nuances and misinterpretation of context-dependent expressions.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches often rely on direct translation or multilingual pretraining, which can miss nuanced cultural meanings. By mapping concepts across languages based on their underlying semantic meaning rather than literal translations, we can better capture and transfer cultural nuances. This method leverages the LLM's understanding of concepts in high-resource languages to improve performance on low-resource languages.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a two-stage prompting method: 1) Concept Extraction: Prompt the model to identify key concepts and their cultural context in the source language. 2) Cross-Lingual Mapping: Use another prompt to find semantically equivalent concepts or explanations in the target language, even if they differ lexically. For example, translating 'It's raining cats and dogs' would first extract the concept of 'heavy rain' and then find an equivalent idiom in the target language.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a benchmark dataset of culturally-specific phrases and idioms across multiple language pairs. Include high-resource to low-resource language pairs (e.g., English to Swahili) and pairs between low-resource languages (e.g., Yoruba to Vietnamese). Collect at least 1000 examples per language pair, ensuring a diverse range of cultural expressions.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct translation using a state-of-the-art neural machine translation model (e.g., Google Translate API). 2) Use a multilingual LLM (e.g., mT5 or XLM-R) for zero-shot translation.",
            "Step 3: Concept Extraction Prompt Design": "Design a prompt for the concept extraction stage. Example: 'Identify the key concept and cultural context in the following phrase: [SOURCE_PHRASE]. Explain its meaning without using culturally specific terms.'",
            "Step 4: Cross-Lingual Mapping Prompt Design": "Design a prompt for the cross-lingual mapping stage. Example: 'Given the concept [EXTRACTED_CONCEPT], find an equivalent expression or explanation in [TARGET_LANGUAGE] that conveys the same meaning, even if it uses different words or imagery.'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 as the primary model for both concept extraction and cross-lingual mapping stages. Also test with GPT-3.5-turbo for comparison.",
            "Step 6: Implementation of Proposed Method": "For each example in the dataset: a) Apply the concept extraction prompt to the source phrase. b) Use the output from (a) as input for the cross-lingual mapping prompt. c) Generate the final translation based on the mapped concept.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Use the following metrics: 1) BLEU score for lexical similarity to reference translations. 2) BERTScore for semantic similarity. 3) Human evaluation on a subset of 100 examples per language pair, rating translations on a 1-5 scale for cultural accuracy and meaning preservation.",
            "Step 8: Experiment Execution": "Run the baselines and proposed method on the entire dataset. Use batched API calls to GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo for efficiency.",
            "Step 9: Results Analysis": "Compare the performance of the proposed method against baselines using the defined metrics. Conduct statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-test) to verify improvements.",
            "Step 10: Error Analysis": "Manually analyze a sample of cases where the proposed method performs worse than baselines to identify potential areas for improvement."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Translation)": "Translate the following English phrase to French: 'It's raining cats and dogs.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Translation)": "Il pleut des chats et des chiens.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Concept Extraction)": "Identify the key concept and cultural context in the following phrase: 'It's raining cats and dogs.' Explain its meaning without using culturally specific terms.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Concept Extraction)": "Key concept: Extremely heavy rainfall. Cultural context: This is an English idiom used to describe unusually heavy rain. Explanation: The phrase indicates that it is raining very heavily, with an intensity that is much greater than normal rainfall.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Cross-Lingual Mapping)": "Given the concept 'Extremely heavy rainfall', find an equivalent expression or explanation in French that conveys the same meaning, even if it uses different words or imagery.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Cross-Lingual Mapping)": "In French, an equivalent expression for extremely heavy rainfall would be 'Il pleut des cordes', which literally translates to 'It's raining ropes'. This idiom conveys the same idea of rain falling in long, heavy streams, similar to ropes hanging from the sky.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed method successfully extracts the core concept of the idiom and finds a culturally appropriate equivalent in the target language, preserving the meaning better than a direct translation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring the challenges of cross-lingual concept mapping. We would analyze the intermediate outputs (extracted concepts and mapped expressions) to understand where the method falls short. This could involve categorizing types of cultural expressions that are particularly challenging to map across languages, or investigating how the quality of concept extraction affects the final translation. We could also explore combining our method with existing translation models, using the extracted concepts as additional context for neural machine translation systems. Additionally, we might investigate how the performance varies across different language pairs and cultural domains, which could provide insights into the linguistic and cultural factors that influence the effectiveness of our approach."
