    "idea_name": "Multi-Modal Cultural Context Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often lack the cultural context necessary to accurately interpret and generate text in low-resource languages, leading to culturally inappropriate or misunderstood outputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches typically rely solely on text data, which may not capture the full richness of cultural context, especially for languages with limited textual resources.",
        "Motivation": "By incorporating multi-modal cultural information into prompts, we can provide richer context for low-resource languages and improve the model's cultural understanding and generation capabilities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-modal cultural context prompting technique: 1) Visual Context Extraction: Use vision-language models to extract cultural information from images related to the target language and culture. 2) Audio Context Integration: Incorporate prosodic and tonal information from audio samples of the language. 3) Cultural Knowledge Fusion: Combine the extracted visual and audio information with textual cultural knowledge into a comprehensive prompt. 4) Culturally-Informed Generation: Use this rich, multi-modal cultural prompt to guide the model in generating culturally appropriate and contextually relevant responses.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Create a new multi-modal dataset for low-resource languages, including text, images, and audio. Evaluate the method on tasks such as culturally-sensitive translation, dialogue generation, and cultural event description, comparing against text-only baselines and human judgments of cultural appropriateness."

        "Title": "Multi-Modal Cultural Context Prompting for Improved Language Model Performance on Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often lack the cultural context necessary to accurately interpret and generate text in low-resource languages, leading to culturally inappropriate or misunderstood outputs. This problem is particularly acute for languages with limited textual resources, where the richness of cultural context is not fully captured in the available training data.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches typically rely solely on text data, which may not capture the full richness of cultural context, especially for languages with limited textual resources. By incorporating multi-modal cultural information into prompts, we can provide richer context for low-resource languages and improve the model's cultural understanding and generation capabilities. This approach is inspired by the fact that human understanding of culture is inherently multi-modal, involving visual, auditory, and textual information. By mimicking this multi-modal approach, we aim to enhance the cultural competence of language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-modal cultural context prompting technique that consists of four main steps: 1) Visual Context Extraction: Use vision-language models to extract cultural information from images related to the target language and culture. 2) Audio Context Integration: Incorporate prosodic and tonal information from audio samples of the language. 3) Cultural Knowledge Fusion: Combine the extracted visual and audio information with textual cultural knowledge into a comprehensive prompt. 4) Culturally-Informed Generation: Use this rich, multi-modal cultural prompt to guide the model in generating culturally appropriate and contextually relevant responses.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a new multi-modal dataset for low-resource languages, including text, images, and audio. Select 3-5 low-resource languages from different language families. For each language, collect 1000 samples, each consisting of: a) A text prompt in the target language, b) 3-5 culturally relevant images, c) A short audio clip (5-10 seconds) of native speech, d) A reference translation or expected output in English.",
            "Step 2: Visual Context Extraction": "Use a pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) to extract visual features and generate textual descriptions of the culturally relevant images. For each image, generate a short description (1-2 sentences) that captures cultural elements.",
            "Step 3: Audio Context Integration": "Use a pre-trained speech recognition model (e.g., Whisper) to transcribe the audio clips and extract prosodic features. Generate a short description (1-2 sentences) of the audio characteristics, including tone, rhythm, and any notable linguistic features.",
            "Step 4: Cultural Knowledge Fusion": "Combine the extracted visual and audio information with additional textual cultural knowledge (e.g., from Wikipedia or cultural databases) into a comprehensive prompt. The prompt structure should be: '[Original text prompt] Visual context: [Image descriptions] Audio context: [Audio description] Cultural background: [Additional cultural information]'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection and Baseline Establishment": "Select a large language model (e.g., GPT-4) for the experiments. Establish baselines by testing the model on the dataset using: a) Direct prompting (original text only), b) Text-only cultural context prompting (adding textual cultural information).",
            "Step 6: Multi-Modal Cultural Context Prompting": "Apply the proposed multi-modal cultural context prompting technique to the selected model. Use the comprehensive prompts created in Step 4 to guide the model in generating responses.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "Evaluate the model's performance using the following metrics: a) BLEU and ROUGE scores for translation tasks, b) Perplexity for language modeling tasks, c) Human evaluation for cultural appropriateness and contextual relevance (recruit native speakers or cultural experts). Compare the results with the baselines established in Step 5.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of each component of the multi-modal prompt: a) Visual context only, b) Audio context only, c) Visual + Audio context without additional cultural information.",
            "Step 9: Analysis and Reporting": "Analyze the results, identifying patterns in performance across different languages and types of tasks. Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and insights gained from the experiments."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Translate the following Yoruba proverb to English: 'Aja to ba ma sonu, kii gbo fere olode.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "A dog that will get lost doesn't hear the hunter's whistle.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Multi-Modal Cultural Context Prompting)": "Translate the following Yoruba proverb to English: 'Aja to ba ma sonu, kii gbo fere olode.' Visual context: An image of a traditional Yoruba hunter with a whistle, surrounded by dense forest. Another image shows a local breed of dog commonly used in hunting. Audio context: A short audio clip of the proverb being spoken in Yoruba, with a rhythmic, melodic intonation typical of Yoruba speech. Cultural background: In Yoruba culture, hunting is a traditional occupation, and dogs play a crucial role in this practice. Proverbs are highly valued as a means of conveying wisdom and life lessons.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Multi-Modal Cultural Context Prompting)": "The dog destined to get lost will not heed the hunter's whistle. This proverb emphasizes the idea that one cannot escape their fate, particularly in the context of the strong bond between a hunter and his dog in Yoruba hunting traditions. It suggests that if someone is determined to make poor choices or ignore good advice, they will do so regardless of warnings or guidance.",
            "Explanation": "The multi-modal cultural context prompting provides rich cultural information that helps the model understand the deeper meaning and cultural significance of the proverb. This results in a more nuanced and culturally informed translation compared to the baseline output."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-modal cultural context prompting method does not significantly improve performance over the baselines, we can explore several alternative directions. First, we could analyze the generated prompts to understand if the extracted visual and audio information is indeed relevant and informative. This could lead to refinements in our feature extraction techniques. Second, we could investigate whether certain types of tasks or languages benefit more from multi-modal context, which might suggest task-specific or language-specific adaptations of our method. Third, we could explore different ways of integrating the multi-modal information, such as using a hierarchical prompt structure or dynamically weighting different modalities based on their relevance to the task. Finally, if the multi-modal approach consistently underperforms, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of why textual representations seem to be sufficient for these tasks, potentially uncovering insights about the nature of cultural knowledge representation in large language models."
