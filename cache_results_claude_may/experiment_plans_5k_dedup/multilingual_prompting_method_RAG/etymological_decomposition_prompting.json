    "idea_name": "Etymological Decomposition Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with understanding and generating words in low-resource languages, especially those with complex morphological structures.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on tokenization or character-level modeling, which may not capture the linguistic structure of morphologically rich languages.",
        "Motivation": "By decomposing words into their etymological and morphological components, we can help the model understand the structure and meaning of unfamiliar words in low-resource languages.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a three-step prompting process: 1) Etymological Analysis: Prompt the model to break down each word in the input into its root and affixes, providing the meaning of each component. 2) Compositional Meaning: Use another prompt to combine the meanings of the components to derive the full word meaning. 3) Contextual Integration: Finally, prompt the model to integrate this detailed word understanding into the broader context of the sentence or passage. This method enables the model to 'understand' unfamiliar words by leveraging its knowledge of linguistic patterns and word formation rules.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on a diverse set of morphologically rich, low-resource languages. Compare against standard multilingual models and morphological analyzers on tasks such as machine translation, text classification, and word sense disambiguation."

        "Title": "Etymological Decomposition Prompting for Improved Multilingual and Low-Resource Language Understanding",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle with understanding and generating words in low-resource languages, especially those with complex morphological structures. This limitation hinders their performance on multilingual tasks and reduces their effectiveness for speakers of less common languages.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically rely on tokenization or character-level modeling, which may not capture the linguistic structure of morphologically rich languages. By decomposing words into their etymological and morphological components, we can help the model understand the structure and meaning of unfamiliar words in low-resource languages. This approach leverages the model's existing knowledge of linguistic patterns and word formation rules, potentially improving its performance without the need for extensive retraining or additional data collection.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a three-step prompting process: 1) Etymological Analysis: Prompt the model to break down each word in the input into its root and affixes, providing the meaning of each component. 2) Compositional Meaning: Use another prompt to combine the meanings of the components to derive the full word meaning. 3) Contextual Integration: Finally, prompt the model to integrate this detailed word understanding into the broader context of the sentence or passage.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that cover a diverse set of morphologically rich, low-resource languages. We will use the TyDiQA dataset for question answering, XNLI for natural language inference, and WikiAnn for named entity recognition. These datasets cover languages such as Swahili, Telugu, and Thai, which have complex morphological structures.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 as our primary models. For comparison, we will also use the open-source XLM-RoBERTa-large model.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Design": "Design prompts for each step of our method. For example:\n1) Etymological Analysis: \"Break down the word '[TARGET_WORD]' into its root and affixes. Provide the meaning of each component.\"\n2) Compositional Meaning: \"Combine the meanings of the components you identified to explain the full meaning of '[TARGET_WORD]'.\"\n3) Contextual Integration: \"Using your understanding of '[TARGET_WORD]', interpret the following sentence: '[SENTENCE]'\"",
            "Step 4: Baseline Experiments": "Run experiments using standard prompting techniques (direct prompting and few-shot prompting) on the selected datasets. Record performance metrics such as F1 score for QA and NER, and accuracy for NLI.",
            "Step 5: Etymological Decomposition Experiments": "Apply our three-step prompting process to the same datasets. For each input, first apply the Etymological Analysis prompt to key words, then the Compositional Meaning prompt, and finally the Contextual Integration prompt.",
            "Step 6: Performance Comparison": "Compare the performance of our method against the baselines. Use paired t-tests to determine if the differences are statistically significant.",
            "Step 7: Error Analysis": "Analyze cases where our method performs better or worse than the baselines. Pay special attention to words with complex morphological structures and how the model interprets them.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies by removing each step of our process (e.g., skipping the Compositional Meaning step) to understand the contribution of each component."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Translate the Swahili word 'ninakupenda' to English.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The Swahili word 'ninakupenda' translates to 'I love you' in English.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Etymological Analysis)": "Break down the Swahili word 'ninakupenda' into its root and affixes. Provide the meaning of each component.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1: Etymological Analysis)": "The word 'ninakupenda' can be broken down as follows:\n- 'ni-': first-person singular subject prefix, meaning 'I'\n- '-na-': present tense marker\n- '-ku-': second-person singular object prefix, meaning 'you'\n- '-penda': verb root meaning 'love'",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Compositional Meaning)": "Combine the meanings of the components you identified to explain the full meaning of 'ninakupenda'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2: Compositional Meaning)": "Combining the components, 'ninakupenda' means 'I (ni-) am currently (-na-) loving (-penda) you (-ku-)'. In natural English, this translates to 'I love you'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Contextual Integration)": "Using your understanding of 'ninakupenda', interpret the following sentence: 'Ninakupenda sana, rafiki yangu.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3: Contextual Integration)": "Given our understanding of 'ninakupenda' as 'I love you', and knowing that 'sana' means 'very much' and 'rafiki yangu' means 'my friend', we can interpret the sentence as: 'I love you very much, my friend.'",
            "Explanation": "The etymological decomposition approach allows the model to understand the structure and meaning of the Swahili word 'ninakupenda' in detail, potentially improving its ability to handle similar complex words in low-resource languages. This method provides a more nuanced understanding compared to the baseline approach, which might rely more heavily on memorized translations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed etymological decomposition method doesn't significantly improve performance, we can explore several alternatives. First, we could analyze whether certain language families or morphological structures benefit more from our approach, potentially leading to a more targeted application. Second, we could investigate combining our method with existing techniques like few-shot learning or chain-of-thought prompting. Third, we could explore using the etymological decomposition as a data augmentation technique, generating new examples by substituting morphologically similar words. Finally, if the performance improvement is minimal across all scenarios, we could pivot the project towards an analysis paper, examining why large language models struggle with morphologically complex languages and proposing theoretical frameworks for addressing these challenges."
