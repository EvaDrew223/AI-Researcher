    "idea_name": "Polysynthetic Language Decomposition Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs perform poorly on polysynthetic languages where single words can express complex meanings typically requiring entire phrases in other languages.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often involve specialized morphological analyzers or subword tokenization techniques.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to break down and reconstruct polysynthetic words, we can improve its understanding and generation capabilities for these complex language structures.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Polysynthetic Language Decomposition Prompting (PLDP): 1) Morpheme Segmentation: Prompt the model to break down words into constituent morphemes. 2) Grammatical Role Identification: Ask the model to identify the grammatical role of each morpheme. 3) Semantic Composition: Prompt for the step-by-step semantic composition of the morphemes. 4) Cross-lingual Paraphrasing: Request paraphrases in analytical languages to verify understanding. 5) Polysynthetic Generation: For generation tasks, prompt the model to construct complex words by combining appropriate morphemes based on the intended meaning.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate PLDP against subword tokenization methods and specialized morphological models on tasks such as machine translation and text summarization for polysynthetic languages, using datasets like the Greenlandic Corpus or Inuktitut parallel texts from Nunavut Hansard."

        "Title": "Polysynthetic Language Decomposition Prompting: Enhancing LLM Performance on Complex Morphological Structures",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with polysynthetic languages, where single words can express complex meanings typically requiring entire phrases in other languages. This limitation hinders the models' ability to effectively process and generate text in these linguistically diverse languages.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches often rely on specialized morphological analyzers or subword tokenization techniques, which may not fully capture the complexity of polysynthetic languages. By prompting the model to break down and reconstruct polysynthetic words, we can potentially improve its understanding and generation capabilities for these complex language structures. This method leverages the LLM's inherent language understanding abilities without requiring extensive retraining or specialized tools.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Polysynthetic Language Decomposition Prompting (PLDP), a multi-step prompting approach: 1) Morpheme Segmentation: Prompt the model to break down words into constituent morphemes. 2) Grammatical Role Identification: Ask the model to identify the grammatical role of each morpheme. 3) Semantic Composition: Prompt for the step-by-step semantic composition of the morphemes. 4) Cross-lingual Paraphrasing: Request paraphrases in analytical languages to verify understanding. 5) Polysynthetic Generation: For generation tasks, prompt the model to construct complex words by combining appropriate morphemes based on the intended meaning.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Data Collection": "Gather datasets for polysynthetic languages, including the Greenlandic Corpus and Inuktitut parallel texts from Nunavut Hansard. Create a test set of 100 sentences for each language, ensuring a diverse range of morphological complexity.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct translation using the LLM without special prompting. 2) Subword tokenization using SentencePiece or BPE, followed by LLM translation.",
            "Step 3: PLDP Implementation": "Develop prompts for each step of PLDP. For example: 1) 'Break down the word [X] into its constituent morphemes.' 2) 'Identify the grammatical role of each morpheme in [X].' 3) 'Explain the step-by-step semantic composition of [X].' 4) 'Provide an English paraphrase for [X].' 5) 'Construct a polysynthetic word meaning [Y] using appropriate morphemes.'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as the primary LLMs for the experiments. Also include an open-source model like BLOOM-176B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each test sentence: 1) Apply baseline methods. 2) Apply PLDP, recording outputs at each step. 3) For generation tasks, provide the English meaning and prompt the model to generate the polysynthetic word.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Use BLEU and chrF++ scores for translation quality. For morphological analysis, use precision, recall, and F1 score comparing to gold standard morphological segmentations. For generation tasks, use human evaluation to assess grammaticality and semantic accuracy.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare PLDP results with baselines. Analyze performance across different morphological complexities. Examine cases where PLDP significantly improves or underperforms compared to baselines."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Translate to English: Parilerpunga",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "I am cooking",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 1: Morpheme Segmentation)": "Break down the Greenlandic word 'Parilerpunga' into its constituent morphemes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 1)": "Pari-ler-punga",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 2: Grammatical Role Identification)": "Identify the grammatical role of each morpheme in 'Pari-ler-punga'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 2)": "Pari-: verb root meaning 'to cook'\n-ler-: aspectual suffix indicating 'beginning' or 'starting'\n-punga: 1st person singular indicative ending",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 3: Semantic Composition)": "Explain the step-by-step semantic composition of 'Pari-ler-punga'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 3)": "1. 'Pari-' provides the core meaning of 'cook'\n2. '-ler-' adds the aspect of 'beginning' to the action\n3. '-punga' indicates that the subject is 'I' and the verb is in the indicative mood\nTogether, these compose to mean 'I am beginning to cook' or 'I am starting to cook'",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Step 4: Cross-lingual Paraphrasing)": "Provide an English paraphrase for 'Parilerpunga'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Step 4)": "I am starting to cook",
            "Explanation": "PLDP allows for a more detailed and accurate understanding of the polysynthetic word structure, leading to a more precise translation compared to the baseline method."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PLDP does not significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why decomposition doesn't improve performance as expected. We could investigate: 1) The accuracy of morpheme segmentation by LLMs compared to specialized tools. 2) Whether errors propagate through the PLDP steps, and at which stages they most commonly occur. 3) The model's ability to handle different types of morphemes (e.g., derivational vs. inflectional) and how this affects overall performance. 4) How the complexity of the polysynthetic word (number of morphemes, rarity of morphemes) correlates with PLDP performance. This analysis could provide valuable insights into LLMs' linguistic capabilities and limitations, potentially informing future approaches to handling morphologically complex languages."
