    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle with languages that have significantly different syntactic structures from the languages they were primarily trained on.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically involve fine-tuning on target language data or using syntax-aware neural architectures.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly aligning syntactic structures between languages, we can help the model transfer its understanding from familiar to unfamiliar language structures.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Syntactic Structure Alignment (SSA), a prompting technique that: (1) Provides a brief explanation of the syntactic structure of the target language, (2) Gives examples of how this structure maps to a more familiar language, (3) Presents the task input with syntactic annotations, (4) Asks the model to solve the task while explicitly reasoning about the syntactic structure. This method encourages the model to consciously consider and adapt to different syntactic patterns.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare SSA with standard prompting and syntax-aware fine-tuning approaches on tasks such as dependency parsing and machine translation, using datasets like Universal Dependencies for diverse language structures."

        "Title": "Syntactic Structure Alignment Prompting for Improved Multilingual and Low-Resource Language Performance in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with languages that have significantly different syntactic structures from the languages they were primarily trained on, particularly for low-resource and vernacular languages. This limitation hinders the models' ability to perform well on multilingual tasks and reduces their effectiveness for diverse language communities.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to addressing this issue typically involve fine-tuning on target language data or using syntax-aware neural architectures. However, these methods can be resource-intensive and may not generalize well across different languages. By explicitly aligning syntactic structures between languages through prompting, we can potentially help the model transfer its understanding from familiar to unfamiliar language structures without the need for extensive retraining or architecture modifications. This approach leverages the model's existing knowledge and encourages it to adapt to different syntactic patterns consciously.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Syntactic Structure Alignment (SSA), a prompting technique that consists of four key components: (1) A brief explanation of the syntactic structure of the target language, (2) Examples of how this structure maps to a more familiar language, (3) Presentation of the task input with syntactic annotations, and (4) A request for the model to solve the task while explicitly reasoning about the syntactic structure. This method aims to guide the model in consciously considering and adapting to different syntactic patterns during inference.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets that cover a range of syntactic structures and language families. We will use the Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks for dependency parsing tasks and the FLORES-101 dataset for machine translation tasks. Select 5-10 languages with varying degrees of syntactic difference from English, including low-resource languages.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Experiments": "Implement and evaluate standard prompting methods as baselines: (a) Zero-shot prompting, (b) Few-shot prompting with examples in the target language, and (c) Chain-of-thought prompting. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for these experiments.",
            "Step 3: SSA Prompt Construction": "For each target language, create SSA prompts following this structure: (1) Provide a concise explanation of key syntactic features of the target language (e.g., word order, case marking). (2) Give 2-3 examples of how these features map to English structures. (3) Present the task input with syntactic annotations (e.g., part-of-speech tags, dependency relations). (4) Instruct the model to solve the task while explicitly considering the syntactic structure.",
            "Step 4: SSA Experiments": "Apply the SSA prompting technique to the same tasks and languages as in Step 2. Use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for consistency.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For dependency parsing, use Labeled Attachment Score (LAS) and Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) as metrics. For machine translation, use BLEU and chrF++ scores. Compare the performance of SSA against the baselines for each language and task.",
            "Step 6: Analysis": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the results, focusing on: (a) Performance improvements across different language families and syntactic structures, (b) The model's ability to generalize syntactic knowledge to unseen structures, and (c) Qualitative assessment of the model's explicit reasoning about syntax in its outputs.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies by removing or modifying components of the SSA prompt (e.g., removing syntactic explanations, varying the number of mapping examples) to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Translate the following sentence from Japanese to English: \u79c1\u306f\u6628\u65e5\u516c\u5712\u3067\u672c\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "I read a book in the park yesterday.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (SSA Prompting)": "Japanese has a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, unlike English's Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. In Japanese, particles mark grammatical functions: \u306f (wa) for topic, \u304c (ga) for subject, \u3092 (wo) for object, \u3067 (de) for location, etc. Example: '\u79c1\u306f\u5b66\u6821\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002' (Watashi wa gakkou ni ikimasu.) translates to 'I go to school.' where 'wa' marks the topic 'I' and 'ni' marks the direction 'to school'. Now, translate the following annotated Japanese sentence to English, explaining your reasoning about the syntactic structure: [\u79c1/PRON-\u306f/TOPIC \u6628\u65e5/NOUN-TIME \u516c\u5712/NOUN-\u3067/LOCATION \u672c/NOUN-\u3092/OBJECT \u8aad\u307f/VERB-\u307e\u3057\u305f/PAST]\u3002",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (SSA Prompting)": "Let's break down the sentence and its structure:\n1. [\u79c1/PRON-\u306f/TOPIC]: 'I' is the topic of the sentence.\n2. [\u6628\u65e5/NOUN-TIME]: 'yesterday' is the time when the action occurred.\n3. [\u516c\u5712/NOUN-\u3067/LOCATION]: 'in the park' is where the action took place. The particle '\u3067' marks the location.\n4. [\u672c/NOUN-\u3092/OBJECT]: 'book' is the object of the action. The particle '\u3092' marks it as the direct object.\n5. [\u8aad\u307f/VERB-\u307e\u3057\u305f/PAST]: 'read' is the main verb, and '\u307e\u3057\u305f' indicates past tense.\n\nRearranging this into English SVO order and adding appropriate English grammar:\n\nTranslation: 'I read a book in the park yesterday.'\n\nThis translation maintains the meaning while adapting to English syntax, moving the verb 'read' after the subject 'I' and before the object 'a book', and placing time and location information at the end of the sentence as is common in English.",
            "explanation": "The SSA prompt provides explicit information about Japanese syntax and guides the model to consider syntactic structure during translation. This results in a more detailed and accurate translation process compared to direct prompting."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the SSA method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify specific syntactic structures or language features that the model struggles with, even when using SSA. This could lead to insights about the limitations of current LLMs in handling cross-lingual syntactic differences. 2) Experiment with combining SSA with other prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought or few-shot learning, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 3) Investigate whether SSA is more effective for certain types of NLP tasks (e.g., parsing vs. translation) and focus on understanding why it works better for some tasks than others. 4) Explore how SSA performance varies with model size and architecture, which could provide insights into the relationship between model capacity and ability to leverage explicit syntactic information. 5) Develop a quantitative measure for 'syntactic distance' between languages and analyze how this correlates with the effectiveness of SSA, potentially leading to a predictive framework for when SSA is likely to be most beneficial."
