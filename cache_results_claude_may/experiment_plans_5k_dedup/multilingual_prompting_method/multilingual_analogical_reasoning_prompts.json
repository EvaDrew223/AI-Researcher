    "idea_name": "Multilingual Analogical Reasoning Prompts",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle with transferring reasoning capabilities across languages, especially for complex tasks that require analogical thinking.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on translating reasoning tasks or fine-tuning models on multilingual data, which may not effectively capture the nuances of analogical reasoning across cultures.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to draw analogies between concepts in different languages and cultures, we can enhance their ability to reason across linguistic boundaries.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multilingual Analogical Reasoning Prompts (MARP), a technique that constructs prompts to guide the model in drawing cross-lingual and cross-cultural analogies. The prompt structure includes: 1) A concept explanation in language A, 2) An analogous concept in culture B, 3) A reasoning task in language A, and 4) Instructions to solve an equivalent task in language B using the provided analogy. For example: 'In English, we have the concept of 'time is money'. In Japanese culture, a similar concept is 'itadakimasu' (gratitude before meals). Given the problem [TASK_A] in English, solve the equivalent problem [TASK_B] in Japanese, using the cultural analogy provided.' This method encourages the model to transfer reasoning skills across languages while considering cultural contexts.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MARP on a range of reasoning tasks (e.g., ethical dilemmas, proverb interpretation, problem-solving) across multiple language pairs. Compare performance against baseline methods of direct translation and monolingual reasoning. Assess the quality and cultural appropriateness of the generated solutions."

        "Title": "Enhancing Multilingual Reasoning in Large Language Models through Cross-Cultural Analogical Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with transferring reasoning capabilities across languages, especially for complex tasks that require analogical thinking. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in multilingual and cross-cultural applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on translating reasoning tasks or fine-tuning models on multilingual data, which may not effectively capture the nuances of analogical reasoning across cultures. By prompting LLMs to draw analogies between concepts in different languages and cultures, we can enhance their ability to reason across linguistic boundaries. This method leverages the model's existing knowledge to bridge cultural and linguistic gaps, potentially improving performance on multilingual tasks without the need for extensive fine-tuning or data collection.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multilingual Analogical Reasoning Prompts (MARP), a technique that constructs prompts to guide the model in drawing cross-lingual and cross-cultural analogies. The prompt structure includes: 1) A concept explanation in language A, 2) An analogous concept in culture B, 3) A reasoning task in language A, and 4) Instructions to solve an equivalent task in language B using the provided analogy. For example: 'In English, we have the concept of \"time is money\". In Japanese culture, a similar concept is \"itadakimasu\" (gratitude before meals). Given the problem [TASK_A] in English, solve the equivalent problem [TASK_B] in Japanese, using the cultural analogy provided.' This method encourages the model to transfer reasoning skills across languages while considering cultural contexts.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Curate a dataset of reasoning tasks across multiple language pairs. Include tasks from various domains such as ethical dilemmas, proverb interpretation, and problem-solving. Ensure each task has versions in at least two languages. Use existing multilingual datasets like XNLI, PAWS-X, and XQuAD as starting points, and extend them with custom-created analogical reasoning tasks.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Direct translation: Translate the task to the target language and prompt the model to solve it. 2) Monolingual reasoning: Present the task in the original language and prompt the model to solve it, then translate the solution.",
            "Step 3: MARP Implementation": "Develop a prompt template for MARP that includes the four components mentioned in the proposed method. Create a bank of cross-cultural analogies for common concepts that appear in the reasoning tasks. Implement a function to dynamically construct MARP prompts by selecting appropriate analogies based on the task content and target language.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API as the primary models for evaluation. Additionally, include open-source multilingual models like XLM-RoBERTa-large and mT5-large for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each task in the dataset: a) Apply the baseline methods and record the results. b) Generate a MARP prompt and use it to obtain a solution. c) Store all inputs, prompts, and model outputs for later analysis.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Develop an evaluation framework that assesses: 1) Accuracy of the solutions. 2) Relevance of the generated analogies. 3) Cultural appropriateness of the responses. Use a combination of automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE for text similarity) and manual evaluation by multilingual experts.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of MARP against the baselines across different language pairs and task types. Analyze how the complexity of the analogy affects the model's performance. Investigate cases where MARP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MARP method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why MARP fails, focusing on the types of tasks or language pairs where it underperforms. This could lead to insights about the limitations of cross-cultural analogies in language models. 2) Experiment with different structures for the MARP prompts, such as including multiple analogies or adding explicit instructions for cultural sensitivity. 3) Investigate the model's ability to generate its own cross-cultural analogies, which could turn the project into a study of LLMs' cross-cultural knowledge and creativity. 4) Expand the scope to include a broader range of languages and cultures, potentially uncovering patterns in how well the method works for linguistically similar versus distant language pairs. 5) Combine MARP with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or self-consistency to see if a hybrid approach yields better results."
