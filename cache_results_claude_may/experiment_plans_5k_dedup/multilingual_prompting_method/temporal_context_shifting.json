    "idea_name": "Temporal Context Shifting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with understanding and generating text in historical or evolving versions of languages, particularly for low-resource languages with limited diachronic data.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on contemporary language use or rely on limited historical corpora for fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "Languages evolve over time, and understanding this evolution can provide valuable context for processing both historical and contemporary texts. This is particularly important for low-resource languages where modern standardization may be limited.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Context Shifting (TCS), a prompting method that dynamically adjusts the temporal context of the input. TCS uses a sliding window approach to generate multiple temporally-shifted versions of the input text, spanning from historical to contemporary forms. For example, given a modern English input, TCS might generate prompts in Early Modern English, Middle English, and Old English. The model is then asked to process all temporal variants and synthesize a response that accounts for linguistic evolution. This method encourages the model to consider diachronic language changes, improving its ability to handle both historical texts and modern variations in low-resource languages.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TCS on tasks such as historical text comprehension, diachronic translation, and temporally-aware text generation. Compare performance against standard prompting and fine-tuning approaches on datasets spanning multiple time periods for several low-resource languages. Assess the model's ability to handle linguistic anachronisms and temporal code-switching."

        "Title": "Temporal Context Shifting: Improving Large Language Models' Performance on Diachronic Language Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle with understanding and generating text in historical or evolving versions of languages, particularly for low-resource languages with limited diachronic data. This limitation hinders their ability to process both historical texts and contemporary variations in low-resource languages.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on contemporary language use or rely on limited historical corpora for fine-tuning. However, languages evolve over time, and understanding this evolution can provide valuable context for processing both historical and contemporary texts. This is particularly important for low-resource languages where modern standardization may be limited. By developing a method that dynamically adjusts the temporal context of the input, we can potentially improve the model's ability to handle linguistic variations across different time periods and enhance its performance on diachronic language tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Context Shifting (TCS), a prompting method that dynamically adjusts the temporal context of the input. TCS uses a sliding window approach to generate multiple temporally-shifted versions of the input text, spanning from historical to contemporary forms. For each input, TCS generates prompts in different historical language variants (e.g., Early Modern English, Middle English, and Old English for an English input). The model is then asked to process all temporal variants and synthesize a response that accounts for linguistic evolution. This method encourages the model to consider diachronic language changes, potentially improving its ability to handle both historical texts and modern variations in low-resource languages.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Collect datasets that span multiple time periods for several low-resource languages. We will use the following datasets: 1) Historical English datasets: CEAD (Corpus of Early American English Dialogues) and ARCHER (A Representative Corpus of Historical English Registers). 2) Low-resource language datasets: NCHLT (National Centre for Human Language Technology) Text Corpus for African languages and the Universal Dependencies treebanks for historical variants of low-resource languages.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 as our primary models, accessed through the OpenAI API. We will also include the open-source LLaMA-2-70B-chat model for comparison.",
            "Step 3: Implement TCS Prompting": "Develop a function that takes an input text and generates temporally-shifted variants. For English, generate variants in Modern English, Early Modern English, Middle English, and Old English. For low-resource languages, generate variants based on available historical data. Example prompt structure: 'Given the following text in [current language variant]: [input text]. Generate versions of this text in [historical variant 1], [historical variant 2], and [historical variant 3]. Then, provide a comprehensive answer that takes into account all language variants.'",
            "Step 4: Baseline Experiments": "Implement and run experiments using standard prompting and fine-tuning approaches: 1) Zero-shot prompting: directly input the question without any context. 2) Few-shot prompting: include 2-3 examples of similar questions and answers in the prompt. 3) Fine-tuning: fine-tune the LLaMA-2-70B-chat model on a small subset of the historical data.",
            "Step 5: TCS Experiments": "Run experiments using the TCS prompting method on the same datasets and tasks as the baselines. For each input, generate temporally-shifted variants, prompt the model with all variants, and collect the synthesized response.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of both baseline methods and TCS on the following tasks: 1) Historical text comprehension: measure accuracy on multiple-choice questions about historical texts. 2) Diachronic translation: assess the quality of translations between historical and contemporary language variants using BLEU and chrF scores. 3) Temporally-aware text generation: evaluate the coherence and historical accuracy of generated text set in different time periods using perplexity and human evaluation.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of TCS against the baselines. Analyze the model's ability to handle linguistic anachronisms and temporal code-switching. Examine how the performance varies across different historical periods and low-resource languages."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Translate the following Early Modern English text to Modern English: 'Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "You are more beautiful and more gentle: Strong winds shake the beloved buds of May.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (TCS Prompting)": "Given the following text in Early Modern English: 'Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.' Generate versions of this text in Modern English, Middle English, and Old English. Then, provide a comprehensive translation to Modern English that takes into account all language variants.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (TCS Prompting)": "Modern English: 'You are more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.'\nMiddle English: 'Thou art more lufly and more temperat: Roughe windes doon shake the derling buddes of May.'\nOld English: '\u00de\u016b eart l\u016bfl\u012bcra and \u0121em\u0113tl\u012bcra: Hr\u0113ohe windas sceaca\u00fe \u00fe\u0101 d\u0113orlinga bl\u014dstman of Maius.'\n\nComprehensive Modern English translation: You are more beautiful and more moderate in temperament. Strong, harsh winds shake the delicate, beloved flower buds that appear in the month of May.",
            "Explanation": "The TCS method provides a more nuanced and historically informed translation by considering multiple temporal variants of the text. It captures subtle meanings and connotations that might be lost in a direct translation from a single historical variant."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the TCS method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why TCS fails, examining specific linguistic features or time periods that prove challenging. 2) Explore combining TCS with other prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought or few-shot learning, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. 3) Investigate whether TCS improves performance on specific subtasks or linguistic phenomena, even if overall performance is not significantly better. This could lead to insights about the model's handling of diachronic language features. 4) Expand the analysis to include more diverse low-resource languages or longer time spans, which might reveal strengths of TCS not apparent in the initial experiments. 5) Develop a new method that addresses the shortcomings identified in TCS, possibly incorporating elements of diachronic linguistics or historical language models."
