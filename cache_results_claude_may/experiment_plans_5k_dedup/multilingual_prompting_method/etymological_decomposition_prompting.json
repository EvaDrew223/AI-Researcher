        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle with understanding and generating rare or complex words in low-resource languages.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on expanding vocabulary or fine-tuning on domain-specific data.",
        "Motivation": "By breaking down complex words into their etymological components, we can leverage the model's understanding of more common roots and affixes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Etymological Decomposition Prompting (EDP), which involves: (1) Identifying complex or rare words in the input, (2) Prompting the model to break down these words into their etymological components, (3) Providing brief explanations of these components, (4) Asking the model to solve the task using this decomposed and explained version. This method enables the model to understand and generate complex words by relating them to more familiar linguistic elements.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Compare EDP with standard prompting and vocabulary expansion techniques on tasks such as machine translation and text summarization for languages with complex morphology, using datasets like FLORES-101."

        "Title": "Etymological Decomposition Prompting: Enhancing LLM Performance on Low-Resource Languages through Word Component Analysis",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with understanding and generating rare or complex words in low-resource languages, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual tasks and applications involving vernacular languages.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improve LLM performance on low-resource languages typically rely on expanding vocabulary or fine-tuning on domain-specific data. However, these methods can be resource-intensive and may not generalize well across different languages. By leveraging the model's understanding of more common roots and affixes, we can potentially enhance its ability to process complex words in low-resource languages without extensive retraining or data collection.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Etymological Decomposition Prompting (EDP), a novel prompting technique that involves: (1) Identifying complex or rare words in the input, (2) Prompting the model to break down these words into their etymological components, (3) Providing brief explanations of these components, and (4) Asking the model to solve the task using this decomposed and explained version. This method enables the model to understand and generate complex words by relating them to more familiar linguistic elements.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the FLORES-101 dataset, which covers 101 languages, including many low-resource ones. We'll focus on the machine translation task, selecting 10 low-resource languages for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Selection": "We'll use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 as our primary models, accessed through the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Prompts": "We'll create two baseline prompts: (1) Direct translation prompt: 'Translate the following sentence from [source language] to English: [input sentence]' (2) Few-shot prompt: Include 3 examples of translations before the target sentence.",
            "Step 4: EDP Implementation": "For each input sentence: a) Identify complex words using a frequency threshold based on a pre-compiled word list for each language. b) For each complex word, prompt the model to decompose it: 'Break down the word [complex word] into its etymological components and provide a brief explanation for each component.' c) Construct the EDP prompt by incorporating the decompositions: 'Translate the following sentence from [source language] to English. Here are explanations for some complex words: [insert decompositions]. Sentence: [input sentence]'",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "For each of the 10 selected languages: a) Randomly select 100 sentences from the FLORES-101 test set. b) Apply the baseline prompts and the EDP prompt to each sentence. c) Generate translations using both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "a) Use BLEU and chrF++ scores to evaluate the quality of translations. b) Conduct a manual evaluation on a subset of 20 sentences per language, focusing on the accuracy of complex word translations. c) Compare the performance of EDP against the baselines for each language and model.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "a) Calculate the average improvement in BLEU and chrF++ scores across all languages. b) Analyze the correlation between language complexity (measured by average word length or morphological complexity) and the effectiveness of EDP. c) Examine cases where EDP significantly outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Translation)": "Translate the following sentence from Yoruba to English: '\u00c0w\u1ecdn \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 n\u00e1\u00e0 \u0144 s\u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 n\u00edpa \u00ecd\u00e0gb\u00e0s\u00f3k\u00e8 \u00e0ti \u00ecd\u00e0gb\u00e0s\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300 or\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300-\u00e8d\u00e8 w\u1ecdn.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Translation)": "The children are talking about the development and progress of their country.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (EDP)": "Translate the following sentence from Yoruba to English. Here are explanations for some complex words: '\u00ecd\u00e0gb\u00e0s\u00f3k\u00e8' - from '\u00ec' (nominalization prefix) + 'd\u00e0gb\u00e0' (to grow) + 's\u00ed' (towards) + '\u00f2k\u00e8' (up), meaning 'development or growth upwards'; '\u00ecd\u00e0gb\u00e0s\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300' - from '\u00ec' (nominalization prefix) + 'd\u00e0gb\u00e0' (to grow) + 's\u00ed' (towards) + 'il\u1eb9\u0300' (ground), meaning 'development or growth downwards'. Sentence: '\u00c0w\u1ecdn \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 n\u00e1\u00e0 \u0144 s\u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 n\u00edpa \u00ecd\u00e0gb\u00e0s\u00f3k\u00e8 \u00e0ti \u00ecd\u00e0gb\u00e0s\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300 or\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300-\u00e8d\u00e8 w\u1ecdn.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (EDP)": "The children are discussing the progress and decline (literally: upward development and downward development) of their country.",
            "Explanation": "The EDP method provides a more nuanced translation by explaining the etymological components of complex words, allowing for a more accurate interpretation of '\u00ecd\u00e0gb\u00e0s\u00f3k\u00e8' and '\u00ecd\u00e0gb\u00e0s\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300' as contrasting concepts of progress and decline."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If EDP does not significantly improve translation quality, we can pivot our research focus to analyze why the method falls short. We could examine whether the etymological decompositions are accurate and relevant, or if they introduce noise that confuses the model. We might also investigate whether certain language families or linguistic features benefit more from EDP than others. Additionally, we could explore combining EDP with other prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought or few-shot learning, to see if a hybrid approach yields better results. Finally, we could conduct an error analysis to identify specific types of words or linguistic structures where EDP is most effective, potentially leading to a more targeted application of the technique."
