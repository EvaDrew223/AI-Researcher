    "idea_name": "Phonetic Similarity Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with low-resource languages and dialects due to limited training data and unfamiliarity with phonetic structures.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on transfer learning from high-resource languages or limited fine-tuning on available data.",
        "Motivation": "Many low-resource languages share phonetic similarities with more widely spoken languages. Leveraging these similarities could help models better understand and generate text in unfamiliar languages.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Phonetic Similarity Prompting (PSP), which augments prompts with phonetically similar words from related high-resource languages. For each word in the low-resource language input, we identify phonetically similar words in related high-resource languages using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). We then construct a prompt that includes both the original text and its phonetic parallels, encouraging the model to draw connections between known and unknown linguistic patterns. For example, a Scots prompt might be augmented with phonetically similar English words: 'Hou are ye daein the day? (How are you doing today?)'. This method allows the model to leverage its knowledge of high-resource languages to better process and generate text in low-resource languages.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate PSP against standard few-shot prompting on translation and text generation tasks for various low-resource languages. Use BLEU scores for translation and human evaluation for text generation quality. Compare performance across languages with varying degrees of phonetic similarity to high-resource languages."

        "Title": "Phonetic Similarity Prompting: Improving Large Language Models' Performance on Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle with low-resource languages and dialects due to limited training data and unfamiliarity with phonetic structures. This research aims to address this challenge by leveraging phonetic similarities between low-resource and high-resource languages to enhance model performance.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to handling low-resource languages typically rely on transfer learning from high-resource languages or limited fine-tuning on available data. However, these methods often fail to capture the unique phonetic structures of low-resource languages. Many low-resource languages share phonetic similarities with more widely spoken languages. By leveraging these similarities, we can potentially help models better understand and generate text in unfamiliar languages without the need for extensive additional training data or fine-tuning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Phonetic Similarity Prompting (PSP), which augments prompts with phonetically similar words from related high-resource languages. The method works as follows: 1) For each word in the low-resource language input, identify phonetically similar words in related high-resource languages using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). 2) Construct a prompt that includes both the original text and its phonetic parallels. 3) Use this augmented prompt to encourage the model to draw connections between known and unknown linguistic patterns. For example, a Scots prompt might be augmented with phonetically similar English words: 'Hou are ye daein the day? (How are you doing today?)'.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Data Preparation": "Select low-resource languages for evaluation. We will use Scots, Frisian, and Sardinian as our target low-resource languages, with English, Dutch, and Italian as their respective high-resource counterparts. Collect or create datasets for translation and text generation tasks in these languages.",
            "Step 2: IPA Mapping": "Create a mapping between the orthography of each language pair and their IPA representations. Use existing IPA dictionaries or text-to-IPA conversion tools for this step.",
            "Step 3: Phonetic Similarity Function": "Implement a function to calculate phonetic similarity between words based on their IPA representations. Use a measure like Levenshtein distance on IPA symbols.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Construction": "For each input in the low-resource language, create three types of prompts: a) Baseline prompt (original text only), b) Few-shot prompt (with examples in the low-resource language), and c) PSP prompt (original text augmented with phonetically similar words from the high-resource language).",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 6: Task Execution": "Run translation and text generation tasks using each prompt type. For translation, use the prompt: 'Translate the following [low-resource language] text to English: [input text]'. For text generation, use: 'Continue the following [low-resource language] text: [input text]'.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "For translation tasks, use BLEU scores to evaluate performance. For text generation, use perplexity and human evaluation (fluency and coherence on a 1-5 scale). Compare results across different prompting methods and language pairs.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze performance differences across languages with varying degrees of phonetic similarity to their high-resource counterparts. Investigate cases where PSP performs particularly well or poorly."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Translate the following Scots text to English: 'Hou are ye daein the day?'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "How are you doing today?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Translate the following Scots text to English. The text is followed by phonetically similar English words in parentheses: 'Hou (How) are ye (you) daein (doing) the day (today)?'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "How are you doing today?",
            "Explanation": "The PSP method provides phonetic cues from English, a high-resource language, which can help the model better understand and translate the Scots input."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PSP doesn't significantly improve performance, we can explore several alternatives: 1) Analyze the generated phonetic similarities to ensure they're accurate and helpful. If not, refine the phonetic similarity function or explore other phonetic representation systems. 2) Investigate whether certain types of words or linguistic structures benefit more from PSP. This could lead to a hybrid approach where PSP is applied selectively. 3) Experiment with different ways of incorporating the phonetic information, such as interleaving it with the original text or presenting it as a separate context. 4) If PSP shows promise but needs refinement, we could explore combining it with other techniques like few-shot learning or chain-of-thought prompting. 5) If PSP doesn't work well for translation or generation tasks, we could pivot to using it for other tasks like language identification or dialect classification where phonetic similarities might be more directly useful."
