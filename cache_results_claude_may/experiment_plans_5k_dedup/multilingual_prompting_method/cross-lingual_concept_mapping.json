    "idea_name": "Cross-Lingual Concept Mapping",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models struggle with translating and understanding domain-specific concepts across languages, especially for low-resource languages.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on parallel corpora or machine translation systems, which may not capture nuanced meanings of specialized terms.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging the LLM's understanding of concepts in a high-resource language and guiding it to find equivalent expressions in low-resource languages, we can improve cross-lingual transfer of domain knowledge.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cross-Lingual Concept Mapping (CLCM), a prompting technique that uses a two-stage approach. First, we prompt the LLM to explain a concept in detail in a high-resource language (e.g., English). Then, we use this explanation to guide the model in finding or constructing equivalent expressions in the target low-resource language. The prompt includes instructions like 'Given the following explanation of [CONCEPT] in English, provide an equivalent expression or explanation in [TARGET_LANGUAGE], using culturally relevant examples if possible.' This method allows the model to transfer its deep understanding of concepts across languages, rather than relying on direct translation.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CLCM against baseline translation methods on domain-specific tasks such as medical terminology translation or technical documentation localization across various language pairs, including low-resource languages. Measure accuracy, fluency, and cultural relevance of the generated expressions."

        "Title": "Cross-Lingual Concept Mapping: Improving Domain-Specific Translation for Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) struggle with translating and understanding domain-specific concepts across languages, especially for low-resource languages. This challenge is particularly acute when dealing with specialized terminology in fields such as medicine, technology, or law, where direct translation often fails to capture the nuanced meanings and cultural contexts of these concepts.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to cross-lingual transfer often rely on parallel corpora or machine translation systems, which may not adequately capture the nuanced meanings of specialized terms, especially for low-resource languages. By leveraging the LLM's understanding of concepts in a high-resource language and guiding it to find equivalent expressions in low-resource languages, we can potentially improve the cross-lingual transfer of domain knowledge. This method allows for a more context-aware and culturally sensitive translation of complex concepts, which is crucial for effective communication in specialized fields across different languages and cultures.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Cross-Lingual Concept Mapping (CLCM), a prompting technique that uses a two-stage approach. First, we prompt the LLM to explain a concept in detail in a high-resource language (e.g., English). Then, we use this explanation to guide the model in finding or constructing equivalent expressions in the target low-resource language. The prompt includes instructions like 'Given the following explanation of [CONCEPT] in English, provide an equivalent expression or explanation in [TARGET_LANGUAGE], using culturally relevant examples if possible.' This method allows the model to transfer its deep understanding of concepts across languages, rather than relying on direct translation.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Create a dataset of domain-specific concepts in English from fields such as medicine, technology, and law. For each concept, include a detailed explanation in English. Pair these with their translations in several low-resource languages. Use existing parallel corpora or collaborate with domain experts and native speakers for manual translation. Target languages could include Swahili, Nepali, and Quechua.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Direct translation using existing machine translation APIs (e.g., Google Translate), (2) Few-shot prompting of LLMs with examples of translations without detailed explanations.",
            "Step 3: CLCM Implementation": "Implement the CLCM method using the following steps: a) Prompt the LLM to generate a detailed explanation of the concept in English. b) Use this explanation in a second prompt to generate an equivalent expression in the target language.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI's API for all experiments. Also include an open-source model like BLOOM-176B for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Use the following metrics: a) BLEU score for similarity to reference translations, b) Expert evaluation for accuracy and cultural relevance (on a subset of data), c) Fluency evaluation using perplexity scores from language-specific models.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each concept in the dataset: a) Generate translations using both baseline methods and CLCM. b) Calculate BLEU scores for all methods. c) For a subset, conduct expert evaluations. d) Measure fluency using language-specific models.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of CLCM against baselines across different domains and target languages. Analyze where CLCM performs better or worse, and identify patterns in the types of concepts that benefit most from this approach."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Translation)": "Translate the following medical term to Swahili: Myocardial infarction",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Translation)": "Kiharusi cha moyo",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Few-shot Translation)": "Translate the following medical terms to Swahili:\n1. Hypertension - Shinikizo la damu\n2. Diabetes - Kisukari\n3. Myocardial infarction - ",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Few-shot Translation)": "Myocardial infarction - Kiharusi cha moyo",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLCM; Step 1: Concept Explanation)": "Explain the medical concept of 'myocardial infarction' in detail, including its causes, symptoms, and significance.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLCM; Step 1: Concept Explanation)": "Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a serious medical condition where blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium) is blocked, causing damage or death of heart tissue. It occurs when one or more of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, become obstructed, usually due to the buildup of plaque (atherosclerosis). This blockage prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a part of the heart, leading to the death of heart muscle cells. Symptoms typically include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, lightheadedness, and cold sweats. It's a medical emergency requiring immediate attention as it can lead to severe complications or death if not treated promptly. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and diabetes.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLCM; Step 2: Swahili Translation)": "Given the following explanation of 'myocardial infarction' in English, provide an equivalent expression or explanation in Swahili, using culturally relevant examples if possible: [Insert the explanation from Step 1]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLCM; Step 2: Swahili Translation)": "'Shambulio la moyo' au 'kiharusi cha moyo' ni hali hatari ya kimatibabu ambapo mtiririko wa damu kwenye misuli ya moyo unazuiwa, kusababisha uharibifu au kifo cha tishu za moyo. Hii hutokea wakati mojawapo ya mishipa ya damu inayopeleka damu kwenye moyo inazibwa, kawaida kutokana na kujikusanya kwa mafuta (atherosclerosis). Kizuizi hiki kinazuia damu yenye oksijeni kufika sehemu ya moyo, na kusababisha kifo cha seli za misuli ya moyo. Dalili kawaida ni pamoja na maumivu ya kifua, kupumua kwa shida, kichefuchefu, kizunguzungu, na jasho la baridi. Ni dharura ya kimatibabu inayohitaji kushughulikiwa mara moja kwani inaweza kusababisha madhara makubwa au kifo ikiwa haitatibiwa haraka. Mambo yanayoongeza hatari ni pamoja na shinikizo la damu, kolesterol ya juu, uvutaji sigara, unene, na kisukari. Katika jamii nyingi za Kiafrika, hali hii inaweza kuelezewa kama 'moyo kuzimia ghafla' au 'moyo kushambuliwa', na mara nyingi inahusishwa na mfadhaiko mkubwa au 'presha' ya maisha ya kisasa.",
            "explanation": "The CLCM method provides a more comprehensive and culturally relevant translation. It not only gives the Swahili term 'shambulio la moyo' or 'kiharusi cha moyo', but also explains the concept in detail, using terms and examples that are more relatable to the target culture. This approach is likely to be more effective in conveying the full meaning and implications of the medical concept compared to the direct or few-shot translation methods."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CLCM method does not show significant improvement over baselines, we can pivot the project in several ways: 1) Conduct an in-depth analysis of where and why CLCM fails, which could provide insights into the limitations of current LLMs in cross-lingual understanding. 2) Experiment with a hybrid approach that combines CLCM with traditional machine translation methods, potentially leveraging the strengths of both. 3) Investigate the impact of different prompting strategies within the CLCM framework, such as varying the level of detail in the initial explanation or incorporating more cultural context in the prompts. 4) Expand the study to compare CLCM's performance across different domains and language pairs, which could reveal patterns in its effectiveness and inform future research directions in cross-lingual NLP."
