    "idea_name": "Cultural Context Injection",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often lack cultural context for low-resource languages, leading to misunderstandings or inappropriate generations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically involve fine-tuning on culturally-specific data or using cultural adaptation layers.",
        "Motivation": "By injecting relevant cultural context into prompts, we can improve the model's understanding and generation capabilities for culturally-specific content.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Cultural Context Injection (CCI), a prompting technique that: (1) Identifies culturally-specific elements in the input, (2) Prompts the model to provide relevant cultural background information, (3) Incorporates this information into an expanded prompt that frames the task within its cultural context, (4) Asks the model to solve the task while explicitly considering the cultural nuances. This method enables the model to generate more culturally appropriate and contextually accurate outputs.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCI against standard prompting and cultural adaptation methods on tasks like dialogue generation and text style transfer for diverse cultures, using datasets such as XCOPA and custom-curated culturally-rich corpora."

        "Title": "Cultural Context Injection: Enhancing LLMs' Performance on Multilingual and Low-Resource Language Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack cultural context for low-resource languages, leading to misunderstandings or inappropriate generations. This problem is particularly acute in tasks requiring cultural nuance, such as dialogue generation or text style transfer.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically involve fine-tuning on culturally-specific data or using cultural adaptation layers, which can be resource-intensive and may not generalize well across diverse cultures. By injecting relevant cultural context into prompts, we can potentially improve the model's understanding and generation capabilities for culturally-specific content without the need for extensive fine-tuning or additional model parameters.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Cultural Context Injection (CCI), a prompting technique that consists of four steps: (1) Identify culturally-specific elements in the input, (2) Prompt the model to provide relevant cultural background information, (3) Incorporate this information into an expanded prompt that frames the task within its cultural context, (4) Ask the model to solve the task while explicitly considering the cultural nuances. This method enables the model to generate more culturally appropriate and contextually accurate outputs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the XCOPA dataset for cross-lingual commonsense reasoning and create a custom dataset for culturally-rich dialogue generation. For XCOPA, we'll focus on low-resource languages like Quechua, Hausa, and Tamil. For dialogue generation, we'll curate conversations from social media platforms in these languages, ensuring diverse cultural contexts.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement three baseline methods: (1) Direct prompting without cultural context, (2) Few-shot prompting with examples from the target culture, and (3) Chain-of-thought prompting.",
            "Step 3: Implement CCI": "Develop prompts for each step of the CCI method. For step 1, create a prompt to identify cultural elements. For step 2, prompt the model to provide cultural background. For step 3, design a template to incorporate cultural context. For step 4, create a prompt that explicitly asks the model to consider cultural nuances.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI's API for our experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "For XCOPA, use the standard accuracy metric. For dialogue generation, use automated metrics like BLEU and BERTScore, as well as human evaluation for cultural appropriateness and contextual accuracy.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "Run experiments for each task and language, comparing CCI against the baselines. Use a sample size of 1000 examples per language for XCOPA and 500 dialogues per language for the custom dataset.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare performance across methods, languages, and tasks. Conduct error analysis to identify patterns in where CCI succeeds or fails compared to baselines."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Generate a dialogue between two friends discussing a wedding in Tamil culture.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Friend 1: Hey, are you going to Priya's wedding next week?\nFriend 2: Yes, I am! I'm excited to see the ceremony.\nFriend 1: Me too. I heard it's going to be a big event.\nFriend 2: Yeah, Indian weddings are usually quite elaborate.\nFriend 1: Should we bring a gift?\nFriend 2: I think so. Maybe we can go shopping together for something nice.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCI; Step 1: Identify Cultural Elements)": "Identify the key cultural elements that need to be considered when discussing a wedding in Tamil culture.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCI; Step 1: Identify Cultural Elements)": "1. Traditional Tamil wedding rituals (e.g., Oonjal, Kanya Dhanam)\n2. Importance of astrology in choosing the wedding date\n3. Specific Tamil wedding attire (e.g., Madisar for the bride)\n4. Traditional Tamil wedding food\n5. The concept of Thali (Mangalsutra in Tamil culture)\n6. Multi-day celebration structure\n7. Role of family elders in the ceremony",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCI; Step 2: Cultural Background)": "Provide brief background information on the identified cultural elements of Tamil weddings.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCI; Step 2: Cultural Background)": "Tamil weddings are deeply rooted in tradition and typically last for several days. The Oonjal ceremony involves the couple being seated on a swing, symbolizing balance in marriage. Kanya Dhanam is the ritual of giving away the bride. Astrology plays a crucial role, with the wedding date (muhurtham) chosen based on the couple's horoscopes. The bride typically wears a Madisar, a nine-yard saree draped in a specific style. The wedding feast, called Virundhu, features traditional Tamil dishes served on a banana leaf. The Thali, equivalent to the Mangalsutra, is a sacred necklace tied by the groom. Family elders play significant roles in conducting various rituals throughout the ceremony.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CCI; Step 3: Incorporate Context)": "Generate a dialogue between two friends discussing a wedding in Tamil culture, incorporating the cultural background information provided.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CCI; Step 3: Incorporate Context)": "Friend 1: Hey, are you ready for Priya's wedding next week? I heard the muhurtham was chosen after careful astrological calculations.\nFriend 2: Yes, I am! I'm excited to see all the traditional rituals, especially the Oonjal ceremony.\nFriend 1: Me too. I wonder if Priya will wear a Madisar for the main ceremony.\nFriend 2: Most likely! And I can't wait for the Virundhu. Tamil wedding feasts are amazing.\nFriend 1: Absolutely! Oh, should we bring a gift for the Thali ceremony?\nFriend 2: That's thoughtful, but usually, the Thali is a family heirloom or chosen by the couple's families.\nFriend 1: Right, thanks for reminding me. It's fascinating how every ritual has such deep cultural significance.\nFriend 2: Definitely. Tamil weddings are a beautiful blend of tradition and celebration.",
            "explanation": "The CCI method produces a more culturally informed and nuanced dialogue compared to the baseline. It incorporates specific Tamil wedding traditions, appropriate terminology, and cultural practices, resulting in a more authentic representation of a conversation about a Tamil wedding."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CCI method doesn't significantly outperform baselines, we can pivot to an analysis paper exploring why cultural context injection might be challenging for LLMs. We could investigate whether the model struggles more with certain types of cultural information or specific languages. We might also examine if the model's performance varies based on the cultural distance between its training data and the target culture. Additionally, we could explore alternative ways of incorporating cultural context, such as iterative refinement where the model gradually builds up cultural knowledge through multiple rounds of prompting. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling diverse cultural contexts and suggest directions for future improvements in cross-cultural NLP tasks."
