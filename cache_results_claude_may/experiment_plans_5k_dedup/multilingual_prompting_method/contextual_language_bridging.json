    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs struggle with low-resource languages due to limited training data and contextual understanding.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on translation or multilingual pretraining.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging contextual similarities between languages, we can bridge the gap between high-resource and low-resource languages.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contextual Language Bridging (CLB), a novel prompting technique that utilizes contextual cues from related high-resource languages to enhance performance in low-resource languages. The prompt structure includes: (1) A brief description of the task in the high-resource language, (2) Examples of similar contexts in both languages, (3) The actual task in the low-resource language. This method encourages the model to draw parallels between languages and transfer contextual understanding.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CLB against standard few-shot prompting and translation-based methods on tasks like named entity recognition and sentiment analysis across various language pairs, using datasets such as XTREME for benchmarking."

        "Title": "Contextual Language Bridging: Enhancing LLM Performance on Low-Resource Languages through Cross-Lingual Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with low-resource languages due to limited training data and contextual understanding. This leads to poor performance in various natural language processing tasks for these languages, widening the digital divide and limiting the accessibility of AI technologies.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to address this issue often rely on translation or multilingual pretraining, which can be resource-intensive and may not capture the nuances of low-resource languages. By leveraging contextual similarities between high-resource and low-resource languages, we can potentially bridge this gap more efficiently. Our proposed method, Contextual Language Bridging (CLB), aims to utilize the rich contextual understanding of high-resource languages to enhance performance in low-resource languages without the need for extensive additional training or data collection.",
        "Proposed Method": "Contextual Language Bridging (CLB) is a novel prompting technique that leverages contextual cues from related high-resource languages to enhance LLM performance in low-resource languages. The prompt structure includes: (1) A brief description of the task in the high-resource language, (2) Examples of similar contexts in both languages, and (3) The actual task in the low-resource language. This method encourages the model to draw parallels between languages and transfer contextual understanding. The key steps are: 1) Identify a high-resource language that shares linguistic features or historical connections with the target low-resource language. 2) Construct a prompt that includes task description and examples in the high-resource language. 3) Provide parallel examples showing similar contexts in both languages. 4) Present the actual task in the low-resource language.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose datasets for named entity recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis tasks. For NER, use the XTREME benchmark's WikiANN dataset. For sentiment analysis, use the XGLUE benchmark's cross-lingual sentiment classification dataset.",
            "Step 2: Language Pair Selection": "Select 5 language pairs, each consisting of a high-resource and a related low-resource language. For example: (English, Swahili), (Spanish, Quechua), (Hindi, Bhojpuri), (Mandarin, Cantonese), (Arabic, Amazigh).",
            "Step 3: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: 1) Standard few-shot prompting in the low-resource language. 2) Translation-based method where the input is translated to English, processed, and translated back.",
            "Step 4: CLB Prompt Construction": "For each task and language pair, construct CLB prompts following this template: '[Task description in high-resource language] Here are some examples in [high-resource language] and [low-resource language]: [3-5 parallel examples] Now, perform the task for this [low-resource language] input: [actual input]'",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for all experiments.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each task, language pair, and model: 1) Run the baseline few-shot prompting method. 2) Run the translation-based method. 3) Run the CLB method. Use 100 examples from each dataset for evaluation.",
            "Step 7: Evaluation": "For NER, use F1 score. For sentiment analysis, use accuracy. Compare the performance of CLB against the baselines for each language pair and task.",
            "Step 8: Analysis": "Analyze the results to determine: 1) Overall effectiveness of CLB compared to baselines. 2) Performance variations across different language pairs. 3) Task-specific performance differences."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Few-shot in Low-Resource Language)": "Hii ni kazi ya utambuzi wa majina ya vitu. Tafadhali tambua majina ya vitu katika sentensi ifuatayo: Rais Samia alisafiri kutoka Dar es Salaam kwenda Dodoma.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Few-shot in Low-Resource Language)": "Majina ya vitu yaliyotambuliwa: Samia (Mtu), Dar es Salaam (Mahali), Dodoma (Mahali)",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Translation-based)": "This is a named entity recognition task. Please identify the named entities in the following sentence: President Samia traveled from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Translation-based)": "Named entities identified: Samia (Person), Dar es Salaam (Location), Dodoma (Location)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CLB)": "This is a named entity recognition task. Here are some examples in English and Swahili: English: Barack Obama visited New York City. Entities: Barack Obama (Person), New York City (Location) Swahili: Barack Obama alitembelea Jiji la New York. Vitu: Barack Obama (Mtu), New York (Mahali) English: Apple Inc. announced a new iPhone. Entities: Apple Inc. (Organization), iPhone (Product) Swahili: Apple Inc. ilitangaza iPhone mpya. Vitu: Apple Inc. (Shirika), iPhone (Bidhaa) Now, perform the task for this Swahili input: Rais Samia alisafiri kutoka Dar es Salaam kwenda Dodoma.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CLB)": "Vitu vilivyotambuliwa: Samia (Mtu), Dar es Salaam (Mahali), Dodoma (Mahali)",
            "Explanation": "The CLB method provides context in both English and Swahili, allowing the model to draw parallels between the languages and potentially improve its performance on the Swahili input. This approach may lead to more accurate entity recognition compared to the baselines, especially for low-resource languages like Swahili."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the CLB method does not show significant improvements over the baselines, we can explore several alternative approaches. First, we could analyze the generated outputs to identify specific areas where CLB fails, such as certain entity types or linguistic structures. This could inform a refined version of CLB that focuses on these challenging aspects. Second, we could experiment with varying the number and types of examples in the prompt to find an optimal configuration. Third, we could investigate a hybrid approach that combines CLB with other techniques, such as using CLB-generated outputs as additional context for few-shot learning in the low-resource language. Finally, if these approaches don't yield improvements, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of why cross-lingual transfer is challenging for certain language pairs or tasks, potentially uncovering valuable insights about the limitations of current LLMs in multilingual settings."
