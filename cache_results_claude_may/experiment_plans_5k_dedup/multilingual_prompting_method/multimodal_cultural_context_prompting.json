    "idea_name": "Multimodal Cultural Context Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often lack deep understanding of cultural contexts in low-resource languages, leading to culturally inappropriate or misunderstood outputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically rely on text-based cultural information, which may not fully capture the rich, multimodal nature of cultural knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "By incorporating multimodal cultural elements into prompts, we can enhance the LLM's understanding and generation of culturally appropriate content in low-resource languages.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multimodal Cultural Context Prompting (MCCP), a technique that enriches prompts with visual and auditory cultural elements alongside text. The prompt structure includes: 1) A textual description of the task, 2) URLs or descriptions of relevant images (e.g., traditional clothing, artifacts), 3) Descriptions or URLs of relevant audio (e.g., traditional music, spoken dialects), and 4) Instructions to incorporate these cultural elements into the response. For example: 'Generate a story in [LOW_RESOURCE_LANGUAGE] about a traditional festival. Incorporate elements from the following: [IMAGE_URL]: traditional costume, [AUDIO_DESCRIPTION]: folk music rhythm. Ensure the story reflects the cultural significance of these elements.' This method guides the LLM to generate content that is not only linguistically accurate but also culturally rich and appropriate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MCCP on tasks such as cultural event description, traditional story generation, and cross-cultural communication scenarios in various low-resource languages. Compare outputs with those generated using text-only prompts. Assess cultural authenticity and appropriateness through evaluations by native speakers and cultural experts."

        "Title": "Enhancing Cultural Appropriateness in Low-Resource Language Generation through Multimodal Cultural Context Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating culturally appropriate content in low-resource languages due to a lack of deep understanding of cultural contexts. This limitation leads to outputs that may be linguistically accurate but culturally inappropriate or misunderstood.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improving LLMs' performance on low-resource languages typically rely on text-based cultural information, which may not fully capture the rich, multimodal nature of cultural knowledge. By incorporating multimodal cultural elements into prompts, we can potentially enhance the LLM's understanding and generation of culturally appropriate content in low-resource languages. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to process and integrate information from different modalities, potentially leading to more culturally nuanced and appropriate outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Multimodal Cultural Context Prompting (MCCP), a technique that enriches prompts with visual and auditory cultural elements alongside text. The prompt structure includes: 1) A textual description of the task, 2) URLs or descriptions of relevant images (e.g., traditional clothing, artifacts), 3) Descriptions or URLs of relevant audio (e.g., traditional music, spoken dialects), and 4) Instructions to incorporate these cultural elements into the response.

This method aims to guide the LLM to generate content that is not only linguistically accurate but also culturally rich and appropriate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Data Collection": "Collect a dataset of cultural elements for 5 low-resource languages, including text descriptions, image URLs, and audio descriptions related to traditional festivals, customs, and daily life. Ensure diversity in the cultural elements selected.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Prompt Construction": "Create text-only prompts for generating culturally-specific content (e.g., stories about festivals, descriptions of traditions) in the selected low-resource languages.",
            "Step 3: MCCP Prompt Construction": "Develop multimodal prompts following the MCCP structure, incorporating the collected cultural elements (text, image URLs, audio descriptions) for each task and language.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and Claude 2 as the primary models for evaluation, as they have demonstrated capabilities in processing multimodal inputs.",
            "Step 5: Generation Tasks": "Define three generation tasks: 1) Festival story generation, 2) Traditional custom description, and 3) Daily life scenario narration. Generate outputs for each task using both baseline and MCCP prompts.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Develop a rubric for assessing cultural appropriateness and richness, including factors such as accuracy of cultural references, use of culturally-specific language, and overall cultural authenticity. Use this rubric to score the generated outputs.",
            "Step 7: Human Evaluation": "Recruit native speakers or cultural experts for each language to evaluate the generated content using the developed rubric. Ensure evaluators are blind to the prompting method used.",
            "Step 8: Comparative Analysis": "Compare the performance of baseline prompts vs. MCCP across languages and tasks, analyzing both quantitative scores and qualitative feedback from evaluators.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Identify common types of cultural misunderstandings or inappropriate generations in both baseline and MCCP outputs to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach.",
            "Step 10: Ablation Study": "Conduct an ablation study by removing different components of the MCCP (e.g., only text and images, only text and audio) to understand the contribution of each modality to the overall performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Generate a story in Quechua about the Inti Raymi festival.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Inti Raymi pachapi, llaqtakunapi runakuna kusisqa puriranku. Intita yupaychaspa, achka mikhunata waqaychakurqanku. Qusqu llaqtapi, hatun raymita ruwasqanku, tukuy runa tusurqanku, takisqanku. Inka kamachiqpas chaypi karqan, paywan kuska llapa runa Intita yupaychasqanku. Chay p'unchawpi, llapa runa sumaqta p'achallikurqanku, quri qulqi p'achawan. Tukuy tuta ukhupi raymicharqanku, paqarintin p'unchaykama.",
            "Baseline Prompt Explanation": "This output, while in Quechua, lacks specific cultural details and may not fully capture the essence of Inti Raymi. It provides a generic description of a festival without incorporating unique elements of Inca culture.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Generate a story in Quechua about the Inti Raymi festival. Incorporate elements from the following: [IMAGE_URL]: Traditional Inca priest costume with gold sun disk, [AUDIO_DESCRIPTION]: Rhythm of Andean flutes and drums. Ensure the story reflects the cultural significance of these elements and the importance of the sun in Inca culture.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Inti Raymipaq, Qusqu llaqtapi, Willaq Uma, quri inti disk'uwan p'achallikuspan, Qurikancha temploman yaykurqan. Andean kena phukuqkunaq, bombo waqaqkunaq sumaqlla\u00f1a takiynin uyarikurqan. Tawa suyu kamachiqkuna, Sapa Inkawan kuska, intiq lluqsimuyninta suyarqanku. Inti tayta lluqsimuptin, Willaq Uma quri akillawan aqa haywakuyta qallarirqan. Llapa runa qapariyta qallarinku: '\u00a1Inti Tayta kutimun!' Chay pachapi, tukuy ima kawsaqkuna kallpachakun, musuq wata qallariy. Inti Taytanchispa atiyninwan, chakrakunapas sumaqta puqunqa, llaqtakunapas allin kawsaypi kanqa.",
            "Proposed Prompt Explanation": "This output incorporates specific cultural elements such as the Willaq Uma (high priest), the golden sun disk, and the importance of Qurikancha temple. It also references the Andean musical instruments and the ritual of offering chicha to the sun, demonstrating a deeper understanding of Inca culture and the significance of Inti Raymi."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the MCCP method does not significantly improve cultural appropriateness compared to the baseline, we will conduct a detailed analysis of the generated outputs to understand why. This analysis will focus on: 1) Examining how the model interprets and incorporates the multimodal elements, 2) Identifying any patterns in cultural misunderstandings that persist even with MCCP, and 3) Assessing whether the multimodal elements are sufficiently representative of the cultural concepts we aim to convey. Based on these findings, we may explore alternative approaches such as: a) Refining the MCCP structure to provide more explicit instructions on how to incorporate cultural elements, b) Experimenting with different types of multimodal inputs (e.g., video clips, interactive elements) that might better convey cultural context, or c) Investigating a hybrid approach that combines MCCP with other techniques like few-shot learning or cultural knowledge base integration. Additionally, we could pivot the project towards an in-depth analysis of how LLMs process and integrate multimodal cultural information, which could provide valuable insights for future research in this area."
