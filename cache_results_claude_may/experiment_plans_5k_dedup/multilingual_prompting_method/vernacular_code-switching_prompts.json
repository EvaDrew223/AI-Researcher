    "topic_description": "novel prompting methods to improve large language models\u2019 performance on multilingual tasks or low-resource languages and vernacular languages",
    "idea_name": "Vernacular Code-Switching Prompts",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle with understanding and generating text in vernacular languages or dialects, particularly when mixed with standard language usage.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically focus on either standard languages or specific dialects separately, failing to capture the nuanced mixing of language varieties in real-world usage.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting LLMs to engage in code-switching between standard and vernacular forms, we can improve their ability to process and generate more naturalistic language patterns.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Vernacular Code-Switching Prompts (VCSP), a technique that constructs prompts mimicking realistic code-switching patterns between standard and vernacular language. The method involves creating a prompt template that alternates between standard and vernacular expressions, such as 'Translate the following text into a mix of [STANDARD_LANGUAGE] and [VERNACULAR], similar to how a native speaker might naturally switch between them: [INPUT_TEXT]'. Additionally, we include examples of code-switching in the prompt to guide the model's output style. This approach encourages the model to develop a more nuanced understanding of language variation and improve its performance on tasks involving vernacular languages.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test VCSP on tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text generation using datasets that include code-switching between standard and vernacular forms. Compare performance against models trained on standard language data only and those trained on separate vernacular datasets."

        "Title": "Enhancing Multilingual Performance of Large Language Models through Vernacular Code-Switching Prompts (VCSP)",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with understanding and generating text in vernacular languages or dialects, particularly when mixed with standard language usage. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in real-world scenarios where code-switching between standard and vernacular forms is common.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches typically focus on either standard languages or specific dialects separately, failing to capture the nuanced mixing of language varieties in real-world usage. By prompting LLMs to engage in code-switching between standard and vernacular forms, we can improve their ability to process and generate more naturalistic language patterns. This approach leverages the LLMs' existing knowledge and capabilities without requiring extensive retraining or additional data collection.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Vernacular Code-Switching Prompts (VCSP), a technique that constructs prompts mimicking realistic code-switching patterns between standard and vernacular language. The method involves creating a prompt template that alternates between standard and vernacular expressions, such as 'Translate the following text into a mix of [STANDARD_LANGUAGE] and [VERNACULAR], similar to how a native speaker might naturally switch between them: [INPUT_TEXT]'. Additionally, we include examples of code-switching in the prompt to guide the model's output style. This approach encourages the model to develop a more nuanced understanding of language variation and improve its performance on tasks involving vernacular languages.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Collect or create datasets for three tasks: sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and text generation. Each dataset should include examples of code-switching between standard and vernacular forms. For sentiment analysis and NER, use existing datasets like CS-EN (Code-switched English-Hindi) for sentiment analysis and the CALCS (Code-Switching Workshop) shared task dataset for NER. For text generation, create a custom dataset by collecting social media posts or transcripts that exhibit natural code-switching.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Model Selection": "Choose three LLMs for evaluation: GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and an open-source model like XLM-RoBERTa or mT5. These will serve as our baselines and the models we'll apply VCSP to.",
            "Step 3: Baseline Performance Measurement": "Evaluate the baseline performance of each model on the three tasks using standard prompting techniques. For sentiment analysis and NER, use accuracy and F1-score as metrics. For text generation, use BLEU score and human evaluation (if resources allow) to assess fluency and naturalness of code-switching.",
            "Step 4: VCSP Prompt Design": "Design VCSP prompts for each task. For sentiment analysis: 'Analyze the sentiment of the following code-switched text, mixing [STANDARD_LANGUAGE] and [VERNACULAR] in your response: [INPUT_TEXT]'. For NER: 'Identify and label named entities in the following code-switched text, using a mix of [STANDARD_LANGUAGE] and [VERNACULAR] in your response: [INPUT_TEXT]'. For text generation: 'Generate a response to the following prompt, naturally mixing [STANDARD_LANGUAGE] and [VERNACULAR] as a bilingual speaker would: [INPUT_TEXT]'.",
            "Step 5: VCSP Implementation": "Apply the VCSP technique to each model. This involves prepending the designed prompts to the input text and including 2-3 examples of code-switched responses in the prompt to guide the model's output style.",
            "Step 6: VCSP Performance Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of each model using VCSP on the three tasks, using the same metrics as in Step 3.",
            "Step 7: Comparative Analysis": "Compare the performance of VCSP against the baseline for each model and task. Analyze improvements in accuracy, fluency, and naturalness of code-switching.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of VCSP. Test variations such as: (1) using only vernacular language in prompts, (2) using only standard language in prompts, (3) varying the number of code-switched examples in the prompt.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Perform a detailed error analysis on cases where VCSP underperforms compared to the baseline. Categorize error types and identify potential areas for improvement.",
            "Step 10: Results Compilation and Reporting": "Compile all results, analyses, and insights into a comprehensive report. Include quantitative metrics, qualitative observations, and representative examples of improved outputs using VCSP."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Sentiment analysis task: 'Yeh movie bohot boring thi, I didn't enjoy it at all.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Negative sentiment",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (VCSP)": "Analyze the sentiment of the following code-switched text, mixing English and Hindi in your response: 'Yeh movie bohot boring thi, I didn't enjoy it at all.' Example: 'Is sentence mein negative sentiment hai kyunki speaker ne movie ko boring bataya aur kaha ki they didn't enjoy it.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (VCSP)": "Is sentence mein clearly negative sentiment express kiya gaya hai. Speaker ne movie ko 'bohot boring' kaha, jo ek strong negative description hai. Phir unhone add kiya 'I didn't enjoy it at all', jo further reinforce karta hai ki unka experience completely unsatisfactory tha. Overall, yeh statement shows ki viewer ko movie bilkul pasand nahi aayi.",
            "Explanation": "The VCSP approach encourages the model to provide a more detailed and nuanced analysis while naturally code-switching between English and Hindi, demonstrating a better understanding of the input's linguistic context."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If VCSP does not significantly improve performance across tasks, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of why code-switching prompts may not be effective for certain language pairs or tasks. This could involve: (1) Analyzing the linguistic features of successful vs. unsuccessful code-switching examples to identify patterns. (2) Investigating whether the effectiveness of VCSP varies based on the syntactic similarity between the standard and vernacular languages. (3) Exploring whether certain tasks benefit more from code-switching prompts than others, and hypothesizing reasons for these differences. (4) Examining if the model's pre-training data influences its ability to handle code-switched prompts effectively. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs in handling multilingual contexts and suggest future directions for improving multilingual capabilities."
