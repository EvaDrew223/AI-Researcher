    "idea_name": "Dynamic Language Complexity Adaptation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often generate text at a fixed complexity level, which may not be suitable for users with different language proficiencies, especially in low-resource languages.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches typically involve creating separate models or prompts for different proficiency levels, which lacks flexibility and requires multiple resources.",
        "Motivation": "By dynamically adjusting the complexity of generated text based on user feedback, we can create more accessible and effective communication across different language proficiency levels.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Dynamic Language Complexity Adaptation (DLCA), a prompting technique that iteratively adjusts the complexity of generated text. The process begins with a standard prompt for the task, followed by a complexity adjustment instruction: 'Generate the response, then adjust its complexity based on the following feedback: [FEEDBACK]'. The feedback can be simulated user input or automated metrics indicating whether the text should be simplified or made more complex. The LLM then regenerates the text according to the feedback. This process can be repeated multiple times, with prompts like 'Simplify the following text while preserving its meaning: [TEXT]' or 'Elaborate on the following text to increase its complexity: [TEXT]'. This approach allows for fine-tuned control over the output complexity, making content more accessible for learners or more sophisticated for advanced users.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Test DLCA on various text generation tasks (e.g., news summarization, educational content creation) in multiple languages, including low-resource ones. Evaluate the output at different complexity levels using readability metrics, user studies with language learners, and expert assessments of content preservation."

        "Title": "Dynamic Language Complexity Adaptation: Improving LLM Performance on Multilingual and Low-Resource Language Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate text at a fixed complexity level, which may not be suitable for users with different language proficiencies, especially in low-resource languages. This limitation hinders effective communication and accessibility across diverse language backgrounds.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods typically involve creating separate models or prompts for different proficiency levels, which lacks flexibility and requires multiple resources. By dynamically adjusting the complexity of generated text based on user feedback, we can create more accessible and effective communication across different language proficiency levels. This approach leverages the LLM's inherent capabilities to adapt its output, potentially improving performance on multilingual and low-resource language tasks without the need for extensive retraining or multiple specialized models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Dynamic Language Complexity Adaptation (DLCA), a prompting technique that iteratively adjusts the complexity of generated text. The process begins with a standard prompt for the task, followed by a complexity adjustment instruction: 'Generate the response, then adjust its complexity based on the following feedback: [FEEDBACK]'.

This approach allows for fine-tuned control over the output complexity, making content more accessible for learners or more sophisticated for advanced users.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "Select datasets for evaluation: (1) XQuAD for multilingual question answering, covering 11 languages. (2) FLORES-101 for machine translation, focusing on low-resource language pairs. (3) MultiATIS++ for intent classification and slot filling in low-resource languages.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Implementation": "Implement standard prompting methods for each task: (1) Direct prompting: Use the task input directly as the prompt. (2) Few-shot prompting: Include 2-3 examples in the prompt before the actual input.",
            "Step 3: DLCA Implementation": "Implement the DLCA method: (1) Initial generation: Use the task input to generate an initial response. (2) Complexity assessment: Use automated metrics (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid readability score) to determine the current complexity level. (3) Feedback generation: Based on the assessment, generate feedback for simplification or elaboration. (4) Regeneration: Prompt the LLM to adjust the text based on the feedback. (5) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 for a set number of iterations (e.g., 3) or until the desired complexity level is reached.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI API for the experiments. Also include an open-source multilingual model like XLM-RoBERTa-large for comparison.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Implement task-specific metrics: (1) XQuAD: F1 score and Exact Match. (2) FLORES-101: BLEU score. (3) MultiATIS++: Intent Classification Accuracy and Slot Filling F1 score. Additionally, implement complexity metrics: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and BLEU score between original and simplified/elaborated versions.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and model: (1) Run baseline methods and record performance. (2) Run DLCA method with different iteration counts (1, 3, 5) and record performance. (3) For DLCA, also record intermediate outputs at each iteration to analyze the adaptation process.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare DLCA performance against baselines across different languages and resource levels. Analyze how performance changes with the number of iterations. Examine the relationship between complexity changes and task performance improvements."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Translate the following English sentence to French: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Le rapide renard brun saute par-dessus le chien paresseux.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DLCA; Initial Generation)": "Translate the following English sentence to French: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.' Then, adjust the complexity of the translation based on the following feedback: [FEEDBACK]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DLCA; Initial Generation)": "Le rapide renard brun saute par-dessus le chien paresseux.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (DLCA; Complexity Adjustment)": "The current translation is: 'Le rapide renard brun saute par-dessus le chien paresseux.' Simplify this French translation while preserving its meaning, aiming for a lower language proficiency level.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (DLCA; Complexity Adjustment)": "Le renard vite et marron saute au-dessus du chien qui dort.",
            "Explanation": "The DLCA method allows for dynamic adjustment of the translation's complexity. The simplified version uses more common words ('vite' instead of 'rapide', 'marron' instead of 'brun') and simpler structures ('qui dort' instead of 'paresseux'), making it more accessible for learners with lower French proficiency."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the DLCA method does not show significant improvements over baselines, we can pivot the project to an in-depth analysis of how language complexity affects LLM performance across different languages and tasks. We could investigate: (1) The relationship between text complexity and model performance for different language families and resource levels. (2) How different complexity adjustment strategies (simplification vs. elaboration) affect performance on various NLP tasks. (3) The limitations of current automated readability metrics for non-English languages and propose potential improvements. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the challenges of multilingual NLP and guide future research in developing more adaptable language models."
