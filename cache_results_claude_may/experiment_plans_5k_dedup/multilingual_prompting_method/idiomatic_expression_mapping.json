    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs struggle with understanding and translating idiomatic expressions in low-resource languages and vernaculars.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on literal translations or large parallel corpora of idiomatic expressions.",
        "Motivation": "By mapping idiomatic expressions to their semantic meanings and cultural contexts, we can improve the model's understanding across languages.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Idiomatic Expression Mapping (IEM), a prompting technique that: (1) Identifies idiomatic expressions in the input, (2) Prompts the model to explain the literal meaning, figurative meaning, and cultural context of each expression, (3) Provides similar idioms or expressions in a high-resource language, (4) Asks the model to complete the task using this enriched understanding. This method allows the model to grasp the nuanced meanings of idiomatic expressions and find appropriate equivalents across languages.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IEM against standard translation and few-shot prompting methods on tasks like machine translation and cross-lingual sentiment analysis, using datasets that include idiomatic expressions such as PAWS-X and a custom-curated dataset of multilingual idioms."

        "Title": "Idiomatic Expression Mapping (IEM): Enhancing LLMs' Performance on Multilingual and Low-Resource Language Tasks",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with understanding and translating idiomatic expressions in low-resource languages and vernaculars, leading to inaccurate translations and misinterpretations in cross-lingual tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to handling idiomatic expressions in LLMs often rely on literal translations or large parallel corpora, which are not always available or effective for low-resource languages. By mapping idiomatic expressions to their semantic meanings and cultural contexts, we can potentially improve the model's understanding across languages without the need for extensive parallel data. This method could leverage the LLM's existing knowledge to bridge the gap between languages and cultures, potentially improving performance on various multilingual tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Idiomatic Expression Mapping (IEM), a prompting technique that enhances LLMs' understanding of idiomatic expressions across languages. IEM consists of four main steps: (1) Identification of idiomatic expressions in the input, (2) Explanation of the literal meaning, figurative meaning, and cultural context of each expression, (3) Provision of similar idioms or expressions in a high-resource language, and (4) Task completion using this enriched understanding. This method allows the model to grasp the nuanced meanings of idiomatic expressions and find appropriate equivalents across languages.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use two main datasets: (1) PAWS-X for cross-lingual paraphrase identification, focusing on the English, French, and Spanish subsets. (2) A custom-curated dataset of multilingual idioms, which we will create by collecting 1000 idiomatic expressions each from English, French, and Spanish, along with their literal translations, figurative meanings, and cultural contexts. For the custom dataset, we will use existing idiom collections and collaborate with native speakers to ensure accuracy.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation": "Implement two baseline methods: (1) Standard translation: Use the LLM to directly translate the input text containing idiomatic expressions. (2) Few-shot prompting: Provide a few examples of correctly translated idiomatic expressions before asking the model to translate the input text.",
            "Step 3: IEM Implementation": "Implement the IEM method with the following steps: (1) Identification: Prompt the LLM to identify idiomatic expressions in the input text. (2) Explanation: For each identified expression, prompt the LLM to explain its literal meaning, figurative meaning, and cultural context. (3) Cross-lingual mapping: Prompt the LLM to provide similar idioms or expressions in English (as a high-resource language). (4) Task completion: Use this enriched understanding to complete the original task (e.g., translation or paraphrase identification).",
            "Step 4: Experiment Setup": "We will use GPT-4 as our primary LLM for all experiments. For each task and method, we will use a sample size of 1000 examples from each language pair. We will evaluate performance using the following metrics: (1) For PAWS-X: Accuracy and F1 score. (2) For the custom idiom dataset: BLEU score for translations, and human evaluation for translation quality and idiom preservation.",
            "Step 5: Conducting Experiments": "Run experiments for both baseline methods and IEM on the PAWS-X dataset and the custom idiom dataset. For PAWS-X, focus on cross-lingual paraphrase identification. For the custom dataset, focus on translating sentences containing idiomatic expressions.",
            "Step 6: Human Evaluation": "Recruit bilingual human evaluators to assess the quality of translations and preservation of idiomatic meanings for a subset of 100 examples from each language pair in the custom idiom dataset. Use a 5-point Likert scale for both translation quality and idiom preservation.",
            "Step 7: Analysis": "Compare the performance of IEM against the baseline methods using the metrics mentioned in Step 4. Conduct statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to verify if the improvements are significant. Analyze the results to identify patterns in where IEM performs well or struggles, considering factors such as idiom complexity, cultural specificity, and language pair."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Standard Translation)": "Translate the following French sentence to English: 'Il pleut des cordes aujourd'hui.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Standard Translation)": "It's raining ropes today.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Few-shot Prompting)": "Translate the following idiomatic expressions:\nFrench: 'Co\u00fbter les yeux de la t\u00eate' \u2192 English: 'To cost an arm and a leg'\nSpanish: 'Estar como pez en el agua' \u2192 English: 'To be in one's element'\nNow translate this French sentence to English: 'Il pleut des cordes aujourd'hui.'",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Few-shot Prompting)": "It's raining cats and dogs today.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IEM; Step 1: Identification)": "Identify any idiomatic expressions in the following French sentence: 'Il pleut des cordes aujourd'hui.'",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IEM; Step 1: Identification)": "The idiomatic expression in this sentence is 'Il pleut des cordes', which literally translates to 'It's raining ropes'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IEM; Step 2: Explanation)": "Explain the literal meaning, figurative meaning, and cultural context of the French idiomatic expression 'Il pleut des cordes'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IEM; Step 2: Explanation)": "Literal meaning: 'It's raining ropes'\nFigurative meaning: It's raining very heavily\nCultural context: This expression is commonly used in French to describe extremely heavy rainfall. The image of ropes of rain emphasizes the intensity and continuity of the downpour.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IEM; Step 3: Cross-lingual mapping)": "Provide a similar idiomatic expression in English that conveys the same meaning as the French expression 'Il pleut des cordes'.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IEM; Step 3: Cross-lingual mapping)": "A similar English idiomatic expression is 'It's raining cats and dogs', which also means it's raining very heavily.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (IEM; Step 4: Task completion)": "Translate the French sentence 'Il pleut des cordes aujourd'hui' to English, taking into account the idiomatic expression and its meaning.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (IEM; Step 4: Task completion)": "It's raining cats and dogs today.",
            "Explanation": "The IEM method allows for a more nuanced understanding and translation of the idiomatic expression. While the standard translation might result in a literal and potentially confusing translation, and few-shot prompting might sometimes work but lacks consistency, IEM provides a structured approach to understanding and translating idioms. It identifies the expression, explains its meaning and context, finds a suitable equivalent in the target language, and then uses this information to produce an accurate and natural-sounding translation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IEM method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can pivot our research in several directions. First, we could conduct a detailed error analysis to understand where IEM fails and why. This might involve categorizing errors (e.g., misidentification of idioms, incorrect explanations, inappropriate cross-lingual mappings) and analyzing their frequencies and impacts. Second, we could explore combining IEM with other techniques, such as retrieval-augmented generation, to provide additional context for idiom understanding. Third, we could investigate the impact of IEM on different types of idiomatic expressions (e.g., fully opaque vs. semi-transparent idioms) or on different language families. This could lead to insights about the method's strengths and limitations across diverse linguistic contexts. Finally, we could shift our focus to analyze how IEM affects the model's reasoning process, even if it doesn't always lead to better final outputs. This could involve examining the intermediate outputs at each step of IEM and how they influence the model's decision-making, potentially offering valuable insights into how LLMs process and reason about idiomatic language."
