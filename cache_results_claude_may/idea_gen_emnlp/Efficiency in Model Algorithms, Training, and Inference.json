Our method uses a lightweight neural network to predict an attention mask, which is then applied to the full attention matrix. This mask is trained end-to-end with the main model, allowing it to learn optimal sparsity patterns for different tasks and inputs. Additionally, we introduce a novel regularization technique that encourages the mask to be sparse while maintaining important connections. To further improve efficiency, we implement a custom CUDA kernel that efficiently computes sparse attention, taking advantage of the predicted mask structure.",

Our approach uses a reinforcement learning agent to determine the optimal number of gradient accumulation steps based on various signals such as gradient variance, validation performance, and available memory. The agent learns to balance between larger effective batch sizes for better gradient estimates and more frequent updates for faster convergence. We also introduce a novel technique for maintaining an approximation of batch normalization statistics across accumulated gradients, allowing for more stable training with large effective batch sizes.

This hierarchical structure allows for linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Additionally, we introduce a novel sparse attention mechanism within each level, where attention patterns are learned during training to focus on the most relevant tokens. This combines the benefits of hierarchical modeling with adaptive sparsity, potentially leading to significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.",

MPAT uses a lightweight importance scoring mechanism to assess the criticality of each model component (e.g., attention heads, feed-forward layers) to the current task. Based on these scores, it adaptively assigns higher precision and learning rates to critical components while using lower precision for less important parts. This approach not only reduces memory usage and computational requirements but also acts as an implicit regularization mechanism, potentially improving generalization. Additionally, MPAT includes a periodic re-evaluation step to adjust precision assignments as the model's behavior evolves during training.",

NCEF starts with a pretrained model and progressively compresses it during fine-tuning using a learnable neural compressor. This compressor, which itself is a small neural network, learns to map the full model's parameters to a compact latent space. During fine-tuning, we optimize both the task-specific loss and a reconstruction loss that ensures the compressed representation can accurately recover the original model's behavior. The compressor is trained to capture task-relevant information, resulting in highly efficient, task-specific compressed models. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic compression rate that adapts based on validation performance, allowing NCEF to automatically find the optimal compression-performance trade-off for each task.",

FCL-LLM uses a federated learning setup where multiple clients locally update model copies on their private data. To address catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a new continual learning technique called 'Adaptive Sparse Replay,' which selectively stores and replays a sparse set of synthetic examples generated from the model's current knowledge. This set is dynamically updated based on the importance and novelty of information. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning approach to optimize the model's ability to quickly adapt to new tasks without forgetting old ones. FCL-LLM also includes a central aggregation server that uses differential privacy techniques to securely combine client updates while preserving individual privacy.",

NSDEI uses a large language model as a teacher to train a much smaller student model with a neuro-symbolic architecture. The student model consists of a neural component for perception and a symbolic component for reasoning. During distillation, we not only match the output of the teacher model but also extract symbolic rules and reasoning steps from the teacher's internal representations. These extracted rules are used to guide the symbolic component of the student model. We introduce a novel 'Symbolic Trace Alignment' loss that encourages the student's neural component to produce representations that align with the extracted symbolic rules. Additionally, we employ a curriculum learning strategy that gradually increases the complexity of tasks during distillation, allowing the student to build up reasoning capabilities incrementally.",

The model begins with a minimal number of attention heads, layers, and hidden dimensions. As training progresses, we gradually expand these dimensions based on performance metrics. This expansion is done by adding new randomly initialized parameters and copying existing parameters. The expansion process is guided by a learnable policy that decides when and how to expand each dimension.

The curriculum is automatically generated and adjusted using reinforcement learning, where the reward is based on the student model's performance relative to the teacher. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic teacher ensemble, where different teacher models or components are activated based on the current curriculum stage. This allows for more targeted knowledge transfer at different stages of the distillation process.",
