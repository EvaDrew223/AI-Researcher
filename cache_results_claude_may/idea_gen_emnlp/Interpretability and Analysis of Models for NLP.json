            "Neuron-Level Interpretability Framework": {
                "Problem": "Current interpretability methods for NLP models often focus on high-level features or overall model behavior, lacking granular insights into individual neuron contributions.",
                "Existing Work": "Techniques like attention visualization and probing classifiers provide some interpretability, but typically at a coarse-grained level.",
                "Motivation": "Understanding individual neuron roles could lead to more targeted model improvements and deeper insights into language representation learning.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel neuron-level interpretability framework for transformer-based NLP models. Our method combines causal intervention techniques with large-scale neuron activation analysis. We systematically ablate individual neurons and neuron groups, measuring their impact on various linguistic tasks. We then use these measurements to construct a comprehensive 'neuron importance map' across different layers and attention heads. To make this analysis tractable for large models, we employ efficient sparse sampling techniques and distributed computing. Additionally, we develop a new visualization tool that allows interactive exploration of neuron-level contributions to specific predictions.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will apply our framework to popular models like BERT and GPT on tasks including named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. We'll compare neuron importance maps across models and tasks, hypothesizing that certain neurons consistently contribute to specific linguistic phenomena. We'll also investigate how fine-tuning affects neuron roles. Evaluation will include both quantitative metrics (e.g., correlation between neuron importance and task performance) and qualitative analysis by linguistics experts."

            "Cross-Lingual Concept Alignment": {
                "Problem": "Multilingual NLP models often struggle with accurately representing and aligning concepts across different languages, leading to inconsistencies in cross-lingual tasks.",
                "Existing Work": "Current approaches mainly focus on aligning word embeddings or using parallel corpora for training, but these methods often fail to capture nuanced conceptual differences between languages.",
                "Motivation": "Improving cross-lingual concept alignment could significantly enhance machine translation, multilingual sentiment analysis, and cross-cultural NLP applications.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a novel 'Cross-Lingual Concept Alignment' (CLCA) framework. Our approach combines large-scale multilingual knowledge graphs with neural concept representations learned from contextual embeddings. We develop a new 'concept projection' technique that maps language-specific concept representations onto a shared, language-agnostic conceptual space. This projection is learned through a multi-task objective that includes cross-lingual retrieval, translation, and concept similarity judgments. To handle concepts that don't have direct translations, we introduce a 'fuzzy alignment' mechanism that represents concepts as distributions in the shared space.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CLCA on a diverse set of languages, including low-resource ones. Tasks will include cross-lingual word sense disambiguation, multilingual text classification, and zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. We'll compare against baselines like mBERT and XLM-R. We hypothesize that CLCA will show particular improvements on tasks involving culturally-specific concepts or idiomatic expressions. We'll also conduct a detailed analysis of how well CLCA captures subtle cross-lingual semantic differences, using human expert evaluations."

            "Temporal Dynamics of Language Model Knowledge": {
                "Problem": "Large language models trained on web corpora implicitly encode temporal information, but we lack a systematic understanding of how this knowledge evolves and degrades over time.",
                "Existing Work": "Some studies have examined model performance on time-sensitive tasks, but a comprehensive analysis of temporal knowledge dynamics is missing.",
                "Motivation": "Understanding temporal aspects of model knowledge could inform strategies for keeping models up-to-date and handling time-sensitive queries.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a framework for analyzing the 'Temporal Dynamics of Language Model Knowledge' (TeDLaMK). Our approach involves creating a large-scale, time-stratified benchmark covering various domains (e.g., current events, technology, pop culture) across multiple time periods. We then develop a suite of probing tasks designed to measure different aspects of temporal knowledge, including factual recall, temporal reasoning, and awareness of change over time. To analyze how knowledge degrades, we introduce a novel 'temporal decay analysis' technique that tracks changes in model confidence and accuracy for facts from different time periods. We also propose a 'temporal conflict resolution' task to assess how models handle contradictory information from different time periods.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will apply TeDLaMK to popular models like GPT-3, BERT, and T5, analyzing how their temporal knowledge differs. We'll investigate how fine-tuning on recent data affects temporal dynamics. We hypothesize that models will show non-uniform decay of temporal knowledge, with some domains degrading faster than others. We'll also explore potential mitigation strategies, such as temporally-aware training regimes or dynamic knowledge injection methods. Evaluation will include both automatic metrics and human evaluation of model outputs on time-sensitive tasks."

                "Existing Work": "Current defenses often focus on data augmentation or adversarial training, which can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to novel attack types.",
                "Motivation": "Developing more robust models could improve reliability in critical NLP applications and provide insights into language understanding.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel approach called 'Adversarial Robustness Through Semantic Decomposition' (ARTSD). The core idea is to decompose input text into abstract semantic representations before processing. We develop a new 'semantic abstraction layer' that transforms text into a graph-based representation capturing key entities, relations, and logical structures. This layer is trained using a combination of supervised learning on annotated data and self-supervised learning on large text corpora. The abstracted representation is then processed by the main model before being 'recomposed' into natural language output. By operating on this abstract representation, the model becomes inherently more robust to surface-level perturbations. We also introduce a 'semantic consistency checker' that verifies the logical coherence of the abstract representations, providing an additional defense against adversarial inputs.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ARTSD on a range of NLP tasks including text classification, natural language inference, and question answering. We'll test against state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods, including gradient-based, genetic algorithm-based, and human-crafted attacks. We hypothesize that ARTSD will show significantly improved robustness compared to baseline models, particularly for attacks that preserve semantic meaning. We'll also analyze the trade-offs between robustness and standard task performance, and investigate whether ARTSD leads to improved generalization to out-of-distribution data."

                "Existing Work": "Most existing evaluation metrics focus on single modalities or simple cross-modal alignment, failing to capture deeper aspects of multimodal coherence.",
                "Motivation": "Better evaluation of multimodal coherence could guide the development of more reliable and contextually appropriate multimodal systems.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a 'Multimodal Coherence Evaluation Framework' (MuCEF) designed to assess the semantic and logical consistency of model outputs across text, images, and audio. At the core of MuCEF is a novel 'cross-modal reasoning graph' that represents key concepts and their relationships across modalities. We develop a set of coherence metrics that operate on this graph, including 'modal consistency' (agreement between modalities), 'contextual appropriateness' (fit with the given context or task), and 'logical flow' (sensible progression of ideas). To generate these graphs and compute metrics, we fine-tune a large language model to act as a 'multimodal coherence judge'. We also introduce a 'multimodal perturbation generator' that creates challenging test cases by introducing subtle inconsistencies across modalities.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will apply MuCEF to evaluate several state-of-the-art multimodal models on tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and multimodal dialogue. We'll compare MuCEF scores with human judgments and existing metrics. We hypothesize that MuCEF will correlate more strongly with human evaluations of coherence and will be more sensitive to subtle cross-modal inconsistencies. We'll also use MuCEF to analyze how different model architectures and training strategies affect multimodal coherence, potentially yielding insights for improved model design."

                "Problem": "Large language models' (LLMs) knowledge and behavior can change over time due to continuous pre-training or fine-tuning, but detecting and quantifying these changes remains challenging.",
                "Existing Work": "Current approaches mainly focus on evaluating models' performance on specific tasks or datasets, which may not capture subtle shifts in the underlying conceptual understanding.",
                "Motivation": "Detecting concept drift is crucial for maintaining model reliability, updating deployed systems, and understanding how LLMs evolve. A comprehensive framework for detecting and measuring concept drift could provide valuable insights into model behavior and help in model maintenance and improvement.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel framework for detecting and quantifying concept drift in LLMs. Our method involves: 1) Generating a diverse set of prompts that probe various aspects of the model's knowledge and capabilities. 2) Developing a set of metrics to measure changes in the model's responses, including semantic similarity, factual consistency, and task performance. 3) Using these metrics to create a 'concept stability index' that quantifies how much a model's understanding of different concepts has changed. 4) Employing visualization techniques to map the evolution of concepts and their relationships over time. 5) Implementing an alert system that flags significant changes in specific knowledge domains or capabilities.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will apply our framework to multiple versions of popular LLMs (e.g., GPT variants, BERT variants) released over time. We'll compare the detected concept drifts with documented model changes and evaluate our method's ability to identify both expected and unexpected shifts in model behavior. We'll also conduct ablation studies to determine the most effective components of our framework."

                "Problem": "Current methods for explaining LLM decisions often lack the ability to provide intuitive, human-understandable explanations, especially in terms of counterfactuals - what would need to change for the model to make a different decision?",
                "Existing Work": "Existing interpretability methods often focus on attention visualization or feature importance, which can be difficult for non-experts to interpret.",
                "Motivation": "Counterfactual explanations are a powerful tool for human understanding, as they provide concrete examples of how inputs could be changed to alter the output. Automating the generation of such explanations for LLMs could greatly enhance their interpretability and trustworthiness.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a Counterfactual Explanation Generator (CEG) for LLMs. The CEG will: 1) Take an input-output pair from an LLM as its starting point. 2) Use a separate LLM as a 'reasoner' to generate potential counterfactuals. 3) Iteratively test these counterfactuals against the original LLM to find minimal changes that alter the output. 4) Rank and present the most plausible and informative counterfactuals. 5) Provide a natural language explanation of why these changes would alter the model's decision. The CEG will be designed to work across various NLP tasks, from classification to generation.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the CEG on a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, and question answering. We'll measure the quality of generated counterfactuals in terms of minimality (how small the change is), plausibility (how realistic the counterfactual is), and effectiveness (whether it actually changes the model's output). We'll also conduct human evaluations to assess the interpretability and usefulness of the generated explanations."

                "Existing Work": "Most attention analyses focus on static snapshots or aggregated patterns, missing the dynamic nature of attention throughout sequence processing.",
                "Motivation": "Understanding the dynamic evolution of attention could provide crucial insights into how LLMs process information sequentially, potentially revealing new aspects of their reasoning processes and limitations.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce Dynamic Attention Probing (DAP), a framework for analyzing and visualizing the evolution of attention patterns in transformers. DAP will: 1) Track attention weights for each token at every layer and time step during sequence processing. 2) Develop metrics to quantify attention stability, shifts, and focus over time. 3) Identify critical 'attention events' where significant changes occur. 4) Create interactive visualizations that allow researchers to 'play back' the attention process, zooming in on interesting moments. 5) Correlate attention dynamics with model performance and input characteristics. 6) Implement a comparison tool to contrast attention dynamics across different model architectures or versions.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will apply DAP to various transformer-based models on tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as multi-hop question answering and long document summarization. We'll analyze how attention dynamics differ between successful and unsuccessful attempts, and between easy and difficult inputs. We'll also conduct ablation studies to identify which aspects of attention dynamics are most predictive of model performance."

                "Proposed Study": "We propose Semantic Decomposition Trees (SDTs), a novel method for hierarchically decomposing and visualizing the semantic structure of LLM outputs. SDTs will: 1) Use a combination of attention patterns and hidden state analysis to identify semantic units at different levels of abstraction. 2) Construct a tree structure representing how these semantic units are combined and refined throughout the model's layers. 3) Employ a clustering algorithm to group similar semantic units across different inputs, allowing for comparison of reasoning patterns. 4) Develop an interactive visualization tool that allows users to explore the SDT, zooming in and out of different levels of semantic abstraction. 5) Implement a comparison feature to contrast SDTs across different inputs, model versions, or even different LLMs.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will apply SDTs to analyze LLM outputs on a variety of tasks, including summarization, question answering, and creative writing. We'll evaluate the coherence and interpretability of the generated trees through human expert analysis. We'll also investigate whether certain patterns in SDTs correlate with output quality or specific types of errors. Finally, we'll conduct a user study to assess how well SDTs enhance non-expert understanding of LLM reasoning processes."

CST involves systematically perturbing input contexts (e.g., adding/removing words, changing word order) and tracing the propagation of these changes through the model's layers. We'll develop a set of metrics to quantify contextual sensitivity at different levels: token embeddings, attention patterns, intermediate layer activations, and final outputs. Additionally, we'll create visualizations that map how different parts of the input influence various aspects of the output across different contexts.",
