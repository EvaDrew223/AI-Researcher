            "Cross-Modal Attention Alignment": {
                "Problem": "Current multimodal models often struggle to align attention between different modalities, leading to mismatches in understanding and generation tasks.",
                "Existing Work": "Existing approaches typically use separate encoders for each modality and then fuse the representations, which can lead to misalignment.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by cognitive science research on how humans integrate information across senses, we propose a novel approach to align attention mechanisms across modalities.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a Cross-Modal Attention Alignment (CMAA) architecture that explicitly aligns attention maps between visual and textual modalities. The CMAA module takes as input the attention maps from both the vision and language transformers and learns to align them through a series of cross-modal attention operations. This alignment is performed at multiple levels of the network, allowing for fine-grained correspondence between modalities. Additionally, we incorporate a contrastive loss that encourages similar attention patterns for semantically related visual and textual elements while pushing apart unrelated ones. To handle the discrete nature of text and the continuous nature of images, we introduce a novel quantization layer that bridges this gap in a differentiable manner.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CMAA on a range of multimodal tasks including visual question answering, image captioning, and visual reasoning. Baselines will include state-of-the-art multimodal transformers without explicit attention alignment. We will use standard metrics for each task (e.g., VQA accuracy, BLEU for captioning) as well as introduce new metrics to measure the quality of cross-modal alignment. We will also conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of CMAA."

                "Problem": "Current language models lack grounding in physical experiences, limiting their understanding of spatial and physical concepts.",
                "Existing Work": "Most work on language grounding in robotics focuses on mapping language to predefined actions or objects, rather than learning language through interaction.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by how children learn language through physical interaction with their environment, we propose a framework for robots to acquire language through embodied experiences.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce an Embodied Language Acquisition (ELA) framework where a robotic agent interacts with its environment to learn language. The robot is equipped with a large language model as its base, but initially has no understanding of physical concepts or spatial relations. Through a series of interactions (e.g., pushing objects, grasping, navigating), the robot receives textual descriptions of its actions and their outcomes. These descriptions are used to fine-tune the language model, gradually building an understanding of physical concepts. We implement a curiosity-driven exploration mechanism that encourages the robot to perform actions that lead to novel linguistic descriptions. Additionally, we develop a meta-learning component that allows the robot to quickly adapt its language understanding to new environments and tasks.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the ELA framework in both simulated and real-world environments. The robot will be tasked with understanding and generating descriptions of physical scenarios, as well as following instructions involving spatial and physical concepts. We will compare ELA against traditional language models and robots trained on static datasets. Metrics will include accuracy on physical concept understanding tasks, ability to follow complex instructions, and generation of accurate descriptions of novel physical scenarios. We will also conduct a longitudinal study to track the robot's language acquisition over time."

                "Problem": "Multimodal models often generate content that is inconsistent with the provided visual or auditory information, a phenomenon known as cross-modal hallucination.",
                "Existing Work": "Current approaches mainly focus on hallucination detection in unimodal settings or use simple consistency checks in multimodal contexts.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by human cognitive processes of error detection and correction, we propose a system that not only detects but also corrects cross-modal hallucinations in real-time.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a Multimodal Hallucination Detection and Correction (MHDC) system. The MHDC consists of three main components: 1) A cross-modal consistency checker that compares generated text with visual and auditory inputs using a novel graph-based representation that captures relationships between entities across modalities. 2) A hallucination classifier trained on a large dataset of human-annotated multimodal hallucinations, using features from the consistency checker. 3) A correction module that, upon detecting a hallucination, generates alternative outputs that are consistent with the multimodal input. This module uses a retrieval-augmented generation approach, retrieving similar correct examples from a curated database and adapting them to the current context. Additionally, we implement an active learning component that continuously improves the system by soliciting human feedback on ambiguous cases.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MHDC on a range of multimodal tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, and audio-visual scene description. We will create a new benchmark dataset specifically for multimodal hallucination detection and correction. Metrics will include hallucination detection accuracy, correction quality (measured by human evaluation and automated metrics), and the system's ability to improve over time. We will compare MHDC against existing unimodal hallucination detection methods and simpler consistency checking approaches."

                "Existing Work": "Existing approaches typically use static knowledge bases or struggle to update their knowledge representations on-the-fly.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by how humans continuously update their mental models of the world based on multimodal inputs, we propose a system that dynamically constructs and updates a multimodal knowledge graph.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a Dynamic Multimodal Knowledge Graph (DMKG) system that continuously constructs and updates a knowledge graph from multimodal inputs. The DMKG uses a novel neural architecture that can extract entities and relationships from text, images, and audio in real-time. It employs a self-attention mechanism to fuse information across modalities and a graph transformer to update the knowledge graph structure. The system includes a confidence scoring mechanism for each piece of information, allowing for uncertainty representation and conflict resolution. We also implement a forgetting mechanism inspired by human memory models, which prunes less relevant or outdated information. Additionally, we develop a query engine that can answer complex multimodal queries by reasoning over the DMKG.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DMKG on a new benchmark we call MultimodalKG, which involves constructing knowledge graphs from streaming multimodal data (e.g., news feeds with text, images, and videos) and answering complex queries. We will measure the accuracy of entity and relationship extraction, the coherence and completeness of the constructed knowledge graph, and the system's ability to answer queries that require cross-modal reasoning. We will compare DMKG against static knowledge graph approaches and other dynamic but unimodal systems. We will also conduct a longitudinal study to assess how well DMKG adapts to changing information over time."

                "Problem": "Few-shot learning in multimodal settings remains challenging, especially when dealing with concepts that span multiple modalities.",
                "Existing Work": "Current few-shot learning approaches often struggle with multimodal data or rely heavily on large pre-trained models.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by humans' ability to quickly learn new concepts by abstracting and relating them to existing knowledge, we propose a novel approach to multimodal few-shot learning.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a Multimodal Conceptual Abstraction Network (MCAN) for few-shot learning. MCAN uses a novel architecture that learns to abstract high-level concepts from low-level multimodal features. It employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that identifies salient features across modalities and combines them into abstract concept representations. These abstract concepts are then used as a basis for few-shot learning tasks. MCAN includes a meta-learning component that learns how to quickly adapt these abstract concepts to new tasks. We also implement a cross-modal consistency module that ensures the abstracted concepts are coherent across different modalities. Additionally, we develop a conceptual memory bank that stores and retrieves abstract concepts, allowing the model to leverage past experiences for new tasks.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MCAN on a range of multimodal few-shot learning tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, multimodal classification, and multimodal generation. We will create a new benchmark dataset, MultiModalFewShot, that includes diverse concepts spanning text, image, and audio modalities. Metrics will include few-shot classification accuracy, retrieval performance, and generation quality. We will compare MCAN against traditional few-shot learning methods and large pre-trained multimodal models. We will also conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of MCAN, such as the hierarchical attention mechanism and the conceptual memory bank."

            "Multimodal Semantic Decomposition": {
                "Problem": "Current multimodal models often struggle to break down complex scenes or tasks into meaningful semantic components across modalities.",
                "Existing Work": "Most approaches focus on end-to-end learning or simple fusion of modalities without explicit semantic decomposition.",
                "Motivation": "Decomposing multimodal inputs into semantic units could enable more interpretable and generalizable reasoning across modalities.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel framework for Multimodal Semantic Decomposition (MSD) that jointly learns to segment visual scenes, parse natural language, and identify cross-modal semantic alignments. The core idea is to train a transformer-based model to generate a hierarchical graph representation of the semantic content in each modality, then align and fuse these graphs. For example, given an image and caption, MSD would produce visual object/region nodes, textual entity/relation nodes, and edges connecting related concepts across modalities. This semantic graph could then be used for downstream tasks like visual question answering or robotic instruction following. We introduce new pretraining objectives to encourage meaningful decompositions, such as cross-modal contrastive learning between graph nodes.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MSD on standard vision-language benchmarks like VQA and NLVR2, as well as introducing a new Semantic Decomposition Quality dataset with human-annotated graph alignments. We hypothesize that MSD will outperform end-to-end baselines, especially on complex reasoning tasks and out-of-distribution generalization."

                "Existing Work": "Current methods often use supervised learning on paired language-action data or reward-based reinforcement learning in constrained settings.",
                "Motivation": "Enabling robots to autonomously explore and learn language groundings could lead to more robust and generalizable embodied AI systems.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel framework for Curiosity-Driven Embodied Language Grounding (CDELG) that combines intrinsic motivation, active learning, and multimodal representation learning. A robot equipped with cameras and other sensors would autonomously explore its environment, guided by a curiosity signal based on prediction errors across modalities. As it interacts with objects and observes effects, it would generate natural language descriptions and questions about its experiences. A language model would then attempt to answer these questions, with mismatches driving further exploration. Through this process, the system would incrementally build a grounded lexicon and action repertoire, learning to associate words with sensory experiences, physical properties, and action outcomes.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will deploy CDELG on a real robot in a home-like environment and evaluate its ability to learn groundings for a wide range of words and concepts over extended periods. We'll compare against baselines trained on static datasets, hypothesizing that CDELG will show superior generalization to novel objects and situations. We'll also conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different curiosity formulations and active learning strategies."

                "Motivation": "Enabling AI systems to reason about cross-modal counterfactuals could greatly enhance their understanding of causal relationships in the world and improve performance on tasks requiring imagination or hypothetical reasoning.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a novel framework for Cross-Modal Counterfactual Reasoning (CMCR) that learns to generate and evaluate counterfactuals spanning multiple modalities. The core idea is to train a model to perform 'imaginative edits' on multimodal inputs and reason about their consequences. For example, given an image of a traffic scene and a textual description, CMCR could generate counterfactuals like 'If the traffic light were green instead of red, the cars would be moving' and visualize the corresponding scene. This requires learning a causal model of the world that can be manipulated across modalities. We propose new architectures combining graph neural networks for representing causal structure with generative models for each modality, along with novel training objectives for counterfactual consistency.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CMCR on a new benchmark we're creating called MultiModal Counterfactual Reasoning (MMCR), featuring paired real and counterfactual samples across vision, language, and simulated physics. We'll assess the plausibility and consistency of generated counterfactuals, as well as performance on downstream tasks like visual question answering with counterfactual questions. We hypothesize that CMCR will outperform baselines that don't explicitly model cross-modal causal structure, especially on questions requiring multi-step causal reasoning."

                "Existing Work": "Most methods use predefined templates or manual prompt engineering for multimodal few-shot learning.",
                "Motivation": "Developing adaptive prompting strategies that can automatically adjust to different multimodal tasks and data characteristics could significantly improve few-shot learning performance and generalization.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose Adaptive Multimodal Prompting (AMP), a novel framework for dynamically generating task-specific prompts for few-shot learning across multiple modalities. AMP uses a meta-learning approach to train a prompt generator network that takes as input a small set of labeled examples for a new task and outputs an optimal prompting strategy. This includes selecting relevant modalities, generating modality-specific prompt templates, and determining the best way to combine information across modalities. The prompt generator is trained end-to-end with a multimodal transformer model on a diverse set of tasks, learning to produce prompts that maximize few-shot performance. We introduce new techniques for handling variable numbers and types of modalities, as well as a prompt diversity regularizer to encourage exploration of different prompting strategies.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate AMP on a wide range of multimodal few-shot tasks, including vision-language understanding, audio-visual event detection, and multimodal sentiment analysis. We'll compare against fixed prompting baselines and other adaptive methods, hypothesizing that AMP will show superior few-shot performance and better generalization to unseen tasks. We'll also conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of the prompt generator architecture."

                "Proposed Study": "We propose a framework for Multimodal Analogical Reasoning for Robots (MARR) that learns to identify and apply analogies between tasks across visual, linguistic, and kinesthetic modalities. The core idea is to train a model to extract abstract relational structures from demonstrations of known tasks and use these to guide learning of new tasks. For example, given a demonstration of pouring water into a cup, MARR would identify key components like 'container', 'contents', and 'recipient', allowing it to transfer this knowledge to novel tasks like scooping flour or dispensing oil. We introduce new neural architectures for learning cross-modal relational embeddings and a novel analogy-guided policy optimization algorithm. MARR also incorporates natural language interaction, allowing users to guide the analogy process through verbal explanations and clarifications.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate MARR on a custom robotic task learning benchmark featuring families of related tasks with varying objects and goals. We'll measure sample efficiency in learning new tasks, as well as generalization to novel task variants. We hypothesize that MARR will significantly outperform baselines that don't use explicit analogical reasoning, especially in low-data regimes and on tasks requiring abstract knowledge transfer. We'll also conduct human studies to assess the intuitiveness and effectiveness of the natural language interaction for guiding analogies."

                "Motivation": "Humans can easily transfer concepts learned in one modality to another, such as recognizing a 'round' object visually after only hearing the word described. Enabling AI systems to perform similar cross-modal concept bridging could greatly enhance their generalization capabilities.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel framework for Cross-Modal Concept Bridging (CMCB) that actively learns to map concepts between different modalities. The core idea is to train a neural 'concept translator' network that takes as input a concept representation from one modality (e.g., text) and generates corresponding concept representations in other modalities (e.g., visual features, audio patterns). This translator is trained on a large dataset of aligned multimodal data, learning to map between modality-specific concept spaces. During inference, when presented with a new concept in one modality, the model can use the translator to 'imagine' how that concept might be represented in other modalities, even if it has never directly observed it in those modalities before.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CMCB on a range of cross-modal transfer tasks, including zero-shot image classification based on textual descriptions, audio event detection from visual cues, and robotic task execution from natural language instructions. We will compare against baselines such as multimodal transformers and cross-modal contrastive learning approaches. Key metrics will include transfer accuracy, generalization to unseen concepts, and qualitative analysis of the generated cross-modal representations."

TMCM employs a hierarchical structure with three key components: (1) Modality-specific temporal encoders that capture low-level temporal patterns within each modality, (2) A cross-modal temporal attention mechanism that aligns and fuses information across modalities at different time scales, and (3) A high-level causal reasoning module that infers and maintains a structured representation of causal relationships between events across modalities and time. This architecture allows the model to not only understand the current multimodal state but also predict future states and reason about the underlying causal structure of complex scenarios.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate TMCM on a variety of temporal multimodal tasks, including video question answering, multimodal event prediction, and robotic action planning based on multimodal demonstrations. We will create a new benchmark dataset that specifically tests for temporal coherence and causal understanding across modalities. Performance will be compared against state-of-the-art multimodal transformers and temporal modeling approaches, with metrics focusing on temporal accuracy, causal reasoning capabilities, and generalization to novel scenarios."

Mimicking this capability in AI systems could greatly enhance their reliability and safety in real-world applications.",

MARMS consists of three key components: (1) A multimodal consistency checker that identifies discrepancies between information from different modalities, (2) A cross-modal information recovery module that attempts to 'fill in' or 'correct' potentially corrupted information in one modality using information from others, and (3) A dynamic modality weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of each modality based on their estimated reliability and consistency with other modalities. During training, MARMS is exposed to a wide range of adversarial attacks across different modalities, learning to leverage the synergy between modalities to maintain robust performance even when individual modalities are compromised.",

We will create a comprehensive suite of multimodal adversarial attacks, including unimodal perturbations, cross-modal inconsistencies, and adaptive attacks that target the fusion process. Performance will be measured in terms of accuracy under various attack scenarios, with comparisons to unimodal robust models and existing multimodal fusion approaches.

GLAIM combines three key elements: (1) A curiosity-driven exploration module that encourages the robot to interact with its environment in diverse ways, (2) A self-supervised multimodal representation learning system that builds associations between sensorimotor experiences and language, and (3) An active learning component that generates linguistic hypotheses and designs 'experiments' to test them through interaction. The robot starts with no prior knowledge of language, but gradually builds its understanding by correlating its actions and sensory inputs with any language it encounters (e.g., from human narration or text in the environment). The system is driven by intrinsic rewards based on prediction error and information gain, motivating it to explore scenarios that are likely to improve its language understanding.",

MARZTA consists of three main components: (1) A large-scale multimodal knowledge base that encodes diverse tasks and their solutions across different modalities, (2) An analogical reasoning engine that identifies structural similarities between known tasks and new ones, even across modalities, and (3) A dynamic task mapping module that translates solutions from known tasks to the new domain. When faced with a new task, MARZTA first encodes it into a abstract task representation. It then searches its knowledge base for structurally similar tasks, potentially from different modalities. Once the most relevant analogies are identified, the system maps the solution strategies from the known tasks to the new domain, potentially combining elements from multiple analogies. This process allows the system to generate plausible solution strategies for entirely novel multimodal tasks.",

We will create a benchmark dataset of paired tasks with structural similarities but surface-level differences across modalities. Performance will be measured in terms of task completion success, solution quality, and the plausibility of the analogical mappings used. We will compare against state-of-the-art few-shot learning and meta-learning approaches, with a focus on scenarios where no examples from the target task are available."
