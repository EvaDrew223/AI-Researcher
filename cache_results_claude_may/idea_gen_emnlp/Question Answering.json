                "Problem": "Current question answering systems often struggle to identify the most relevant information from large contexts, leading to inaccurate or irrelevant answers.",
                "Existing Work": "Traditional approaches often use keyword matching or simple relevance scoring methods to identify relevant passages.",
                "Motivation": "By developing a more sophisticated contextual relevance ranking system, we can improve the accuracy and relevance of answers by better identifying the most pertinent information within large contexts.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel neural architecture that combines transformer-based language models with graph neural networks to capture both semantic and structural relationships within the context. The model will learn to rank passages based on their relevance to the question, considering factors such as semantic similarity, contextual coherence, and information density. We'll introduce a multi-stage ranking process where an initial coarse-grained ranking is followed by a fine-grained re-ranking, allowing for efficient processing of large contexts. Additionally, we'll incorporate a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on different aspects of the question when assessing the relevance of each passage.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on large-scale QA datasets such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA, comparing it against state-of-the-art baselines. We'll measure performance using standard QA metrics like Exact Match and F1 score, as well as introducing new metrics to assess the relevance and coherence of selected passages. We'll also conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component in our proposed architecture."

                "Problem": "Many real-world questions require understanding and reasoning across multiple modalities, such as text and images, which current QA systems struggle with.",
                "Existing Work": "Existing multi-modal QA systems often treat visual and textual information separately or use simple fusion techniques.",
                "Motivation": "By developing a more integrated approach to multi-modal reasoning, we can create QA systems that more closely mimic human-like understanding and reasoning across different types of information.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel architecture that uses a cross-modal transformer to jointly encode and reason over textual and visual information. Our model will include a visual reasoning module that can perform operations like object detection, attribute recognition, and spatial relationship inference. We'll introduce a new attention mechanism that allows the model to dynamically focus on different parts of the image and text based on the question. Additionally, we'll develop a multi-step reasoning process that generates intermediate visual and textual representations, allowing for more complex reasoning paths. To handle the diversity of question types, we'll implement a meta-learning approach that allows the model to adapt its reasoning strategy based on the question type.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on multi-modal QA datasets such as VQA, GQA, and TextVQA. We'll compare against state-of-the-art multi-modal QA systems and conduct human evaluations to assess the quality and interpretability of the answers. We'll also create a new benchmark dataset that specifically tests for complex reasoning across modalities. Ablation studies will be performed to understand the contribution of each component in our architecture."

                "Problem": "Open-domain question answering systems often struggle with integrating and reasoning over large amounts of diverse knowledge.",
                "Existing Work": "Current approaches typically rely on static knowledge bases or retrieve relevant documents independently for each question.",
                "Motivation": "By dynamically constructing and updating knowledge graphs specific to each question, we can enable more flexible and powerful reasoning capabilities for open-domain QA.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel system that dynamically constructs and refines a knowledge graph for each question. The system will start by retrieving relevant documents and extracting key entities and relationships. It will then use a graph neural network to reason over this initial graph, identifying missing information or inconsistencies. Based on this analysis, it will iteratively expand and refine the graph by retrieving additional information or asking clarifying questions. We'll develop new graph operations that allow for merging conflicting information, resolving coreferences across documents, and inferring implicit relationships. The final answer will be generated using a graph-to-text model that can explain its reasoning process by referencing the constructed knowledge graph.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our system on open-domain QA datasets such as Natural Questions and HotpotQA, as well as multi-hop reasoning datasets like ComplexWebQuestions. We'll compare against state-of-the-art open-domain QA systems and assess not only answer accuracy but also the quality and relevance of the constructed knowledge graphs. We'll conduct user studies to evaluate the system's ability to ask meaningful clarifying questions and provide interpretable explanations. Ablation studies will be performed to understand the impact of different components in our dynamic graph construction and reasoning process."

                "Problem": "Current QA systems often perform well on standard benchmarks but fail when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution questions.",
                "Existing Work": "Most work on adversarial QA focuses on manually crafted adversarial examples or simple perturbation techniques.",
                "Motivation": "By developing more sophisticated adversarial question generation techniques, we can create more robust QA systems that can handle a wider range of question types and linguistic variations.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel adversarial question generation framework that uses a combination of large language models and reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions. Our system will learn to identify weaknesses in target QA models and generate questions that exploit these weaknesses. We'll introduce a multi-agent setup where one agent generates questions and another tries to answer them, with both agents evolving over time. We'll develop new techniques for generating questions that require complex reasoning, involve subtle linguistic tricks, or target specific failure modes of QA systems. Additionally, we'll create a method for automatically evaluating the difficulty and validity of generated questions, ensuring that they remain answerable by humans.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will use our framework to generate large-scale adversarial datasets for popular QA benchmarks like SQuAD and Natural Questions. We'll evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art QA systems on these adversarial datasets and analyze the types of questions that are most challenging. We'll then use these adversarial examples to fine-tune QA models and assess their improved robustness. Human evaluations will be conducted to ensure the quality and fairness of the generated questions. We'll also investigate whether the insights gained from our adversarial generation process can be used to improve QA model architectures themselves."

                "Problem": "QA systems often struggle to update their knowledge and adapt to new information over time, leading to outdated or incorrect answers.",
                "Existing Work": "Most QA systems are trained on static datasets and require full retraining to incorporate new knowledge.",
                "Motivation": "By developing continual learning techniques for QA systems, we can create more adaptable models that can efficiently update their knowledge and reasoning capabilities over time.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel continual learning framework for QA systems that can incrementally update its knowledge and adapt to new information without forgetting previously learned skills. Our system will use a combination of memory replay, knowledge distillation, and meta-learning techniques to efficiently incorporate new information. We'll develop a dynamic knowledge base that can be updated in real-time as new facts or events occur. To handle conflicting or evolving information, we'll introduce a uncertainty-aware answering mechanism that can express different levels of confidence and provide multiple perspectives when appropriate. Additionally, we'll create a self-reflection module that allows the model to identify areas where its knowledge is outdated or inconsistent, triggering targeted updates.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will create a new benchmark dataset that simulates a stream of evolving knowledge over time, including updates to facts, emergence of new entities, and changes in relationships. We'll evaluate our continual learning QA system against traditional QA models that are periodically retrained, measuring both the accuracy of answers and the efficiency of the update process. We'll conduct longitudinal studies to assess how well the system maintains performance on older questions while adapting to new information. We'll also evaluate the system's ability to handle ambiguous or conflicting information by comparing its responses to human judgments in such scenarios."

                "Problem": "Complex questions often require multiple steps of reasoning or information retrieval, which current QA systems struggle with.",
                "Existing Work": "Prior approaches have explored question decomposition for multi-hop reasoning, but often in a static, predefined manner.",
                "Motivation": "A more dynamic, interactive approach to question decomposition could better handle the nuances of complex queries and allow for real-time clarification and refinement.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a conversational question decomposition framework for QA systems. The system will engage in a brief dialogue with the user to break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. It will use a combination of natural language understanding techniques and a decision tree-like structure to guide the decomposition process. The framework will also incorporate a mechanism to merge the answers to sub-questions into a coherent final response. This approach aims to improve accuracy on complex queries while providing a more interactive and transparent QA experience.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the system on existing multi-hop QA datasets like HotpotQA and ComplexWebQuestions, as well as a new dataset we'll create specifically for conversational question decomposition. We'll measure improvements in answer accuracy, relevance of sub-questions, and user satisfaction compared to baseline QA systems without decomposition. We'll also conduct user studies to assess the perceived helpfulness and naturalness of the conversational decomposition process."

                "Problem": "Most QA systems are limited to monolingual settings, restricting access to information across language barriers.",
                "Existing Work": "Current approaches often rely on machine translation of questions or answers, which can introduce errors and lose nuance.",
                "Motivation": "A system that can synthesize answers from multiple language sources could provide more comprehensive and accurate responses, especially for questions about topics with rich information in non-English languages.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a cross-lingual answer synthesis framework for QA. The system will simultaneously query multiple language-specific knowledge bases or search engines. It will then use a novel multi-lingual transformer architecture to align and synthesize information from these diverse sources. The model will be trained to identify and resolve conflicts between sources, consider cultural context, and generate a cohesive answer in the user's preferred language. We'll also incorporate a citation mechanism to provide transparency about the language and source of each piece of information.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will create a new multilingual QA dataset covering topics with significant information disparity across languages. We'll evaluate our system against baseline approaches (e.g., translate-then-answer) on metrics including answer accuracy, information completeness, and source diversity. We'll also conduct human evaluations to assess the quality and coherence of synthesized answers."
            },
            "Temporal-Aware Question Answering": {
                "Problem": "Many questions are implicitly or explicitly time-sensitive, but current QA systems often struggle to account for temporal context and changes in information over time.",
                "Existing Work": "Some research has explored time-aware knowledge graphs, but integration with QA systems remains limited.",
                "Motivation": "A QA system that explicitly models and reasons about temporal aspects could provide more accurate and nuanced answers, especially for questions about evolving topics or historical events.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a temporal-aware QA framework that incorporates time as a core dimension in both question understanding and answer generation. The system will use a novel time-sensitive attention mechanism to weigh information based on its temporal relevance. It will also employ a dynamic knowledge update module to track changes in facts over time. For ambiguous questions, the system will infer the most likely temporal context or ask for clarification. Additionally, we'll develop techniques to generate answers that explicitly acknowledge temporal uncertainty or changes in information.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will create a new dataset of time-sensitive questions across various domains (e.g., history, current events, science). We'll evaluate our system against standard QA models on metrics including temporal accuracy, relevance, and ability to handle ambiguous temporal contexts. We'll also assess the system's performance on existing datasets like TempQuestions and Time-Sensitive QA, focusing on improvements in handling temporal aspects of questions and answers."

                "Problem": "Current QA systems often provide answers with unwarranted confidence, leading to potential misinformation when the system is uncertain or lacks sufficient information.",
                "Existing Work": "Some research has explored confidence estimation in QA, but these approaches often struggle with calibration and interpretability.",
                "Motivation": "A QA system that can accurately assess and communicate its own uncertainty could greatly enhance trust and usability, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare or legal applications.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose an uncertainty-calibrated QA framework that provides not just answers, but also well-calibrated confidence estimates and explanations of uncertainty sources. The system will use a multi-headed architecture to generate answers along with uncertainty scores across different dimensions (e.g., factual certainty, semantic ambiguity, temporal uncertainty). We'll develop novel calibration techniques specifically designed for the QA context, incorporating factors like question complexity, answer source reliability, and potential for multiple valid interpretations. The system will also generate natural language explanations of its uncertainty, and in cases of high uncertainty, suggest ways to rephrase or clarify the question.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our system on existing QA datasets, augmented with human-annotated uncertainty labels. We'll measure calibration using metrics like Expected Calibration Error, as well as the quality and usefulness of uncertainty explanations through human evaluation. We'll also create a new test set of intentionally ambiguous or unanswerable questions to assess the system's ability to recognize and communicate uncertainty in challenging cases."

            "Adversarial-Robust Question Answering": {
                "Problem": "QA systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight modifications to questions can lead to drastically different or incorrect answers.",
                "Existing Work": "Previous research has focused on generating adversarial examples or training models on adversarial data, but often with limited generalization to diverse attack types.",
                "Motivation": "Developing QA systems that are robust to a wide range of potential adversarial manipulations is crucial for deploying these systems in real-world, potentially adversarial environments.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose an adversarial-robust QA framework that combines proactive and reactive defense mechanisms. The system will employ a novel question preprocessing module that detects and neutralizes potential adversarial perturbations, using techniques inspired by adversarial example detection in computer vision. We'll also develop a dynamic answer verification component that generates and tests multiple variations of the question to ensure consistency. The framework will incorporate a continual learning mechanism to adapt to new types of adversarial attacks over time. Additionally, we'll explore the use of adversarial training techniques specifically designed for the nuances of natural language QA.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our system against a diverse set of adversarial attacks, including subtle semantic manipulations, syntactic perturbations, and context-shifting attacks. We'll measure robustness in terms of answer consistency and accuracy under attack, compared to standard QA models. We'll also assess the system's false positive rate on non-adversarial questions to ensure that the robustness mechanisms don't overly constrain performance on normal inputs. Finally, we'll conduct a simulated deployment study to evaluate the system's ability to adapt to evolving adversarial strategies over time."

            "Recursive Question Decomposition": {
                "Problem": "Complex questions often require multiple steps of reasoning and information retrieval, which current QA systems struggle with.",
                "Existing Work": "Previous approaches like Chain-of-Thought prompting have attempted to break down reasoning into steps, but often in a linear fashion.",
                "Motivation": "Inspired by divide-and-conquer algorithms, we can recursively break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions, potentially creating a tree-like structure of interdependent queries.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a Recursive Question Decomposition (RQD) framework where an LLM is prompted to: 1) Analyze a complex question, 2) Decompose it into simpler sub-questions if necessary, 3) Recursively apply this process to sub-questions until reaching 'atomic' questions, 4) Answer atomic questions, and 5) Synthesize answers back up the decomposition tree. This approach allows for handling nested dependencies and parallel sub-problems more effectively than linear decompositions.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will create a dataset of complex, multi-step questions across various domains. We'll compare RQD against baseline methods like standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought, and non-recursive decomposition approaches. Evaluation metrics will include overall accuracy, as well as intermediate metrics assessing the quality and efficiency of the decomposition process."

            "Contrastive Answer Generation": {
                "Problem": "QA systems often struggle to differentiate between similar but distinct concepts, leading to ambiguous or incorrect answers.",
                "Existing Work": "Current approaches typically focus on generating a single best answer, sometimes with confidence scores.",
                "Motivation": "Humans often understand concepts better by comparing and contrasting them with similar ideas. We can leverage this principle to improve QA systems.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce Contrastive Answer Generation (CAG), where the QA system is prompted to generate not just the correct answer, but also closely related incorrect answers along with explanations of the differences. For example, given the question 'What is the capital of Australia?', CAG would generate: 1) Correct: Canberra, 2) Incorrect but related: Sydney (largest city, but not the capital), Melbourne (second-largest city, former temporary capital). This approach forces the model to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter and provides more informative outputs.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CAG on existing QA datasets, modifying them to include questions where contrastive answers are particularly informative. We'll assess not only the correctness of the primary answer but also the relevance and accuracy of the contrastive answers and explanations. Human evaluators will rate the overall informativeness and clarity of the outputs compared to standard QA approaches."

            "Temporal Consistency Tracking": {
                "Problem": "QA systems often provide inconsistent answers to time-sensitive questions asked at different points, failing to account for changing real-world information.",
                "Existing Work": "Most current QA systems rely on static knowledge bases or training data, with some attempts at using external APIs for real-time information.",
                "Motivation": "We need a systematic approach to track and update temporal information within the QA system itself, ensuring consistency and accuracy over time.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose Temporal Consistency Tracking (TCT), a framework that maintains a dynamic knowledge graph of time-sensitive information. When answering questions, TCT not only provides the answer but also timestamps it and estimates its 'expiration date'. For rapidly changing topics, it can set up automated update triggers. When a question is asked about a previously queried topic, TCT checks if the information is still valid, and if not, it initiates an update process. This could involve prompting the LLM with recent news articles or other fresh data sources to revise its knowledge.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will create a dataset of time-sensitive questions asked at various intervals (days, weeks, months apart). We'll compare TCT against standard QA systems and those using external real-time APIs. Evaluation will focus on answer consistency over time, accuracy with respect to real-world changes, and the system's ability to recognize and update outdated information."

            "Multi-Perspective Answer Synthesis": {
                "Problem": "Many questions, especially in domains like history, politics, or ethics, have multiple valid perspectives or interpretations, which current QA systems struggle to represent.",
                "Existing Work": "Existing QA systems typically aim for a single 'correct' answer, sometimes with confidence scores or supporting evidence.",
                "Motivation": "To provide more comprehensive and nuanced answers, especially for complex or controversial topics, we need a system that can synthesize multiple viewpoints.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose Multi-Perspective Answer Synthesis (MPAS), a framework that generates answers from multiple viewpoints or schools of thought. Given a question, MPAS will: 1) Identify relevant perspectives or stakeholders, 2) Generate answers from each perspective, 3) Synthesize a summary that highlights agreements, disagreements, and nuances across perspectives. For example, for the question 'Was the Industrial Revolution positive for society?', MPAS would provide economic, social, environmental, and historical perspectives before synthesizing an overall answer.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will curate a dataset of questions from fields known for multiple valid interpretations (e.g., history, ethics, social sciences). Evaluation will involve both quantitative metrics (e.g., diversity of perspectives, factual accuracy) and qualitative assessment by domain experts on the comprehensiveness and fairness of the multi-perspective answers compared to standard QA outputs."

                "Problem": "QA systems often struggle with abstract or conceptual questions that require drawing parallels between seemingly unrelated domains.",
                "Existing Work": "Current approaches mostly rely on direct pattern matching or semantic similarity in the knowledge base.",
                "Motivation": "Humans often understand and explain abstract concepts through analogies. Incorporating this cognitive process into QA systems could greatly enhance their ability to handle abstract reasoning tasks.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce Analogical Reasoning for Abstract QA (ARAQA), a system that leverages analogies to answer abstract questions. Given an abstract question, ARAQA will: 1) Identify the core concept or relationship, 2) Search for analogous situations in different domains, 3) Map the relationships from the familiar domain to the abstract one, 4) Generate an answer that explains the abstract concept through the analogy. For instance, to answer 'How does a blockchain work?', ARAQA might use an analogy of a public ledger in a small town where everyone can see and verify transactions.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will create a dataset of abstract questions across various domains (e.g., technology, science, philosophy). We'll compare ARAQA against standard QA systems and those specifically designed for abstract reasoning. Evaluation will focus on the relevance and clarity of the analogies, the accuracy of the final answers, and human ratings of how well the analogies aided understanding of the abstract concepts."
