                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel framework that integrates dynamic network analysis with contextual language models to track the spread of cultural memes and ideas. Our method will construct evolving social networks from social media data, where nodes represent users and edges represent interactions. We'll use transformer-based language models fine-tuned on cultural domain knowledge to extract and classify cultural concepts from user-generated content. The diffusion of these concepts will be modeled as information flow through the network, accounting for user attributes, network structure, and temporal dynamics. We'll develop new metrics to quantify the 'cultural influence' of nodes and identify critical paths of idea transmission.",

We'll develop a 'cultural style encoder' that can extract and represent the distinctive features of different cultural traditions. The generative model will be trained to combine these cultural style vectors in innovative ways, guided by a 'cultural plausibility' discriminator.

These sentiment vectors will then be modeled as trajectories in a high-dimensional space using techniques from dynamical systems theory, such as phase space reconstruction and Lyapunov exponents. This will allow us to identify patterns, bifurcations, and attractor states in cultural sentiment evolution, providing a more nuanced understanding of cultural dynamics.",
