            "Hierarchical Abstractive Summarization": {
                "Problem": "Current summarization models often struggle with long documents and maintaining coherence across different levels of abstraction.",
                "Existing Work": "Most existing summarization approaches focus on either extractive or abstractive methods, with some recent work on hybrid models.",
                "Motivation": "Humans typically summarize long documents by first creating high-level outlines and then expanding on key points. We can mimic this process to create more coherent and structured summaries.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel hierarchical abstractive summarization method that operates in two stages. First, a high-level outline generator creates a structured skeleton of the document's main points. Then, a detail expander model elaborates on each outline point to produce the final summary. Both models will be based on transformer architectures but with special attention mechanisms to focus on document structure and maintain consistency across levels. The outline generator will use a graph-based attention mechanism to capture relationships between different sections of the document, while the detail expander will employ a hierarchical attention mechanism to ensure coherence between the outline and expanded details.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on long-form document summarization datasets such as arXiv, PubMed, and Longsumm. Baselines will include state-of-the-art abstractive and extractive summarization models. We will use ROUGE scores, BERTScore, and human evaluation to assess summary quality, coherence, and faithfulness to the original document. We hypothesize that our hierarchical approach will outperform baselines, especially on longer documents and in terms of overall coherence and structure."

                "Problem": "Current text summarization models often ignore valuable contextual information from other modalities, leading to less informative or potentially misleading summaries.",
                "Existing Work": "Most summarization research focuses solely on text input, with some recent work on multi-modal summarization for specific domains like news articles with images.",
                "Motivation": "Many real-world documents exist in rich multi-modal contexts (e.g., scientific papers with figures, social media posts with images and user profiles). Incorporating this additional context can lead to more accurate and informative summaries.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a multi-modal context-aware summarization framework that integrates text, images, metadata, and relational information. Our model will use a novel cross-modal attention mechanism to fuse information from different modalities. For text, we'll use a transformer-based encoder. For images, we'll use a vision transformer. Metadata and relational information will be encoded using graph neural networks. The decoder will be a transformer with multi-head attention over all encoded modalities. We'll also introduce a modality importance predictor that dynamically weights the contribution of each modality based on the input, allowing the model to adapt to different types of documents and contexts.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will create a new multi-modal summarization dataset by augmenting existing text summarization datasets (e.g., CNN/DailyMail, arXiv) with related images, metadata, and relational information. We'll compare our model against text-only baselines and simpler multi-modal approaches. Evaluation metrics will include ROUGE, BERTScore, and a new metric we'll develop to assess multi-modal coherence. We'll also conduct human evaluations to assess the informativeness and accuracy of the summaries with respect to all available contextual information."

                "Existing Work": "Some research has explored controllable summarization with length as a parameter, but these models often struggle with maintaining coherence and completeness at different lengths.",
                "Motivation": "Different documents and use cases require summaries of varying lengths. A flexible summarization system that can dynamically adapt its output length while maintaining coherence and completeness would be highly valuable.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel dynamic length-adaptive summarization model that can generate coherent summaries of any desired length. Our model will use a transformer-based architecture with a special length-aware attention mechanism. During training, we'll use a curriculum learning approach, gradually increasing the difficulty of length adaptation tasks. We'll introduce a new loss function that balances information coverage, coherence, and length adherence. Additionally, we'll develop a length prediction module that can suggest an optimal summary length based on the input document and user preferences. To handle extreme length requirements, we'll incorporate a hierarchical summarization structure that can expand or collapse different levels of detail as needed.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We'll evaluate our model on standard summarization datasets (CNN/DailyMail, XSum) as well as a new dataset we'll create with human-written summaries of various lengths for each document. Baselines will include fixed-length summarization models and existing controllable summarization approaches. We'll assess performance using ROUGE scores, BERTScore, and a new metric for measuring information density at different summary lengths. Human evaluation will focus on coherence and completeness across different length requirements. We hypothesize that our model will outperform baselines, especially when generating summaries at lengths significantly different from the training data."

                "Existing Work": "Most summarization research focuses on generating a single, consensus summary. Some work has been done on multi-document summarization, but it typically doesn't explicitly model conflicting viewpoints.",
                "Motivation": "For many topics, especially in news and social media, it's crucial to present a balanced view of different opinions. A summarization system that can identify, contrast, and succinctly present diverse viewpoints would be valuable for promoting informed discourse.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a contrastive opinion summarization model that explicitly identifies and summarizes different viewpoints on a topic. Our model will use a multi-stage approach: First, an opinion clustering module will identify distinct viewpoints in the input documents using a combination of topic modeling and stance detection. Then, a viewpoint-aware summarization module will generate concise summaries for each identified viewpoint. Finally, a contrast generation module will produce a final summary that highlights the key differences and similarities between the viewpoints. We'll introduce a novel contrastive attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on distinguishing features of each viewpoint. We'll also develop a fairness-aware loss function to ensure balanced representation of different opinions.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We'll create a new dataset of controversial topics from news articles and social media discussions, with human-annotated viewpoints and contrastive summaries. We'll compare our model against standard multi-document summarization baselines and opinion mining approaches.

                "Existing Work": "Most summarization research focuses on static documents or short time periods. Some work has been done on timeline summarization, but it often lacks the ability to capture complex topic evolution and relationships.",
                "Motivation": "Many important topics, such as ongoing news stories or scientific discoveries, evolve over time. A summarization system that can capture and present this evolution would provide valuable insights and context.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a temporal-aware evolving topic summarization model that can generate dynamic summaries of long-running events or discussions. Our model will use a novel temporal-relational transformer architecture that can process documents across different time periods and capture evolving relationships between subtopics. We'll introduce a dynamic topic modeling component that identifies and tracks subtopics over time. The summarization component will use a hierarchical approach, generating both high-level summaries of the overall topic evolution and detailed summaries of specific time periods or subtopics. We'll develop a new attention mechanism that can focus on both temporal proximity and topical relevance. Additionally, we'll create a visualization module that can present the evolving summary in an interactive timeline format.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We'll create a new dataset of long-running news stories and scientific topics, with human-written summaries at different time scales. We'll compare our model against static summarization baselines and existing timeline summarization approaches. Evaluation metrics will include ROUGE scores, a new metric for measuring temporal coherence and evolution capture, and human evaluation of the summaries' ability to convey topic evolution. We'll also evaluate the usefulness of the interactive visualization through user studies. We hypothesize that our model will provide more insightful and temporally coherent summaries for evolving topics compared to baselines."

                "Existing Work": "Most existing summarization approaches use fixed compression ratios or target lengths, which may not be optimal for all types of content.",
                "Motivation": "An adaptive approach that dynamically adjusts the level of compression based on the importance and complexity of the content could lead to more informative and contextually appropriate summaries.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel Adaptive Compression Summarization (ACS) model that learns to dynamically adjust its compression ratio based on the input document's characteristics. The model will incorporate a content importance estimator that assesses each segment of the input text and determines an appropriate level of detail to include in the summary. This estimator will be trained on a diverse corpus of documents and their human-written summaries of varying lengths. The ACS model will then use this importance estimation to guide a hierarchical summarization process, where it first generates a high-level summary and then expands on important points as needed. The model will also include a feedback mechanism that allows it to iteratively refine the summary based on coherence and information coverage metrics.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the ACS model against fixed-ratio summarization baselines on multiple datasets, including news articles, scientific papers, and long-form narratives. Metrics will include ROUGE scores, human evaluations of informativeness and coherence, and a novel metric we'll develop to assess the appropriateness of compression levels.

                "Existing Work": "Current cross-lingual summarization methods often focus on direct translation or alignment of word embeddings, which can lead to loss of important cultural or contextual information.",
                "Motivation": "A summarization approach that can preserve and translate key concepts across languages could greatly enhance cross-cultural communication and information sharing.",
                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a Cross-Lingual Concept-Preserving Summarization (CLCPS) model that combines advanced language understanding with cultural knowledge graphs. The model will first identify key concepts in the source document using a multilingual concept extractor trained on diverse corpora. It will then map these concepts to a language-agnostic representation using a novel cultural knowledge graph that captures relationships between concepts across different languages and cultures. The summarization process will use this concept map to generate a summary in the target language, ensuring that important ideas are preserved even when direct translations are not appropriate. The model will also incorporate a 'cultural explanation' module that can provide additional context for concepts that may be unfamiliar in the target language.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the CLCPS model on a new dataset we'll create, consisting of documents in multiple languages with expert-written summaries in various target languages. We'll compare our model against state-of-the-art cross-lingual summarization systems, using both automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore) and human evaluations focusing on concept preservation and cultural appropriateness.

                "Motivation": "A summarization model that can effectively capture and present multiple perspectives on a debate could enhance understanding of complex issues and promote more informed discourse.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a Multi-Perspective Debate Summarization (MPDS) model that aims to provide a balanced and comprehensive overview of debates. The model will first use an argument mining component to identify and classify different viewpoints and supporting evidence within the input text. It will then employ a novel 'perspective clustering' algorithm to group similar arguments and identify the main strands of thought in the debate. The summarization component will generate multiple mini-summaries, each representing a distinct perspective, along with a meta-summary that outlines the overall structure of the debate. The model will also include a 'fairness checker' that ensures equal representation of all major viewpoints, and a 'strength assessor' that evaluates the relative strength of arguments based on their evidence and logical consistency.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the MPDS model on a diverse set of debate transcripts, opinion pieces, and social media discussions. We'll create a new evaluation framework that assesses not only the quality of individual perspective summaries but also the overall balance and comprehensiveness of the multi-perspective summary. This will include metrics for viewpoint coverage, argument strength representation, and bias detection. We'll conduct user studies to evaluate how well the MPDS summaries help readers understand complex debates compared to traditional single-perspective summaries."

                "Proposed Study": "We introduce a Temporal-Causal Summarization (TCS) model that combines temporal reasoning with causal inference to generate structured summaries. The model will first construct a temporal-causal graph from the input text, using a novel neural architecture that jointly learns to identify events, their temporal ordering, and causal relationships. This graph will then be used to guide the summarization process, ensuring that the summary reflects the key causal chains and temporal progression of the original content. The model will also incorporate a 'narrative coherence' module that ensures the summary presents a logically consistent and temporally aligned account. Additionally, we'll develop a 'causal importance' estimator that helps prioritize which causal links to include in the summary based on their overall impact on the narrative.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the TCS model on a range of temporally and causally rich texts, including historical narratives, scientific explanations, and complex news stories. We'll develop new evaluation metrics that assess temporal coherence, causal fidelity, and narrative flow. We'll compare our model against traditional summarization baselines as well as recent timeline generation approaches. Human evaluations will focus on the model's ability to capture and convey the key temporal and causal aspects of the original text.

The base layer will provide a concise overview, with each key point linked to more detailed sub-summaries that users can reveal on demand. The system will use a hierarchical attention mechanism to organize information at different levels of detail. It will also incorporate a real-time query understanding module that allows users to ask follow-up questions or request expansions on specific points, dynamically generating relevant sub-summaries. The IES will include a 'coherence maintainer' that ensures smooth transitions between different levels of detail and a 'novelty tracker' that highlights new information as users explore deeper. Additionally, we'll develop a 'user interest model' that learns from interaction patterns to personalize the exploration experience over time.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the IES system through a series of user studies, assessing factors such as information gain, user engagement, and satisfaction compared to static summaries. We'll develop metrics to measure the system's responsiveness, the relevance of expanded content, and the coherence of the overall exploration experience. We'll also analyze exploration patterns to understand how users interact with the system and how this varies across different types of content. Long-term studies will evaluate how well the system adapts to individual users over time. Technical evaluations will assess the quality of generated sub-summaries and the system's ability to maintain global coherence across different levels of detail."

The system will first create an emotional profile for each user based on their reading history and explicit feedback. During summarization, the model will analyze the emotional content of the source text using advanced sentiment analysis techniques. It will then generate multiple summary versions, each emphasizing different emotional aspects. Finally, it will select or synthesize the summary that best aligns with the user's emotional profile, potentially even adapting the language style to match the user's preferences. This approach will use a combination of transformer-based models for sentiment analysis and summarization, reinforcement learning for personalization, and a novel emotional alignment scoring mechanism.",

The system will continuously crawl and index reputable news sources, academic databases, and fact-checking websites. During summarization, it will cross-reference claims against this constantly updating knowledge base. The summarization process will be a multi-step pipeline: 1) Initial summary generation using a state-of-the-art abstractive model. 2) Fact extraction and verification, where each claim is checked against multiple sources. 3) Confidence scoring for each fact based on source reliability and consensus. 4) Summary refinement, where low-confidence or conflicting information is either removed, flagged, or replaced with verified alternatives. 5) Source citation generation, providing transparency for each claim. This system will use a combination of NLP techniques including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and natural language inference, along with a novel fact consensus algorithm.",

The system will first use a combination of keyword extraction and topic modeling to identify the main concepts in the source text. It will then leverage a large knowledge base of common experiences and objects to generate potential analogies for each concept. The system will use a neural analogy scoring model to select the most appropriate and explanatory analogies. Finally, it will integrate these analogies into the summary, creating a hybrid output that combines factual information with illustrative comparisons. This approach will require developing a new dataset of concept-analogy pairs, training a transformer-based analogy generation model, and creating a novel integration algorithm that seamlessly blends factual summary with analogical explanations.",

It will then identify key decision points or assumptions using a combination of causal inference techniques and importance scoring. For each of these points, the system will generate plausible alternative scenarios, using a mix of rule-based and neural generation methods. These counterfactuals will be evaluated for plausibility and impact using a specially trained model. Finally, the system will integrate the most significant counterfactuals into an expanded summary, presenting a tree-like structure of potential outcomes.

It will then use a novel cross-modal attention mechanism to identify correlations and complementary information across modalities. The system will generate a textual summary that incorporates insights from all modalities, and additionally produce a multi-modal summary output that includes relevant images, video clips, or audio segments alongside the text. This approach will require developing new datasets for cross-modal information synthesis, creating a novel architecture for multi-modal attention and fusion, and designing new techniques for generating coherent multi-modal outputs.",
