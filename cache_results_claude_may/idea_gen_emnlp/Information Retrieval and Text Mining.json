            "Dynamic Query Expansion": {
                "Problem": "Traditional information retrieval systems often struggle with vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents, leading to suboptimal search results.",
                "Existing Work": "Static query expansion techniques and word embedding-based approaches have been used to address this issue, but they often lack context-awareness and adaptability.",
                "Motivation": "We can leverage the contextual understanding capabilities of large language models to dynamically expand queries based on the specific information need and the current state of the retrieval process.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel Dynamic Query Expansion (DQE) framework that uses a large language model as a query expansion agent. Given an initial query and the top-k retrieved documents, the LLM analyzes the content, identifies potential vocabulary gaps, and generates contextually relevant expansion terms. These terms are then used to reformulate the query for subsequent retrieval iterations. The LLM also maintains a 'conversation' with itself across iterations, refining its understanding of the information need and adjusting the expansion strategy accordingly. To ensure diversity and prevent topic drift, we implement a self-attention mechanism that allows the LLM to focus on different aspects of the information need in each iteration.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DQE against static query expansion methods and traditional relevance feedback approaches on standard IR datasets like TREC and MS MARCO. We'll measure performance using metrics such as Mean Average Precision (MAP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Time-Biased Gain (TBG). We'll also conduct a user study to assess the perceived relevance and diversity of results. Additionally, we'll analyze the generated expansion terms to gain insights into the LLM's reasoning process and its ability to capture nuanced information needs."

                "Existing Work": "While there has been work on multi-modal information retrieval, most approaches treat different modalities separately or use simple fusion techniques.",
                "Motivation": "By developing a unified framework that can seamlessly integrate and synthesize information across different modalities, we can unlock new insights and improve the overall quality of information extraction and retrieval.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a Cross-Modal Information Synthesis (CMIS) framework that uses a multi-modal transformer architecture to jointly process and analyze text, images, audio, and video. The key innovation is a novel cross-modal attention mechanism that allows each modality to attend to relevant information in other modalities. This mechanism is complemented by a modality-agnostic representation learning objective that encourages the model to create a unified semantic space. To handle the varying granularity of information across modalities, we introduce a hierarchical pooling strategy that can aggregate information at different levels (e.g., word, sentence, paragraph for text; frame, scene, video for visual data). The CMIS framework also includes a generative component that can produce coherent multi-modal summaries, combining textual descriptions with relevant visual or audio snippets.",
                "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CMIS on a range of cross-modal tasks, including multi-modal information retrieval, cross-modal summarization, and multi-modal question answering. We'll create a new benchmark dataset that combines existing resources like MS-COCO, AudioSet, and HowTo100M with additional annotations for cross-modal relationships. Performance will be measured using modality-specific metrics (e.g., BLEU, METEOR for text; SSIM, PSNR for images) as well as novel cross-modal coherence metrics. We'll also conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component of the CMIS framework."

                "Motivation": "By developing advanced techniques for mining and reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs, we can better capture the dynamic nature of real-world information and enable more accurate and timely information retrieval and analysis.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a Temporal Knowledge Graph Mining (TKGM) framework that combines neural-symbolic reasoning with advanced temporal logic to model and extract complex temporal patterns from large-scale text corpora. The framework consists of three main components: (1) A temporal information extraction module that uses a combination of transformer-based models and temporal logic rules to identify and normalize temporal expressions, events, and relationships in text. (2) A dynamic graph construction module that builds and continuously updates a temporal knowledge graph, using a novel graph neural network architecture that can handle time-stamped nodes and edges. (3) A temporal reasoning engine that can perform complex queries over the temporal knowledge graph, supporting operations like temporal inference, prediction, and anomaly detection. The reasoning engine uses a differentiable temporal logic formulation that allows it to seamlessly integrate with the neural components of the system.",

We'll create a new large-scale temporal knowledge graph dataset by augmenting existing KGs like Wikidata with fine-grained temporal information extracted from news articles and social media. Performance will be measured using standard KG completion metrics (e.g., Mean Reciprocal Rank, Hits@k) as well as new temporal-specific metrics that assess the accuracy of temporal ordering and duration estimation. We'll also conduct case studies in specific domains (e.g., tracking the evolution of scientific knowledge, analyzing geopolitical events) to demonstrate the practical value of the TKGM framework."

                "Proposed Study": "We propose an Adversarial Information Retrieval Robustness (AIRR) framework that combines adversarial training techniques with content-aware relevance modeling to create resilient retrieval systems. The framework consists of three main components: (1) An adversarial attack generator that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create realistic but malicious document modifications and query perturbations. This generator is trained to maximize the disruption of retrieval results while maintaining semantic similarity to the original content. (2) A robust ranking model that uses a novel attention mechanism to focus on salient and trustworthy parts of documents and queries, making it less susceptible to adversarial manipulations. This model is trained using a multi-task objective that combines relevance prediction with adversarial detection. (3) A meta-learning component that continuously adapts the retrieval model to new types of adversarial attacks, using a few-shot learning approach to quickly generalize from a small number of identified attack instances.",

We'll measure robustness using metrics like the drop in Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) under attack, as well as the system's ability to detect and mitigate adversarial content. We'll also conduct a large-scale online A/B test in collaboration with a commercial search engine to assess the real-world impact of AIRR in terms of user satisfaction and trust. Additionally, we'll perform an extensive analysis of the generated adversarial examples to gain insights into potential vulnerabilities in current IR systems and to inform future security measures."

                "Motivation": "By developing a federated framework for information extraction, we can enable collaborative learning across multiple data silos without compromising data privacy, potentially unlocking valuable insights from previously inaccessible data sources.",
                "Proposed Study": "We propose a Federated Information Extraction (FIE) framework that allows multiple organizations to collaboratively train advanced information extraction models without sharing raw data. The framework consists of four main components: (1) A local extraction module that uses a combination of transformer-based models and rule-based systems to perform initial entity and relation extraction on each organization's private data. (2) A federated model aggregation mechanism that uses secure multi-party computation to combine model updates from different organizations while preserving privacy. This mechanism includes a novel differential privacy scheme tailored for information extraction tasks.

We'll compare FIE against centralized training baselines and simpler federated learning approaches. Additionally, we'll conduct case studies in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, working with partner organizations to assess the real-world applicability and benefits of FIE in terms of knowledge discovery and privacy protection."

                "Proposed Study": "We propose a novel Contextual Relevance Scoring (CRS) framework that leverages large language models to dynamically assess document relevance. The CRS system will first generate a detailed query interpretation, including potential user intents and related concepts. It will then use this interpretation to guide a multi-stage document scoring process. For each candidate document, the system will generate a summary focused on query-related aspects, and then use the language model to produce a relevance score based on how well the document aligns with the interpreted query intent. This score will be combined with traditional IR metrics using a learned weighting scheme.",
