        "Adversarial Prompt Detector": {
            "Problem": "Large language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can manipulate them to generate harmful, biased, or false content. Detecting such adversarial prompts is crucial for improving the robustness and security of these models.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for detecting adversarial prompts include using classifiers trained on labeled datasets of adversarial and benign prompts, or using heuristics based on prompt characteristics such as length or presence of certain keywords.",
            "Motivation": "Instead of relying on fixed classifiers or heuristics, we can leverage the language understanding capabilities of LLMs themselves to detect adversarial prompts. By prompting LLMs to analyze and compare prompts, we can enable them to identify potential adversarial characteristics in a more flexible and generalizable way.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting approach for adversarial prompt detection. First, we prompt the LLM to generate a diverse set of adversarial prompts targeting itself, by providing instructions like 'Generate prompts that might manipulate an AI system to produce harmful outputs'. Next, we prompt the LLM to compare each generated adversarial prompt with the actual input prompt, and highlight any similarities in terms of tactics used, topics mentioned, or sentiment. Finally, we prompt the LLM to make a judgment on whether the input prompt is likely to be adversarial based on the comparison insights, using a question like 'Based on the similarities to known adversarial prompts, do you think the input prompt is likely to be adversarial? Explain your reasoning.'",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the adversarial prompt detector on datasets like RealToxicityPrompts and HarmlessQuestions that contain both adversarial and benign prompts. Compare with baseline classifiers and heuristics. Also test the detector's ability to generalize to adversarial prompts not seen during training."
        },
        "Debate-Based Robustness Training": {
            "Problem": "Adversarial prompts can often exploit biases or inconsistencies in an LLM's knowledge and beliefs. Improving an LLM's robustness requires identifying and resolving such biases and inconsistencies.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for robustness training of LLMs include adversarial training (training on adversarially perturbed prompts) and consistency training (encouraging consistent outputs for semantically similar prompts). However, these methods often require large labeled datasets.",
            "Motivation": "Debate and argumentation are powerful tools for exposing and reconciling conflicting beliefs and information. We can prompt LLMs to engage in self-debate to surface biases and inconsistencies in their own responses, and then use this self-feedback to improve robustness.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a debate-based approach for LLM robustness training. Given an input prompt, we first ask the LLM to generate a response. We then prompt the LLM to engage in a self-debate by generating an opposing view to its own response, poking holes and finding weaknesses. After several rounds of this self-debate, we prompt the LLM to reconcile the different views and generate a final response that is more robust and consistent. Throughout this process, we also prompt the LLM to reflect on any biases or inconsistencies exposed during the debate, and to update its beliefs and knowledge accordingly.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the debate-based training approach on various robustness benchmarks such as ANLI and Adversarial-NLI. Compare with baseline methods like adversarial training and consistency training, in terms of both robustness to adversarial attacks and sample efficiency. Also measure the biases and inconsistencies in the LLM's responses before and after debate-based training."
        },
        "Adaptive Safety Prompting": {
            "Problem": "Existing prompting techniques for improving LLM safety and robustness often rely on fixed, one-size-fits-all prompts. However, the effectiveness of such prompts may vary depending on the input context and the specific LLM being used.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for safe prompting include using hand-crafted prompts to steer LLM behavior, such as 'Let's have a thoughtful and respectful discussion', or 'I cannot engage with or produce harmful content'. There are also some adaptive prompting methods that use LLMs to generate prompts, but they are not specifically designed for safety and robustness.",
            "Motivation": "To improve the effectiveness and flexibility of safety prompting, we can dynamically generate prompts tailored to the input context and the target LLM. By leveraging LLMs' own language understanding and generation capabilities, we can create more natural and context-aware safety prompts.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose an adaptive safety prompting technique that works as follows. First, we prompt an LLM to analyze the input context and identify any potential safety or robustness risks (e.g., toxic language, misinformation, illegal activities). Based on the identified risks, we then prompt the LLM to generate a customized safety prompt that is relevant to the context and the target LLM. For example, if the input context is about medical advice, the generated prompt may emphasize the importance of consulting professional doctors and not spreading unverified treatments. Finally, we prepend the generated safety prompt to the input context when querying the target LLM.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate adaptive safety prompting on various benchmarks for LLM safety and robustness, such as RealToxicityPrompts, TruthfulQA, and SafetyBench. Compare with baseline methods that use fixed safety prompts. Also conduct human evaluations to assess the naturalness and coherence of the generated safety prompts."

        "Prompt Perturbation Augmentation": {
            "Problem": "Adversarial attacks on LLMs often involve crafting prompts with small perturbations that can significantly change the model's behavior. Improving LLM robustness requires training on a diverse set of perturbed prompts.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for data augmentation in NLP include techniques like word substitution, back-translation, and paraphrasing. However, these methods may not capture the full range of adversarial perturbations that can be made to prompts.",
            "Motivation": "We can leverage LLMs' own language generation capabilities to create diverse and realistic perturbations of input prompts. By training LLMs on these perturbed prompts, we can improve their robustness to a wider range of adversarial attacks.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a prompt perturbation augmentation method that works as follows. Given an input prompt, we first generate a set of perturbed versions of the prompt using various LLMs and prompting strategies. For example, we can use prompts like 'Paraphrase this sentence while preserving its meaning', 'Substitute some words in this sentence with their synonyms', or 'Translate this sentence to French and then back to English'. We can also use adversarial prompts like 'Subtly change this sentence to reverse its sentiment' to generate more challenging perturbations. We then train the target LLM on the original prompt and all the perturbed prompts, using techniques like adversarial training or consistency training.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate prompt perturbation augmentation on various robustness benchmarks such as ANLI, Adversarial-NLI, and PAWS. Compare with baseline data augmentation methods in terms of both robustness and data efficiency. Also analyze the diversity and quality of the generated perturbed prompts."
        },
        "Rationality Verification Prompting": {
            "Problem": "LLMs can sometimes generate irrational or logically inconsistent responses when prompted with complex reasoning tasks. Verifying the rationality of LLM responses is important for improving their robustness and reliability.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for verifying LLM rationality include using external knowledge bases or rule-based systems to check for logical consistency, or using human evaluations to assess the reasonableness of responses. However, these methods can be limited by the coverage of the knowledge bases or the scalability of human evaluations.",
            "Motivation": "We can leverage LLMs' own reasoning capabilities to verify the rationality of their responses. By prompting LLMs to analyze and critique their own responses, we can identify potential logical flaws or inconsistencies in a more flexible and contextual way.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a rationality verification prompting technique that works as follows. First, we prompt the LLM to generate a response to the input prompt as usual. We then prompt the LLM to critically analyze its own response, using instructions like 'Identify any logical flaws or inconsistencies in the previous response', or 'Argue against the claims made in the previous response'. If the LLM identifies any issues with its original response, we prompt it to generate a revised response that addresses those issues. We repeat this process of response generation and self-verification until the LLM cannot find any more issues with its response.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate rationality verification prompting on various benchmarks for logical reasoning and consistency, such as LogiQA, CLUTRR, and StrategyQA. Compare with baseline methods that use external knowledge bases or human evaluations. Also measure the number of verification rounds needed to achieve stable and rational responses for different types of prompts."
        },
        "Adversarial Prompt Refinement": {
            "Problem": "Large language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can manipulate their outputs in unintended ways, raising security and privacy concerns.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for defending against adversarial prompts include adversarial training, adversarial example detection, and defensive distillation.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a novel approach that leverages the language model's own understanding of natural language to refine potentially adversarial prompts into benign ones, while preserving the original intent.",
            "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Prompt Refinement (APR), a prompting technique that consists of three steps: 1) Adversarial Prompt Detection: We prompt the language model to analyze the input prompt and identify potentially adversarial components. 2) Prompt Rewriting: We prompt the model to rewrite the potentially adversarial components of the prompt in a way that maintains the original intent but removes the adversarial aspects. This is done through a series of prompts that guide the model to consider alternative phrasings and wordings. 3) Refined Prompt Execution: The refined, non-adversarial prompt is then fed back into the language model to generate the final output.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate APR on established adversarial prompt benchmarks, comparing its performance to baseline methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and preservation of original prompt intent. We will also conduct human evaluations to assess the quality and coherence of the refined prompts and outputs."
        },
        "Contextual Integrity Prompting": {
            "Problem": "Language models can be prompted to generate outputs that violate privacy expectations or disclose sensitive information, even if unintended by the prompt author.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches to improving language model privacy focus on data filtering, differential privacy, and access control.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a prompting strategy that incorporates contextual integrity principles, encouraging the model to consider the appropriateness of information disclosure given the social context implied by the prompt.",
            "Proposed Method": "Contextual Integrity Prompting (CIP) works as follows: 1) Context Extraction: The input prompt is analyzed to extract key entities, roles, and relationships that define the social context. 2) Norm Generation: Based on the extracted context, the language model is prompted to generate a set of norms that govern information flow expectations in this context. These norms specify what types of information are appropriate to disclose to whom. 3) Norm-Guided Generation: During the output generation process, the model is repeatedly prompted to check its outputs against the generated norms, and to self-correct if any norm violations are detected.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CIP on a range of prompts that involve potentially sensitive information disclosures, comparing the privacy properties of the outputs to those of baseline models. We will use both automated privacy metrics and human judgments of appropriateness. We will also test the robustness of CIP to adversarial prompts designed to bypass contextual norm checking."
        },
        "Deception Detection Prompting": {
            "Problem": "Language models can be misled by deceptive or manipulated prompts into generating false, biased, or harmful outputs.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to detecting deceptive prompts include stylometric analysis, fact-checking, and coherence assessment.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a prompting technique that leverages the language model's own capacity for natural language understanding to detect and flag signs of deception in prompts.",
            "Proposed Method": "Deception Detection Prompting (DDP) involves the following steps: 1) Deception Cue Identification: The language model is prompted to analyze the input prompt for linguistic and semantic cues that are indicative of deception, such as inconsistencies, exaggerations, or manipulative framing. 2) Deception Scoring: Based on the identified cues, the model is prompted to generate a deception likelihood score for the prompt. 3) Skeptical Generation: If the deception score exceeds a threshold, the model is prompted to generate an output that is explicitly skeptical or qualifying of the claims made in the prompt.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DDP on datasets of deceptive and manipulated prompts, comparing its detection accuracy to baseline methods. We will also measure the quality and appropriateness of the skeptical outputs generated in response to deceptive prompts. Human evaluations will be used to assess both detection accuracy and output quality."
        },
        "Ethical Constraint Prompting": {
            "Problem": "Language models can be prompted to generate outputs that violate ethical principles or promote harmful biases, even if not explicitly instructed to do so.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to improving language model ethics include filtering training data, incorporating ethical rules into the model objective, and using separate classifiers to detect unethical outputs.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a prompting method that explicitly incorporates ethical constraints into the generation process, guiding the model to consider the ethical implications of its outputs at each step.",
            "Proposed Method": "Ethical Constraint Prompting (ECP) works as follows: 1) Ethical Principle Generation: The language model is prompted to generate a set of high-level ethical principles relevant to the input prompt, such as principles of fairness, non-maleficence, or respect for persons. 2) Constraint Propagation: At each step of the output generation process, the model is prompted to consider how the ethical principles constrain the space of acceptable outputs. This is done through prompts that encourage the model to reason about the implications and consequences of different generation choices. 3) Ethical Filtering: After generation, the model is prompted to review the full output and identify any parts that may violate the ethical constraints. If violations are found, the model is prompted to revise the output.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ECP on a range of ethically challenging prompts, comparing the outputs to those of baseline models in terms of adherence to ethical principles. We will use both automated metrics of ethical alignment and human judgments of output appropriateness. We will also test the robustness of ECP to adversarial prompts designed to bypass ethical constraints."
        },
        "Socratic Probing": {
            "Problem": "Language models can be biased to generate overconfident or unsupported claims when prompted with leading questions or statements.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing methods to mitigate this bias include calibrating model probabilities, generating diverse outputs, and using external knowledge to fact-check claims.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a prompting strategy inspired by the Socratic method, where the model is prompted to critically examine and justify its own outputs through a series of probing questions.",
            "Proposed Method": "Socratic Probing (SP) consists of the following steps: 1) Initial Claim Generation: The language model is prompted with the original input to generate an initial output claim. 2) Probing Question Generation: The model is then prompted to generate a series of probing questions that challenge or cast doubt on the initial claim, such as asking for evidence, considering counterarguments, or exploring implications. 3) Claim Justification: For each probing question, the model is prompted to generate a response that attempts to justify the initial claim in light of the challenge posed by the question. 4) Confidence Scoring: Based on the quality and convincingness of the justifications, the model is prompted to generate a confidence score for the initial claim. 5) Claim Revision: If the confidence score is below a threshold, the model is prompted to revise the initial claim to be more nuanced, qualified, or uncertain as appropriate.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SP on datasets of prompts known to elicit overconfident or unsupported claims from language models, comparing the calibration and justifiability of the outputs to those of baseline models. We will use both automated metrics of claim quality and human evaluations of output trustworthiness. We will also test the ability of SP to generalize to new domains and prompt styles."

        "Adversarial Prompt Ensemble": {
            "Problem": "Large language models are susceptible to adversarial prompts that can manipulate their outputs in undesirable ways, potentially leading to harmful or biased responses.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to mitigate adversarial prompts include adversarial training, prompt filtering, and output monitoring. However, these methods often require extensive computational resources or human supervision.",
            "Motivation": "Ensemble learning has been shown to improve robustness in various machine learning tasks. By combining multiple diverse models or prompts, the system can leverage their complementary strengths to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose an Adversarial Prompt Ensemble (APE) method that generates a diverse set of prompts for a given input, each designed to elicit different aspects of the model's knowledge and reasoning capabilities. These prompts are constructed using techniques such as paraphrasing, context perturbation, and counterfactual reasoning. The model's outputs for each prompt are then aggregated using a weighted voting scheme, where the weights are determined by the prompts' ability to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks during a validation phase. This ensemble approach helps to neutralize the effect of any single adversarial prompt and provides a more robust final output.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate APE on existing adversarial prompt benchmarks, such as the Adversarial NLI dataset, and compare its performance with baseline methods like adversarial training and prompt filtering. Additionally, assess APE's robustness to new types of adversarial prompts generated by human annotators or other models."

        "Adversarial Prompt Detection via Language Model Scoring": {
            "Problem": "Adversarial prompts can manipulate large language models to generate harmful, biased, or factually incorrect outputs. Detecting these malicious prompts is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of language model applications.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for detecting adversarial prompts often rely on handcrafted rules, heuristics, or supervised learning approaches that require labeled examples of adversarial prompts.",
            "Motivation": "Language models themselves can be leveraged to detect anomalous or adversarial prompts by assessing their likelihood under the model's learned distribution. Prompts that are significantly less likely than benign prompts can be flagged as potentially adversarial.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel approach for adversarial prompt detection that utilizes the language model itself as a scoring function. Given a prompt, we calculate its likelihood under the language model and compare it to a threshold derived from the likelihoods of a set of known benign prompts. If the prompt's likelihood falls below the threshold, it is flagged as potentially adversarial. To improve the detector's robustness, we also employ techniques such as temperature scaling and ensembling multiple language models. Furthermore, we investigate the use of contrastive learning to train the language model to assign higher likelihoods to benign prompts and lower likelihoods to adversarial ones.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on existing adversarial prompt datasets and compare its performance with baseline detection approaches. Conduct a series of experiments to assess the impact of various factors, such as the choice of language model, likelihood threshold, and contrastive learning techniques. Additionally, analyze the method's ability to generalize to new types of adversarial prompts and its robustness to adaptive attacks."

        "Counterfactual Prompt Augmentation": {
            "Problem": "Large language models can be misled by adversarial prompts that exploit their reliance on surface-level patterns and lack of deeper understanding. These prompts often contain subtle perturbations or manipulations that can lead to harmful or biased outputs.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches to improve robustness against adversarial prompts include adversarial training, data augmentation, and rule-based filtering. However, these methods often require large amounts of labeled data or domain-specific knowledge.",
            "Motivation": "Counterfactual reasoning has been shown to enhance model robustness and generalization in various tasks. By exposing the model to counterfactual prompts during training, we can improve its ability to distinguish between genuine and adversarial inputs.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel approach called Counterfactual Prompt Augmentation (CPA) that generates counterfactual prompts to augment the training data and improve the model's robustness. Given a genuine prompt, CPA generates counterfactual versions by applying a series of perturbations, such as word substitutions, sentence reordering, and negation. These counterfactual prompts are designed to maintain the overall semantic meaning while introducing adversarial patterns. During training, the model is exposed to both genuine and counterfactual prompts, along with their corresponding labels. This encourages the model to learn more robust representations and to focus on the underlying semantics rather than surface-level patterns.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CPA on existing adversarial prompt benchmarks and compare its performance with baseline methods such as adversarial training and data augmentation. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different types of counterfactual perturbations and their combinations. Additionally, analyze the model's ability to generalize to new types of adversarial prompts and its robustness to adaptive attacks."

However, these methods often require extensive human supervision or rely on predefined rules that may not generalize well to new types of adversarial prompts.",
            "Motivation": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to various natural language processing tasks, enabling models to learn optimal strategies through interaction with an environment. By formulating the task of adversarial prompt reformulation as an RL problem, we can train a model to automatically rewrite adversarial prompts into benign ones.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose an adversarial prompt reformulation approach based on reinforcement learning. The RL agent, a sequence-to-sequence model, learns to rewrite adversarial prompts into benign ones through interaction with a reward function. The reward function consists of multiple components, including (1) a measure of the generated output's safety and coherence, (2) a measure of the semantic similarity between the original and reformulated prompts, and (3) a measure of the reformulated prompt's ability to elicit a similar response from the language model as the original prompt. The RL agent is trained using policy gradient methods, such as REINFORCE or PPO, to maximize the expected cumulative reward. During inference, the trained agent is used to reformulate potentially adversarial prompts before passing them to the language model.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on existing adversarial prompt datasets and compare its performance with baseline approaches, such as prompt filtering and adversarial training. Conduct a series of experiments to assess the impact of different reward function components and RL algorithms. Analyze the reformulated prompts' quality and their ability to mitigate adversarial attacks. Additionally, investigate the method's generalization capabilities and robustness to adaptive attacks."

            "Problem": "Large language models are often trained on sensitive data, such as personal information or confidential documents. Adversarial actors may attempt to extract this sensitive information from the model by crafting specific prompts that exploit the model's memorization capabilities.",

            "Motivation": "Privacy-preserving techniques, such as homomorphic encryption and secure enclaves, have been successfully applied to protect sensitive data in various domains. By integrating these techniques into the prompt encoding process, we can ensure that sensitive information is not leaked through the model's outputs.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a privacy-preserving prompt encoding approach that utilizes homomorphic encryption and secure enclaves to protect sensitive information during the prompt-model interaction. The sensitive parts of the input prompt are encrypted using a homomorphic encryption scheme, allowing the language model to process the encrypted data without direct access to the plaintext. The decryption and generation of the final output are performed within a secure enclave, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed to the outside world. To maintain the language model's performance, we investigate techniques such as encrypted fine-tuning and encrypted prompt template learning, which enable the model to adapt to the encrypted prompts while preserving privacy.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on datasets containing sensitive information and assess its ability to prevent information leakage through adversarial prompts. Compare the method's performance with baseline approaches, such as differential privacy and federated learning. Conduct experiments to measure the impact of encryption on the model's output quality and the computational overhead introduced by the privacy-preserving techniques.

            "Existing Methods": "Current defenses include adversarial training, input filtering, and output truncation, but they often degrade model performance and generalization.",
            "Motivation": "Ensemble methods have shown strong robustness against adversarial examples in other domains. By distilling the knowledge from an ensemble of diverse adversarially-trained models into a single model via prompting, we can potentially achieve strong robustness without sacrificing performance or requiring expensive retraining.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Prompt Ensemble Distillation (APED), a novel defense method that leverages an ensemble of adversarially-trained teacher models to guide the prompting of a student model. Specifically, we first train a diverse set of teacher models on different types of adversarial prompts. Then, given a new input prompt, we query each teacher model to generate its predicted output. We aggregate the teacher outputs to construct a majority-vote prompt that instructs the student model to follow the consensus output. Finally, the student model generates the final output guided by the majority-vote prompt. The intuition is that the ensemble prompt can neutralize the adversarial patterns and steer the student model towards robust generations.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate APED on standard benchmarks for adversarial attacks on language models, such as ANLI, Dynabench, and RealToxicityPrompts. We will compare APED with baseline defenses such as adversarial training and prompt filtering, in terms of both robustness against adversarial attacks and performance on benign inputs. We will also analyze the transferability of APED across different model architectures and domains."

            "Existing Methods": "Current proactive defenses mainly focus on adversarial training, which can be expensive and may overfit to specific types of attacks.",
            "Motivation": "Humans can often proactively reason about potential vulnerabilities and protect against them by considering counterfactual scenarios. We hypothesize that prompting language models to proactively analyze and fix their own vulnerabilities via counterfactual reasoning can improve their intrinsic robustness.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Proactive Robustness via Counterfactual Prompting (PRCP), a novel self-supervised learning framework for proactively improving language models' intrinsic robustness. Given a language model and a corpus of text, PRCP first prompts the model to generate a set of potential adversarial attacks that could fool itself. Then, for each generated adversarial prompt, PRCP prompts the model to analyze its own potential vulnerabilities and generate a counterfactual prompt that can guide itself to produce a safe output. Finally, PRCP uses the generated counterfactual prompts to fine-tune the model via a consistency loss, which encourages the model to produce similar outputs for the original and counterfactual prompts. By iteratively generating adversarial and counterfactual prompts, PRCP enables the model to proactively learn to be more robust.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PRCP on a range of language models and datasets, and compare it with baseline defenses such as adversarial training and reactive filtering. We will measure the model's robustness against both seen and unseen types of adversarial attacks, as well as its performance on benign inputs. We will also analyze the quality and diversity of the generated adversarial and counterfactual prompts, and study the effect of different prompt generation strategies and fine-tuning objectives."

            "Existing Methods": "Many adversarial defenses for language models, such as adversarial training and data augmentation, can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to unforeseen attacks.",
            "Motivation": "Randomized smoothing is a certified adversarial defense framework that has shown promise in improving the robustness of image classifiers. The key idea is to add random noise to the input during inference to smoothen the model's output distribution and make it more robust to adversarial perturbations. We propose to extend this idea to language models via prompt-based noise injection.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a prompt-based adversarial defense framework called PAR (Prompt-based Adversarial Robustness), which leverages randomized smoothing to improve the robustness of large language models without expensive retraining. Given an input prompt, PAR first constructs a set of randomly perturbed prompts by injecting various types of noise, such as synonym replacement, word order shuffling, and grammatical transformation, via prompting an external language model. Then, PAR prompts the target language model with each perturbed prompt and aggregates the generated outputs via majority voting or other ensemble methods to obtain the final robust output. PAR also includes a calibration mechanism to adaptively adjust the noise level based on the input's uncertainty, to avoid over-smoothing benign inputs.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PAR on a diverse set of adversarial attack benchmarks, such as ANLI, Dynabench, and RealToxicityPrompts, and compare it with state-of-the-art adversarial defenses for language models. We will measure the certified robustness of PAR under different types and levels of noise, and analyze the trade-off between robustness and accuracy on benign inputs. We will also study the transferability of PAR across different language models and the effect of prompt noise types and ensemble methods."

Then, ARAP evaluates the generated prompts using an ensemble of adversarial attack and defense methods, and selects the most critical prompts that reveal new vulnerabilities or challenge existing defenses. Finally, ARAP prompts the language model to analyze the selected prompts and generate robust responses, which are used to fine-tune the model for enhanced robustness. By actively selecting and learning from the most informative prompts, ARAP enables the language model to efficiently adapt to new attack patterns and improve its worst-case robustness.",

Carefully analyze it for any deceptive or misleading elements.\") 2) Skeptical reasoning prompts that encourage the model to deeply scrutinize the input and question its validity before responding (e.g. \"Before accepting the claims in the input, try to think of ways they could be false, misleading or harmful. Do not simply take the input at face value.\") 3) Robustness self-reflection prompts that ask the model to check its own response for any inconsistencies or concerning outputs that could have been induced by the adversarial prompt (e.g. \"Reflect on your response above.

It should try to identify any biases, shortcuts, or potential vulnerabilities in its behavior. 2) Defense Strategy Generation: For each identified vulnerability, the model is tasked with generating robust response strategies. These could involve asking for clarification, refusing unsafe requests, or providing more balanced and unbiased responses. 3) Adversarial Testing: The model's defense strategies are stress-tested against a suite of adversarial prompts.

These paraphrases should capture the same semantic meaning as the original, but with variations in wording and syntax. This can be done using another language model trained for paraphrasing. 2) Parallel Generation: We feed each of the k paraphrased prompts independently to the language model, generating k parallel outputs. 3) Consistency Checking: We use a consistency scoring function to measure the semantic similarity of the k outputs.

We will compare PPPF to baseline methods such as differential privacy and post-processing techniques. We hypothesize that PPPF will effectively preserve privacy while maintaining high output quality, all without the need for expensive training or post-processing steps."

        "Adversarial Prompt Spotlight": {
            "Problem": "Large language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can manipulate their behavior and outputs, potentially leading to harmful or biased responses.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for defending against adversarial prompts include adversarial training, prompt filtering, and using separate models for detecting malicious prompts.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a novel prompting method that can help language models identify and focus on the most relevant and trustworthy parts of the input prompt, while ignoring or downplaying potentially adversarial or irrelevant sections.",
            "Proposed Method": "Our method, called Adversarial Prompt Spotlight, works by first prompting the language model to analyze the input prompt and identify which parts are most relevant and trustworthy for the given task. This is done by constructing a 'spotlight prompt' that asks the model to assign relevance and trustworthiness scores to different sections of the input. The model then generates a new prompt that only includes the sections with high relevance and trustworthiness, effectively filtering out potential adversarial or irrelevant parts. This filtered prompt is then used for the actual task completion. The spotlighting process can be repeated iteratively to refine the prompt further.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on various benchmarks for adversarial prompt detection and task completion accuracy, comparing against baselines such as vanilla prompting and adversarial training. We will also conduct human evaluations to assess the coherence and safety of the model outputs."

        "Prompt-based Adversarial Simulator": {
            "Problem": "Existing methods for improving language models' robustness against adversarial attacks often require large-scale adversarial data collection or expensive human feedback, which can be time-consuming and costly.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include adversarial training on manually crafted adversarial prompts, using separate models for adversarial prompt detection, and human-in-the-loop feedback for identifying and correcting undesirable model behaviors.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a novel approach that leverages the language model itself to generate realistic adversarial prompts, which can then be used for training the model to be more robust. This eliminates the need for manual data collection or human feedback.",
            "Proposed Method": "Our method, called Prompt-based Adversarial Simulator (PAS), works by prompting the language model to act as an adversary and generate prompts that are designed to manipulate or deceive the model. This is done by providing the model with a 'simulator prompt' that describes the goal of the adversary (e.g., to generate biased or harmful responses) and the types of adversarial techniques to use (e.g., contextual misalignment, logical fallacies, emotional manipulation). The model then generates a diverse set of adversarial prompts, which are used to train the model itself to be more robust. The training process involves fine-tuning the model on the adversarial prompts, using techniques such as adversarial training or regularization to improve its robustness.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PAS on various language modeling tasks, comparing its robustness against adversarial attacks to baseline models trained without adversarial simulation. We will measure both the model's accuracy on the original task and its ability to resist adversarial prompts, using metrics such as adversarial success rate and perplexity. We will also conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of PAS, such as the simulator prompt design and training techniques."

        "Collaborative Prompt Verification": {
            "Problem": "Language models can be easily fooled by adversarial prompts that exploit their lack of common sense reasoning and real-world knowledge. Existing defense methods often rely on a single model to detect and filter out malicious prompts, which can be error-prone.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include using a separate classifier model to detect adversarial prompts, adversarial training to improve robustness, and human-in-the-loop verification of model outputs.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a novel approach that leverages multiple language models to collaboratively verify the safety and correctness of prompts and outputs. By having models with diverse knowledge and capabilities cross-check each other, we can improve the overall robustness and reliability of the system.",
            "Proposed Method": "Our method, called Collaborative Prompt Verification (CPV), works by employing an ensemble of language models with diverse architectures, training data, and parameters. Given an input prompt, each model in the ensemble first generates its own output independently. Then, the models engage in a multi-round verification process, where they take turns to scrutinize each other's outputs and provide feedback on their safety, factual correctness, and coherence. This is done by prompting each model to compare its output with others' and identify any discrepancies or potential issues. The models then revise their outputs based on the feedback and repeat the verification process until a consensus is reached. The final output is a verified response that has been checked and improved by multiple models.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CPV on various language modeling tasks that involve open-ended generation, such as dialogue response generation and story completion. We will measure the models' robustness against adversarial prompts that are designed to elicit unsafe or incorrect responses, using metrics such as adversarial success rate and human evaluation of output safety and coherence. We will compare CPV with single-model baselines and conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of ensemble diversity and verification rounds."

            "Problem": "Adversarial training is an effective method for improving language models' robustness, but it often requires sharing large amounts of sensitive user data with the model provider, which can raise privacy concerns. Existing methods for privacy-preserving adversarial training, such as differential privacy, can significantly degrade model performance.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for privacy-preserving adversarial training include using differential privacy to add noise to the training data or model gradients, federated learning to train models on decentralized data, and using synthetic data generated by a separate model.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a novel approach that combines prompt-based adversarial training with privacy-preserving techniques to improve language models' robustness without compromising user privacy. By using prompts to guide the generation of adversarial examples and using secure multi-party computation to aggregate model updates, we can achieve a better trade-off between privacy and performance.",
            "Proposed Method": "Our method, called Prompt-based Adversarial Training with Privacy Preservation (PAPP), works by first prompting the language model to generate a diverse set of adversarial examples based on a small set of seed examples provided by the users. The prompts are designed to guide the model to generate examples that are similar to the seeds but with variations in wording, style, and content. The generated examples are then used to fine-tune the model using adversarial training, where the model is trained to predict the correct output for each example while being robust to perturbations. To preserve privacy, the model updates are computed using secure multi-party computation, where the users and the model provider collaboratively compute the gradients without revealing their individual data. The updated model is then sent back to the users for further fine-tuning on their local data.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PAPP on various language modeling tasks that involve sensitive user data, such as email composition and personal assistant. We will measure the models' robustness against adversarial attacks and their performance on the original tasks, using metrics such as adversarial success rate and perplexity. We will compare PAPP with non-private adversarial training and differential privacy baselines, and conduct user studies to evaluate the perceived privacy and utility of the models. We will also analyze the trade-off between privacy and performance by varying the amount of noise added to the model updates and the number of adversarial examples generated."

            "Problem": "Adversarial attacks on language models often involve inserting subtle triggers or patterns into the input prompt that can manipulate the model's output without being easily detectable by humans. Existing defense methods often rely on training a separate model to detect such triggers, which can be costly and time-consuming.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for detecting adversarial triggers include using a separate classifier model trained on adversarial examples, adversarial training to improve the model's robustness, and human-in-the-loop detection of suspicious patterns.",
            "Motivation": "We propose a novel prompting method that can help language models detect and highlight potential adversarial triggers in the input prompt, without requiring any additional training or model components. By leveraging the model's own knowledge and attention mechanisms, we can make it more self-aware and robust against adversarial attacks.",
            "Proposed Method": "Our method, called Contextual Prompting for Detecting Adversarial Triggers (CPAT), works by augmenting the input prompt with a series of sub-prompts that are designed to probe the model's understanding of the context and its attention to different parts of the input. These sub-prompts can include questions that ask the model to summarize the main points of the prompt, identify any irrelevant or suspicious elements, and explain the reasoning behind its output. By comparing the model's responses to these sub-prompts with its original output, we can detect any inconsistencies or anomalies that may indicate the presence of adversarial triggers. The model can then highlight these potential triggers in the input and provide a warning to the user or a downstream system.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CPAT on various language modeling tasks that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as sentiment analysis and text classification. We will measure the model's ability to detect and highlight adversarial triggers in the input, using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. We will compare CPAT with baseline methods that use separate detector models or adversarial training, and conduct human evaluations to assess the effectiveness and interpretability of the model's explanations. We will also analyze the trade-off between the number and complexity of sub-prompts and the model's detection performance and efficiency."
