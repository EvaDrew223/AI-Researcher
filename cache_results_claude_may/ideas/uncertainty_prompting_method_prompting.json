The prompts are designed to capture different aspects or interpretations of the input, such as rephrasing the question, providing additional context, or asking for clarification. The LLM is then prompted to generate a response for each prompt, along with an associated confidence score.

By applying contrastive learning techniques to the prompting process, we can help LLMs better differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to more calibrated confidence estimates.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Uncertainty Prompting (CUP), a prompting approach that uses contrastive learning to improve the uncertainty estimation of LLMs. During prompting, we generate a set of contrastive examples by perturbing the input text in ways that are designed to increase or decrease the model's uncertainty. For example, we may add noise to the input, remove key words or phrases, or replace entities with similar but incorrect alternatives. We then prompt the model to generate outputs for both the original and contrastive examples, and encourage it to assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive examples. By learning to distinguish between certain and uncertain predictions in a contrastive manner, CUP helps LLMs develop a more fine-grained understanding of their own uncertainty.",

If the uncertainty score is above a specified threshold, the model is prompted to generate a clarification question to elicit more information from the user. The user's response is then incorporated into the context, and the process is repeated until the model's uncertainty falls below the threshold or a maximum number of turns is reached.",

            "Proposed Method": "We propose Multitask Uncertainty Prompting (MUP), a prompting method that jointly elicits uncertainty estimates from LLMs across multiple diverse tasks and domains. The key steps are: 1) Construct a diverse set of prompts spanning different tasks (e.g., QA, NLI, summarization) and domains (e.g., science, history, literature). 2) For each prompt, generate a set of subquestions or subprompts that probe different aspects of the model's uncertainty (e.g., \"What are the key assumptions behind your answer?\" or \"How might your response change if X was different?\"). 3) Prompt the model to generate responses and uncertainty estimates for each subprompt. 4) Aggregate the uncertainty estimates across the subprompts and tasks to obtain a calibrated overall uncertainty score. 5) Fine-tune the prompts and subprompts based on the model's calibration performance across the diverse tasks.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MUP on a diverse set of benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks and domains, such as GLUE, SuperGLUE, and MultiNLI. Compare against single-task prompting baselines as well as multitask fine-tuning approaches. Metrics include overall calibration error, domain-specific calibration, and accuracy-uncertainty correlation."

        "Hierarchical Uncertainty Prompting": {
            "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide granular and interpretable uncertainty estimates that distinguish between different sources or levels of uncertainty, such as data uncertainty, model uncertainty, and task-specific uncertainty.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for hierarchical uncertainty estimation in deep learning models include Bayesian hierarchical models, deep ensembles with different architectures, and probabilistic circuits. However, these methods are often computationally expensive and may not be directly applicable to prompting-based approaches.",
            "Motivation": "By designing prompts that elicit uncertainty estimates at different levels of granularity and abstraction, we can encourage LLMs to provide more interpretable and actionable uncertainty scores. Hierarchical prompting can also help to disentangle different sources of uncertainty and identify specific areas for improvement.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Hierarchical Uncertainty Prompting (HUP), a prompting method that elicits uncertainty estimates at multiple levels of granularity and abstraction. The key steps are: 1) Given an input query, generate a hierarchical set of subprompts that probe uncertainties at different levels (e.g., data-level, model-level, task-level). 2) For each subprompt, generate a set of clarification questions or assumptions to further probe the model's uncertainty (e.g., \"What additional information would help to reduce uncertainty in this aspect?\"). 3) Prompt the model to generate responses and uncertainty estimates for each subprompt and clarification question. 4) Aggregate the uncertainty estimates hierarchically to obtain calibrated scores at each level of abstraction. 5) Use the hierarchical uncertainty scores to identify specific areas for improvement or clarification.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate HUP on benchmark datasets for tasks that involve multiple levels of uncertainty, such as open-domain QA, multi-hop reasoning, and task-oriented dialogue. Compare against flat prompting baselines and hierarchical Bayesian models. Metrics include level-specific calibration errors, interpretability scores, and task performance at different uncertainty thresholds."

        "Metacognitive Calibration Prompting": {
            "Problem": "LLMs often lack explicit metacognitive skills to assess and calibrate their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident or underconfident predictions across different contexts.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving metacognitive skills in LLMs include explicitly training models to generate explanations or chains of thought, as well as using meta-prompts to encourage reflective reasoning. However, these methods often rely on task-specific annotations or heuristics and may not generalize well to new domains.",
            "Motivation": "By designing prompts that explicitly elicit metacognitive reasoning and self-assessment from LLMs, we can encourage the models to develop more robust and generalizable uncertainty calibration skills. Metacognitive prompting can also help to make the model's reasoning process more transparent and interpretable.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Calibration Prompting (MCP), a prompting method that explicitly elicits metacognitive reasoning and self-assessment from LLMs to improve uncertainty calibration. The key steps are: 1) Given an input query, generate a set of metacognitive prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its own knowledge and reasoning process (e.g., \"What are the key factors influencing your confidence in this answer?\"). 2) Prompt the model to generate a chain of thought that walks through its reasoning process and highlights any sources of uncertainty or confusion. 3) Based on the generated chain of thought, prompt the model to provide a calibrated uncertainty estimate and a justification for its level of confidence. 4) Fine-tune the metacognitive prompts based on the model's calibration performance and the quality of its explanations.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MCP on benchmark datasets for tasks that require metacognitive reasoning, such as self-awareness probes, introspective reports, and confidence calibration. Compare against baseline prompting methods that do not explicitly elicit metacognition. Metrics include calibration error, explanation quality (as judged by human raters), and generalization to new domains or tasks."
