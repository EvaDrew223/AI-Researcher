        "Hierarchical Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "Generating complex code from high-level specifications remains challenging for large language models. The generated code often lacks proper structure and modularity, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly rely on direct prompting or few-shot prompting, which often fail to capture the hierarchical structure of the code.",
            "Motivation": "Human programmers often break down a complex problem into smaller subproblems and solve them in a hierarchical manner. By mimicking this process, we can guide the language model to generate more structured and modular code.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a hierarchical prompting approach for code generation. Given a high-level specification, we first prompt the model to generate an outline of the code structure, including the main components and their relationships. Then, we iteratively prompt the model to fill in the details of each component, following the generated outline. The prompts at each level of the hierarchy provide guidance on the expected structure and functionality of the code. The model is encouraged to generate modular and reusable code snippets at each level, which are then composed to form the final code.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code generation benchmarks such as APPS and HumanEval. We will compare the performance with baselines such as direct prompting and few-shot prompting. The generated code will be evaluated based on correctness, modularity, and readability, using both automatic metrics and human evaluation."
        },
        "Iterative Refinement Prompting for Code Optimization": {
            "Problem": "Generated code often suffers from suboptimal performance, such as inefficient algorithms or redundant computations. Improving the efficiency of generated code is crucial for practical applications.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly focus on generating correct code, but pay less attention to the efficiency aspect. Some methods attempt to optimize the generated code using separate optimization tools, but they are limited by the capabilities of those tools.",
            "Motivation": "Large language models have shown impressive capabilities in understanding and generating code. By leveraging their knowledge, we can guide the models to iteratively refine the generated code for better efficiency.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose an iterative refinement prompting approach for code optimization. The process starts with an initial code generated from a high-level specification. Then, we prompt the model to analyze the code and identify potential inefficiencies, such as redundant computations or suboptimal algorithms. Based on the analysis, we prompt the model to suggest optimizations and generate refined versions of the code. This process is repeated iteratively until no further optimizations can be identified. The prompts at each iteration provide guidance on the optimization objectives and encourage the model to apply its knowledge to improve the code efficiency.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code optimization benchmarks, such as the CodeXGLUE benchmark. We will compare the performance with baselines such as direct prompting and few-shot prompting. The generated code will be evaluated based on efficiency metrics, such as runtime and memory usage, as well as correctness and readability. We will also conduct case studies to analyze the effectiveness of the iterative refinement process."
        },
        "Exemplar-Guided Prompting for Code Synthesis": {
            "Problem": "Generating code from natural language descriptions is challenging, especially when the descriptions are ambiguous or incomplete. Large language models often struggle to capture the precise intent of the user and generate code that matches the desired functionality.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly rely on direct prompting or few-shot prompting, where the model is provided with a few examples of code snippets and their corresponding descriptions. However, these approaches often fail to capture the nuances and variations in user requirements.",
            "Motivation": "Providing relevant and diverse examples can guide the language model to better understand the user's intent and generate code that matches the desired functionality. By leveraging a large corpus of code examples and their descriptions, we can dynamically select the most relevant examples to guide the code synthesis process.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose an exemplar-guided prompting approach for code synthesis. Given a natural language description of the desired functionality, we first retrieve a set of relevant code examples from a large corpus. The retrieval is based on the semantic similarity between the description and the examples' descriptions. Then, we prompt the model with the retrieved examples, along with the original description, to guide the code synthesis process. The prompts encourage the model to learn from the examples and generate code that matches the user's intent. The retrieved examples are dynamically updated based on the generated code and the user's feedback, allowing for iterative refinement of the synthesized code.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code synthesis benchmarks, such as the CoNaLa and CodeSearchNet datasets. We will compare the performance with baselines such as direct prompting and few-shot prompting. The generated code will be evaluated based on correctness, relevance to the user's intent, and diversity. We will also conduct user studies to assess the effectiveness of the exemplar-guided prompting in real-world scenarios, where users provide natural language descriptions of their desired functionality."
        },
        "Syntax-Guided Prompting for Code Error Correction": {
            "Problem": "Identifying and correcting errors in code is a common task in software development. Large language models have shown potential in code error detection, but their ability to provide accurate and precise error corrections is still limited.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning the language model on a large corpus of code and their corresponding error corrections. However, these approaches often struggle to capture the syntactic and semantic rules of the programming language, leading to incorrect or suboptimal corrections.",
            "Motivation": "Programming languages have well-defined syntax and semantic rules. By incorporating these rules into the prompting process, we can guide the language model to generate syntactically valid and semantically meaningful error corrections.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a syntax-guided prompting approach for code error correction. Given a code snippet with errors, we first parse the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). Then, we traverse the AST and identify the nodes that contain errors, based on the syntax and semantic rules of the programming language. For each error node, we prompt the model with the surrounding context and the expected syntax and semantic constraints. The prompts guide the model to generate corrections that adhere to the language rules and maintain the overall structure of the code. The corrected code is then validated against the AST to ensure its syntactic and semantic validity.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code error correction benchmarks, such as the DeepFix and IITK-BPGC datasets. We will compare the performance with baselines such as fine-tuning approaches and rule-based error correction tools. The generated corrections will be evaluated based on correctness, precision, and recall. We will also conduct case studies to analyze the effectiveness of the syntax-guided prompting in handling different types of code errors, such as syntax errors, type errors, and logical errors."
        },
        "Collaborative Prompting for Code Review": {
            "Problem": "Code review is an essential process in software development to ensure code quality and maintainability. However, performing code reviews is time-consuming and requires expertise in the programming language and domain. Large language models can assist in the code review process, but their suggestions often lack the context and rationale behind the changes.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning the language model on a large corpus of code reviews and their corresponding changes. However, these approaches often generate generic comments and suggestions that lack the specific context and reasoning behind the changes.",
            "Motivation": "Effective code review requires collaboration and communication between the reviewer and the code author. By engaging the language model in a collaborative prompting process, we can generate more contextual and informative code review suggestions.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose a collaborative prompting approach for code review. Given a code change and its corresponding description, we prompt the model to generate code review suggestions in a conversational manner. The prompts encourage the model to ask clarifying questions, provide rationale for the suggested changes, and engage in a dialogue with the code author. The code author can provide feedback and additional context, which is then used to refine the code review suggestions. The collaborative prompting process continues until a satisfactory code review is achieved. The generated code review suggestions are accompanied by explanations and references to coding best practices and standards.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code review datasets, such as the Code Review Open Platform (CROP) dataset. We will compare the performance with baselines such as fine-tuning approaches and rule-based code review tools. The generated code review suggestions will be evaluated based on relevance, clarity, and usefulness. We will conduct user studies with developers to assess the effectiveness of the collaborative prompting in real-world code review scenarios. The user studies will gather feedback on the quality and helpfulness of the generated code review suggestions and the overall user experience of the collaborative code review process."
        },
        "Socratic Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate code that is syntactically correct but semantically flawed or logically inconsistent. They also struggle to generate code for complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and abstraction.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing benchmarks like HumanEval and APPS test LLMs' code generation capabilities from natural language descriptions. Baseline methods include direct prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting.",
            "Motivation": "The Socratic method is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. We posit that prompting LLMs to engage in a Socratic dialogue while generating code can help them reason about the problem more abstractly, break it down into smaller subproblems, and generate more logically consistent code.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Socratic Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to engage in a multi-turn dialogue to generate code. The dialogue starts with the problem description. At each turn, the LLM is prompted to ask a clarifying question about the problem or the approach to solve it. The answer to this question (also generated by the LLM) is added to the context. The LLM then attempts to generate code based on the accumulated context. If the code is complete and correct, the dialogue ends. If not, the LLM is prompted to identify issues or missing pieces in the current code, and the process repeats. The key is to prompt the LLM to ask meaningful questions that lead to a robust problem-solving approach.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Socratic Prompting on the HumanEval and APPS benchmarks, comparing it with baselines like direct prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting. We will measure pass@k rates and code quality metrics. We will also perform a qualitative analysis of the generated dialogues to understand how Socratic Prompting aids the reasoning process."
        },
        "Adversarial Prompting for Robust Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "LLMs can generate code that passes test cases but fails on edge cases or slight variations of the input. They also tend to generate code that is not robust to minor perturbations in the problem description.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and APPS only test on a fixed set of problems and test cases. Some methods attempt to improve robustness by adversarial training or data augmentation.",
            "Motivation": "Adversarial examples have been widely used in domains like computer vision and NLP to improve model robustness. The idea is to create small perturbations to the input that cause the model to make errors. By training on these adversarial examples, the model learns to be more robust. We propose to apply this idea to prompting for code generation.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to generate both a solution and adversarial examples for a given coding problem. Specifically, we first prompt the LLM to generate code for the original problem. Then, we prompt it to generate adversarial examples: slight variations of the problem description or edge case inputs that the current code might fail on. We then prompt the LLM to revise the code to handle these adversarial examples. This process repeats for a few iterations. The key is to prompt the LLM to generate meaningful adversarial examples that expose weaknesses in the current code.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Adversarial Prompting on modified versions of HumanEval and APPS that include adversarial examples. We will compare with baselines like direct prompting and few-shot prompting on both the original and adversarial test sets. We will measure pass@k rates and code robustness metrics. We will also analyze the quality of the generated adversarial examples."
        },
        "Example-Critiquing Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "LLMs can generate code that is similar to the given examples but fails to handle novel variations or more complex cases. They also struggle to generate code that is more efficient or elegant than the examples.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing few-shot prompting methods for code generation provide examples of how to solve similar coding problems. However, they do not explicitly teach the model to critically analyze and improve upon the examples.",
            "Motivation": "When humans learn to code, they often study example solutions and then discuss their strengths and weaknesses. They learn to critique the examples and think about how to improve them. We propose to mimic this process in prompting LLMs for code generation.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Example-Critiquing Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to not just follow the given examples, but also critique them and generate improved solutions. Specifically, for each coding problem, we first provide a few example solutions of varying quality. We then prompt the LLM to critique each example by identifying its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Finally, we prompt the LLM to generate a new solution that addresses the identified weaknesses and incorporates the strengths of the examples. The key is to prompt the LLM to perform a thoughtful analysis of the examples and not just blindly imitate them.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Example-Critiquing Prompting on the HumanEval and APPS benchmarks, comparing it with baselines like direct prompting and standard few-shot prompting. We will measure pass@k rates and code quality metrics like efficiency and readability. We will also perform a qualitative analysis of the generated critiques and how they inform the final generated solution."
        },
        "Persona-Based Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "LLMs can generate code that is functional but lacks consistency in style, documentation, and design choices. Different developers have different coding personas, and LLMs should be able to generate code that adheres to a specific persona.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing code generation methods focus on functional correctness and do not explicitly control for coding style or persona. Some methods use style transfer techniques to impose a specific style on the generated code.",
            "Motivation": "In real-world software development, code is often written by teams of developers, each with their own coding persona. Consistency in style, documentation, and design choices is important for code maintainability and readability. We propose to use persona-based prompting to generate code that adheres to a specific developer's persona.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Persona-Based Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to generate code as if it were a specific developer with a distinct coding persona. Specifically, we first define a set of coding personas, each with their own style guidelines, documentation practices, and design principles. For each coding problem, we randomly select a persona and provide it as additional context in the prompt. We then prompt the LLM to generate code that both solves the problem and adheres to the selected persona's guidelines. The key is to create diverse and realistic coding personas and to prompt the LLM to generate code that is consistent with the selected persona.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Persona-Based Prompting on a new benchmark of coding problems that require not just functional correctness but also adherence to specific style and design guidelines. We will compare with baselines like direct prompting and few-shot prompting without persona context. We will measure pass@k rates, code quality metrics, and adherence to persona guidelines. We will also perform a qualitative analysis of the generated code to assess its consistency with the selected personas."
        },
        "Meta-Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "Designing effective prompts for code generation can be challenging and often requires domain expertise and trial-and-error. LLMs should be able to assist in the prompt engineering process itself.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing work on prompt engineering for code generation mainly relies on manual design and tuning of prompts. Some methods use automated search or optimization techniques to find good prompts.",
            "Motivation": "Prompt engineering is a critical but time-consuming aspect of using LLMs for code generation. However, LLMs have been shown to have strong abilities in natural language understanding and generation. We propose to leverage these abilities to assist in the prompt engineering process itself.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Meta-Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to generate effective prompts for code generation tasks. Specifically, given a coding problem, we first prompt the LLM to generate multiple candidate prompts that could be used to solve this problem. We then prompt the LLM to analyze each candidate prompt and score them based on criteria like clarity, specificity, and expected effectiveness. We select the highest-scored prompt and use it to actually generate the code. The key is to prompt the LLM to generate diverse and high-quality prompts and to critically evaluate them.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Meta-Prompting on a subset of problems from the HumanEval and APPS benchmarks. For each problem, we will use Meta-Prompting to generate the final prompt used for code generation. We will compare this with manually engineered prompts and prompts obtained through automated search methods. We will measure pass@k rates and prompt quality metrics like coherence and specificity. We will also perform a qualitative analysis of the generated prompts and their impact on the final generated code."
        },
        "Synthesis-Guided Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "Large language models struggle with generating complex code that satisfies multiple constraints and passes rigorous test cases.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for code generation typically rely on few-shot prompting with examples or fine-tuning on code datasets. However, these approaches often fail to generate code that passes all test cases, especially for complex problems with multiple constraints.",
            "Motivation": "Program synthesis techniques have shown promise in generating correct code by systematically searching the space of possible programs guided by specifications. We propose to integrate program synthesis ideas into the prompting process to guide the language model to generate code that satisfies the given constraints and passes the test cases.",
            "Proposed Method": "We introduce Synthesis-Guided Prompting (SGP) for code generation. Given a coding problem, we first automatically generate a high-level sketch of the solution that captures the key algorithmic insights. Then, we prompt the language model with this sketch, asking it to fill in the missing details to obtain the complete code. The model is also prompted with the constraints and test cases, and asked to verify the generated code against them. If the code fails any test cases, the model is prompted to identify the bug, fix it, and re-verify in an iterative refinement process until the code passes all tests. The key idea is to use the synthesized sketch to guide the generation process, and the constraints and tests to drive the refinement process towards correct code.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SGP on various competitive programming and coding interview problem benchmarks that involve complex algorithms and data structures. We will compare our approach with standard few-shot prompting and fine-tuning baselines, as well as program synthesis methods. The key evaluation metrics will be the percentage of problems solved (i.e., generated code passes all test cases), as well as the quality and efficiency of the generated code."
        },
        "Prompt Chaining for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "Generating correct and efficient code for complex problems often requires multiple intermediate steps, such as problem decomposition, algorithmic planning, implementation, testing, and debugging. Current language models struggle to effectively coordinate and execute these steps.",
            "Existing Methods": "Chain-of-thought prompting has shown promise in enabling language models to perform multi-step reasoning. However, it has mostly been applied to natural language tasks and not much to code generation.",
            "Motivation": "We propose to extend the idea of chain-of-thought prompting to the code generation setting. By breaking down the coding process into a sequence of smaller steps and prompting the model to generate intermediate outputs for each step, we can guide the model to generate better code.",
            "Proposed Method": "We introduce Prompt Chaining for Code Generation (PC-Code). Given a coding problem, we break down the solution process into multiple steps: 1) Problem Understanding: Analyze the problem description and identify key components such as input/output formats, constraints, and test cases. 2) Algorithm Design: Come up with a high-level algorithmic approach to solve the problem. 3) Implementation: Convert the algorithm into concrete code. 4) Testing: Generate test cases and evaluate the code. 5) Debugging: If the code fails any test cases, identify the bugs and fix them. We design a prompt template for each step, and chain them together to guide the model to sequentially generate the intermediate outputs, which then serve as context for the subsequent prompts. The key idea is to decompose the complex code generation process into manageable steps and provide structured guidance to the model via prompt chaining.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PC-Code on various competitive programming and coding interview problem benchmarks. We will compare our approach with standard few-shot prompting, as well as chain-of-thought prompting baselines. The key evaluation metrics will be the percentage of problems solved, the quality and efficiency of the generated code, as well as the interpretability of the intermediate outputs. We will also conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in the prompt chain."
        },
        "Code Comprehension Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "Generating correct and efficient code requires a deep understanding of the problem domain and the underlying algorithmic concepts. Current language models often struggle to capture this understanding and instead generate superficial or incorrect code.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for code generation typically rely on providing the model with problem descriptions, input/output examples, and sometimes reference code. However, they do not explicitly test the model's comprehension of the problem and the key algorithmic concepts.",
            "Motivation": "We propose to enhance the prompting process for code generation by first probing the model's understanding of the problem and the relevant algorithmic concepts. By asking the model to explain the problem, describe the key ideas for solving it, and even teach the concepts to a student, we can gauge its level of comprehension. The model's responses can then be used to provide additional context and guidance when prompting it to generate code.",
            "Proposed Method": "We introduce Code Comprehension Prompting (CCP) for code generation. Given a coding problem, we first prompt the model with a series of questions to test its understanding: 1) Problem Explanation: Explain the problem in your own words. 2) Algorithmic Ideas: Describe the key algorithmic ideas needed to solve this problem. 3) Concept Teaching: Imagine you are teaching these concepts to a computer science student. How would you explain them? We then use the model's responses to these questions as additional context when prompting it to generate code. Specifically, we include the problem explanation, algorithmic ideas, and concept teaching in the prompt template, along with the original problem description and input/output examples. The key idea is to first elicit the model's understanding of the problem and concepts, and then use that to guide the code generation process.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CCP on coding problems from various domains, such as algorithms, data structures, math, and programming language-specific tasks. We will compare our approach with standard prompting methods that do not include the comprehension steps. The key evaluation metrics will be the correctness and efficiency of the generated code, as well as the quality of the model's explanations and teachings. We will also conduct human evaluations to assess the usefulness of the model's responses for aiding comprehension and coding."
        },
        "Retrieval-Augmented Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "Large language models have a vast amount of knowledge, but they may still struggle to recall the most relevant information for a specific coding problem. This can lead to generated code that is incorrect, inefficient, or fails to use the best algorithmic approach.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for code generation typically rely on the knowledge stored in the model parameters. Some recent works have explored augmenting the model with external knowledge, but they often require fine-tuning the model on the retrieved information.",
            "Motivation": "We propose to augment the prompting process for code generation with a retrieval step that finds the most relevant code examples and algorithmic concepts from an external knowledge base. By providing the model with this additional context, we can help it recall the most useful information and generate better code.",
            "Proposed Method": "We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Prompting (RAP) for code generation. Given a coding problem, we first use a retrieval system to find the most relevant code examples and algorithmic concepts from a knowledge base, such as a collection of coding problems and solutions, algorithm tutorials, and programming language documentation. We then include these retrieved examples and concepts in the prompt template, along with the original problem description and input/output examples. The model is asked to study the retrieved information, explain how it relates to the current problem, and then generate a solution. The key idea is to augment the model's own knowledge with relevant external information and guide it to leverage that information in the code generation process.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate RAP on coding problems from various domains, such as algorithms, data structures, math, and programming language-specific tasks. We will compare our approach with standard prompting methods that do not include the retrieval step, as well as fine-tuning baselines that retrieve and train on additional data. The key evaluation metrics will be the correctness and efficiency of the generated code, as well as the relevance and usefulness of the retrieved information. We will also conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of the retrieval step and the impact of the knowledge base size and quality."

        "User Feedback-Driven Prompting for Code Generation": {
            "Problem": "Current code generation methods often produce code that is correct but may not meet the user's specific requirements or preferences. The generated code may be inefficient, hard to read, or not adhere to certain coding styles or conventions.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for code generation typically aim to produce correct code given a problem description and input/output examples. Some recent works have explored incorporating user feedback, but they often require fine-tuning the model on the feedback data.",
            "Motivation": "We propose to incorporate user feedback into the prompting process for code generation. By allowing the user to provide iterative feedback on the generated code, we can guide the model to refine the code to better meet the user's requirements and preferences.",
            "Proposed Method": "We introduce User Feedback-Driven Prompting (UFDP) for code generation. Given a coding problem, we first prompt the model to generate an initial solution. We then present this solution to the user and ask for feedback. The user can provide feedback in various forms, such as suggesting improvements, pointing out errors, or specifying additional requirements. We then incorporate this feedback into the prompt and ask the model to refine the code accordingly. This process is repeated for multiple iterations until the user is satisfied with the generated code. The key idea is to leverage user feedback to guide the model to generate code that not only solves the problem but also meets the user's specific needs and preferences.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UFDP on coding problems from various domains, such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning. We will recruit experienced programmers to provide feedback during the code generation process. We will compare our approach with standard prompting methods that do not incorporate user feedback, as well as fine-tuning baselines that train on user feedback data. The key evaluation metrics will be the quality and usability of the generated code, as well as the user satisfaction and engagement in the feedback process. We will also conduct qualitative analyses to understand the types and impact of user feedback on the code generation process."

            "Problem": "Large language models often generate code that is syntactically correct but fails to meet the functional requirements or contains logical errors.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for code generation primarily rely on providing natural language descriptions or input-output examples to guide the model.",
            "Motivation": "By executing the generated code and comparing the actual output with the expected output, the model can receive feedback on the functional correctness of the code. This feedback can then be used to iteratively refine the generated code until it meets the desired requirements.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Execution-Guided Prompting (EGP) for code generation. Given a programming task, EGP first prompts the model to generate an initial code solution. The generated code is then executed in a controlled environment, and the actual output is compared with the expected output. If there is a mismatch, the model is prompted to analyze the error and generate a refined version of the code. This process is repeated iteratively until the generated code produces the expected output. The prompts at each iteration include the original task description, the previously generated code, the execution error (if any), and instructions to refine the code based on the feedback.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate EGP on code generation benchmarks such as APPS and HumanEval. Compare the performance of EGP with baseline methods such as direct prompting and exemplar-based prompting. Measure the functional correctness and efficiency of the generated code using metrics like pass@k and average number of iterations required to generate correct code."

            "Problem": "Large language models can generate code snippets, but often lack the ability to provide clear explanations of how the code works, making it difficult for developers to understand and maintain the generated code.",
            "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for code generation focus primarily on generating functional code without considering the explanatory aspect.",
            "Motivation": "By prompting the model to generate code explanations along with the code itself, we can improve the interpretability and maintainability of the generated code. The model can learn to provide high-level summaries, describe the purpose of each code block, and highlight key algorithmic steps.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Code Explanation Prompting (CEP) for code generation. CEP prompts the model to generate code along with corresponding explanations. The prompts are designed to elicit clear and concise explanations at different levels of granularity. For example, the model is prompted to provide a high-level summary of the code, explain the purpose of each function or class, and describe the key algorithmic steps. The generated explanations are presented as comments within the code. The model is trained to generate code and explanations jointly, ensuring consistency between the two.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CEP on code generation benchmarks and assess the quality of the generated explanations using human evaluation. Conduct a user study with developers to measure the usefulness and clarity of the explanations in aiding code understanding and maintenance. Compare CEP with baseline methods that generate code without explanations."
