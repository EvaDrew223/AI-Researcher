            "Problem": "Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social biases and stereotypes, which can lead to harmful or unfair outputs when applied to downstream tasks.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current methods for bias reduction in LLMs include data augmentation, adversarial training, and post-processing techniques. However, these methods often require extensive computational resources or access to the model's training data.",
            "Motivation": "Counterfactual reasoning has been shown to be effective in reducing biases in human decision-making. By considering alternative scenarios and outcomes, people can identify and correct their biases. We propose to apply this concept to LLMs through counterfactual prompting.",
            "Proposed Method": "We introduce Counterfactual Prompting for Bias Reduction (CPBR), a novel prompting technique that encourages LLMs to generate unbiased outputs by considering counterfactual scenarios. Given an input prompt, CPBR generates multiple counterfactual prompts by systematically varying the sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) mentioned in the original prompt. The LLM is then prompted to generate outputs for each counterfactual prompt. By comparing the generated outputs, CPBR identifies and quantifies the model's biases. Finally, CPBR generates a bias-reduced output by aggregating the counterfactual outputs and minimizing the differences between them.",
            "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CPBR on several benchmark datasets for social bias in NLP, such as StereoSet, CrowS-Pairs, and BOLD. We will compare CPBR with existing bias reduction methods, including data augmentation and adversarial training.

            "Proposed Method": "We propose Empathy-Driven Debiasing (EDD), a novel prompting technique that encourages language models to generate empathetic and bias-free responses. EDD consists of three main steps: 1) Perspective-taking: Given an input prompt, EDD first prompts the model to generate responses from multiple perspectives, including those of marginalized groups. 2) Empathy scoring: EDD then scores each generated response based on its level of empathy, using a pre-trained empathy classifier. 3) Response selection: Finally, EDD selects the most empathetic response as the final output, while also ensuring that the selected response is bias-free. By explicitly modeling empathy in the generation process, EDD aims to produce more inclusive and sensitive outputs.",

SAP consists of three main steps: 1) Stereotype identification: Given an input prompt, SAP first identifies potential stereotypes in the prompt using a pre-trained stereotype detector. 2) Stereotype neutralization: For each identified stereotype, SAP generates a neutralized version of the prompt by replacing stereotypical terms with more neutral alternatives. 3) Neutral generation: Finally, SAP prompts the LLM to generate content based on the neutralized prompts, encouraging the model to produce stereotype-free outputs. By explicitly modeling stereotypes in the prompting process, SAP aims to reduce the generation of biased content.",

ILP consists of three main steps: 1) Inclusivity assessment: Given an input prompt, ILP first assesses the inclusivity of the prompt using a pre-trained inclusivity classifier. 2) Inclusive prompt generation: If the prompt is deemed non-inclusive, ILP generates an inclusive version of the prompt by replacing non-inclusive terms with more inclusive alternatives, using a pre-defined inclusive language dictionary. 3) Inclusive output generation: Finally, ILP prompts the language model to generate an output based on the inclusive prompt, encouraging the model to use respectful and inclusive language. By explicitly modeling inclusive language in the prompting process, ILP aims to reduce biased and offensive outputs.",

            "Proposed Method": "We propose Persona-Based Debiasing (PBD), a novel prompting technique that uses persona-based prompting to reduce biases and stereotypes in language model outputs. PBD consists of three main steps: 1) Persona generation: Given an input prompt, PBD first generates a diverse set of personas with different demographic backgrounds, using a pre-trained persona generator. 2) Persona-based prompting: For each generated persona, PBD creates a persona-specific prompt by incorporating the persona's background information into the original prompt. 3) Ensemble debiasing: Finally, PBD prompts the language model to generate outputs for each persona-specific prompt and combines the outputs using an ensemble debiasing algorithm, which aims to balance the influence of different personas and reduce the impact of individual biases. By incorporating diverse personas into the generation process, PBD aims to produce more balanced and unbiased outputs.",

It then prompts the model to generate counterfactual scenarios that challenge these biases, and to reason about how the original prompt could be rephrased to avoid perpetuating stereotypes.

It then prompts the model to generate text from alternative perspectives, such as those of underrepresented or marginalized groups. The model is encouraged to consider how the same situation or topic might be experienced differently by individuals with different backgrounds and identities.

            "Experiment Plan": "Collect a dataset of stereotypical prompts across various social categories. Apply ECD to generate debiased continuations and compare them to baselines like direct prompting. Measure the reduction in stereotypical associations using metrics like sentiment analysis and word embedding similarity."

        "Self-Diagnosis Stereotype Probing": {
            "Problem": "Language models can perpetuate harmful stereotypes when generating text, but detecting and localizing these biases remains challenging.",
            "Existing Methods": "Many bias evaluation approaches rely on externally curated datasets or prompts, which may not capture the full range of stereotypes present in the model.",
            "Motivation": "Language models have the potential to self-reflect on their own biases and stereotypical associations. By prompting models to diagnose their own outputs for signs of stereotyping, we can surface a wider range of biases and gain insights into the model's internal reasoning.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Self-Diagnosis Stereotype Probing (SDSP), a technique for uncovering stereotypical associations in language models. SDSP involves: 1) Prompting the model to generate text snippets across a wide range of topics and contexts. 2) Prompting the model to analyze each generated snippet and identify any stereotypical content or biased assumptions. 3) Aggregating the model's self-diagnoses to surface recurring patterns of stereotyping. 4) Prompting the model to suggest corrections or reframings for the identified biases.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Apply SDSP to popular language models and analyze the types of stereotypes surfaced in the self-diagnoses. Compare the coverage and diversity of biases identified through SDSP versus existing bias benchmarks. Evaluate the quality of the model's suggested corrections through human ratings."

        "Persona-Agnostic Generation": {
            "Problem": "Language models can exhibit persona-specific biases, generating text that reflects stereotypes about particular social groups.",
            "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to persona-based text generation often rely on predefined persona attributes, which can introduce or amplify biases.",
            "Motivation": "To generate text that is truly equitable and inclusive, language models should be able to produce persona-agnostic outputs that do not make assumptions about individuals based on their social group memberships. By disentangling persona attributes from the generation process, we can mitigate the impact of stereotypes.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Persona-Agnostic Generation (PAG), a framework for generating text that is neutral with respect to persona attributes. PAG involves: 1) Training a persona classifier to detect references to social group memberships (e.g., gender, race, age) in text. 2) Prompting the language model to generate text continuations for a given input. 3) Applying the persona classifier to the generated text and computing a persona specificity score. 4) Iteratively modifying the prompt using techniques like counterfactual augmentation or adversarial filtering until the generated text achieves a target level of persona agnosticism.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Collect a dataset of prompts covering a range of personas and topics. Apply PAG to generate persona-agnostic continuations and compare them to baselines like direct prompting. Measure the reduction in persona specificity using the trained classifier. Conduct human evaluations to assess the coherence and neutrality of the generated text."

        "Counterfactual Fairness Probing": {
            "Problem": "Language models can encode and perpetuate unfair associations between social groups and outcomes, leading to biased predictions in downstream tasks.",
            "Existing Methods": "Many bias evaluation approaches focus on detecting stereotypical associations but do not directly measure the fairness of model predictions across groups.",
            "Motivation": "To assess and mitigate unfairness in language model predictions, we need evaluation frameworks that directly probe for disparities in outcomes across social groups. By generating counterfactual test cases that vary sensitive attributes, we can isolate the effect of group membership on model outputs.",
            "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Fairness Probing (CFP), a framework for measuring and mitigating unfairness in language model predictions. CFP involves: 1) Defining a set of sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race) and target outcomes (e.g., predicted sentiment, toxicity score) relevant to a given task. 2) Generating counterfactual test cases by varying the sensitive attributes in an input prompt while holding other factors constant. 3) Prompting the language model to predict the target outcome for each counterfactual case. 4) Measuring disparities in predicted outcomes across groups and computing fairness metrics like demographic parity.",
            "Experiment Plan": "Apply CFP to popular language models across tasks like sentiment analysis, toxicity detection, and content moderation. Compare the fairness gaps revealed by CFP to those detected by existing bias benchmarks. Develop debiasing techniques that equalize outcomes across counterfactual groups and evaluate their effectiveness using CFP."
