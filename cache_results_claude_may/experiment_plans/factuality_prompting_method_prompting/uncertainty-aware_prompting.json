        "Problem": "Large language models can generate overconfident or misleading outputs when prompted with ambiguous or uncertain inputs, leading to hallucination and factual inaccuracies.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for reducing hallucination in the presence of uncertainty include using calibrated confidence scores, incorporating uncertainty estimates into the decoding process, or using uncertainty-aware training objectives.",
        "Motivation": "We hypothesize that large language models can be prompted to express uncertainty and generate more calibrated outputs, if given appropriate instructions and uncertainty-aware prompts. By explicitly prompting the model to reason about its own uncertainty and express it in the generated output, we can encourage the model to generate more factually accurate and calibrated responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompting, a novel prompting approach to reduce hallucination and improve calibration in the presence of uncertain inputs. First, we prompt the model to generate an initial output given the input context. Second, we prompt the model to reason about its own uncertainty and express it in the form of calibrated confidence scores or natural language expressions of uncertainty (e.g., \"I'm not sure, but...\", \"This is just a guess, but...\"). Third, we prompt the model to revise its initial output to incorporate the expressed uncertainty and generate a more calibrated final output.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our proposed method on benchmarks that test for calibration and uncertainty awareness, such as the Uncertain Natural Language Inference task and the Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers benchmark. We will compare our method with baseline prompting approaches without uncertainty awareness, as well as state-of-the-art methods for improving calibration and reducing overconfidence. We will also analyze the quality and accuracy of the expressed uncertainty in the generated outputs."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting for Reducing Hallucination in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate overconfident or misleading outputs when prompted with ambiguous or uncertain inputs, leading to hallucination and factual inaccuracies.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for reducing hallucination in the presence of uncertainty, such as using calibrated confidence scores, incorporating uncertainty estimates into the decoding process, or using uncertainty-aware training objectives, often require modifying the model architecture or training process. We hypothesize that large language models can be prompted to express uncertainty and generate more calibrated outputs, if given appropriate instructions and uncertainty-aware prompts, without the need for modifying the model itself. By explicitly prompting the model to reason about its own uncertainty and express it in the generated output, we can encourage the model to generate more factually accurate and calibrated responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompting, a novel prompting approach to reduce hallucination and improve calibration in the presence of uncertain inputs. The method consists of three main steps:\n1. Generate Initial Output: Prompt the model to generate an initial output given the input context.\n2. Express Uncertainty: Prompt the model to reason about its own uncertainty and express it in the form of calibrated confidence scores or natural language expressions of uncertainty (e.g., \"I'm not sure, but...\", \"This is just a guess, but...\").\n3. Revise Output: Prompt the model to revise its initial output to incorporate the expressed uncertainty and generate a more calibrated final output.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate our proposed method on benchmarks that test for calibration and uncertainty awareness, such as the Uncertain Natural Language Inference (UNLI) dataset and the Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers (CaPT) benchmark. These datasets contain examples with varying levels of uncertainty and ambiguity, and provide ground-truth labels for the expected level of uncertainty in the model's output.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We will design a set of prompts for each step of the Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method:\n1. Initial Output Prompts: These prompts will be used to generate the initial output given the input context. For example, for the UNLI dataset, the prompt could be: \"Given the premise '{premise}', is the hypothesis '{hypothesis}' entailed, contradicted, or neutral?\"\n2. Uncertainty Expression Prompts: These prompts will be used to encourage the model to express its uncertainty about the initial output. For example: \"How confident are you in your previous answer? Please provide a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 0 means not confident at all and 1 means very confident. If you are not sure, you can also express your uncertainty in natural language.\"\n3. Output Revision Prompts: These prompts will be used to revise the initial output based on the expressed uncertainty. For example: \"Given your initial answer '{initial_answer}' and your expressed uncertainty '{uncertainty_expression}', please revise your answer to be more calibrated and factually accurate.\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will evaluate the proposed method on state-of-the-art pre-trained language models such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. These models have shown strong performance on a wide range of natural language tasks, but are still prone to hallucination and overconfidence.",
            "Step 4: Run Experiments": "For each dataset and model combination, we will run the following experiments:\n1. Baseline: We will prompt the model to generate outputs directly without any uncertainty-aware prompting, using the Initial Output Prompts.\n2. Uncertainty-Aware Prompting: We will apply the full Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method, using the Initial Output Prompts, Uncertainty Expression Prompts, and Output Revision Prompts in sequence.\n3. Ablations: To understand the contribution of each step in the Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method, we will run ablation experiments where we skip either the Uncertainty Expression step or the Output Revision step.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Results": "We will evaluate the generated outputs from each experiment using the following metrics:\n1. Calibration: We will measure the calibration of the model's outputs using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). These metrics quantify how well the model's confidence scores align with its accuracy.\n2. Uncertainty Alignment: We will assess how well the model's expressed uncertainty aligns with the true level of uncertainty in the input, using metrics such as the Uncertainty Alignment Score (UAS) proposed in the UNLI benchmark.\n3. Factual Accuracy: We will measure the factual accuracy of the model's outputs using dataset-specific metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, or BLEU score.\nWe will compare the performance of the Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method with the baseline and ablation experiments to determine if our proposed method improves calibration, uncertainty alignment, and factual accuracy.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "We will analyze the results of the experiments to gain insights into the effectiveness of Uncertainty-Aware Prompting for reducing hallucination and improving calibration. We will aim to answer the following questions:\n1. Does Uncertainty-Aware Prompting improve calibration and uncertainty alignment compared to the baseline?\n2. Which step of the Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method (Uncertainty Expression or Output Revision) contributes more to the improvement in calibration and uncertainty alignment?\n3. How does the effectiveness of Uncertainty-Aware Prompting vary across different models and datasets?\n4. Are there any common patterns or characteristics in the examples where Uncertainty-Aware Prompting succeeds or fails?\nBased on the analysis, we will discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed method and suggest potential directions for future research."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Input": "Premise: John is a student at a prestigious university. He has always been a top performer in his class. Hypothesis: John will get a high-paying job after graduation.",
                "Baseline Output": "Entailment. Based on the information provided, it is highly likely that John will get a high-paying job after graduation, given his strong academic performance at a prestigious university.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Initial": "Entailment. Based on the information provided, it is highly likely that John will get a high-paying job after graduation, given his strong academic performance at a prestigious university.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Uncertainty Expression": "I'm not very confident in my previous answer. While John's academic performance and university reputation are positive indicators, there are many other factors that can influence job prospects and salary. My confidence score is 0.6.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Revised": "Neutral. While John's strong academic performance at a prestigious university is a positive factor, it does not necessarily guarantee a high-paying job after graduation. Other factors such as job market conditions, John's field of study, and his interview performance can also play a significant role in determining his job prospects and salary. So I cannot say with high confidence that the hypothesis is definitely entailed by the premise."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Input": "Premise: Amy is considering buying a new car. She has been researching electric vehicles and is interested in their potential environmental benefits. Hypothesis: Amy will buy an electric car.",
                "Baseline Output": "Entailment. Given Amy's interest in electric vehicles and their environmental benefits, it is likely that she will choose to buy an electric car.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Initial": "Entailment. Given Amy's interest in electric vehicles and their environmental benefits, it is likely that she will choose to buy an electric car.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Uncertainty Expression": "I'm quite uncertain about my previous answer. While Amy is interested in electric vehicles, the information provided does not definitively state that she will buy one. There could be other factors influencing her decision, such as cost, availability of charging infrastructure, or personal preferences. My confidence score is 0.4.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Revised": "Neutral. Although Amy is interested in electric vehicles and is considering their environmental benefits, this does not necessarily mean she will definitely buy an electric car. Factors such as cost, availability of suitable models, and charging infrastructure near her home or work could also influence her decision. More information would be needed to make a confident prediction. The hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise."
            },
            "Explanation": "In both examples, the baseline model generates overconfident outputs that assume the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, without considering the uncertainty and ambiguity in the input. The Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method, on the other hand, encourages the model to express its uncertainty and revise its initial output to be more calibrated and factually accurate. In the first example, the model revises its output from 'Entailment' to 'Neutral' after acknowledging the uncertainty and considering other factors that can influence job prospects. In the second example, the model changes its output from 'Entailment' to 'Neutral' after recognizing that Amy's interest in electric vehicles does not necessarily imply she will buy one, and that other factors could affect her decision. These examples demonstrate how Uncertainty-Aware Prompting can help reduce hallucination and generate more calibrated and nuanced outputs in the presence of uncertain inputs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method does not significantly improve calibration and uncertainty alignment compared to the baseline, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated uncertainty expressions to understand if the model is accurately capturing and conveying its uncertainty. If the uncertainty expressions are not well-calibrated or informative, we can explore alternative prompts or techniques to elicit more meaningful uncertainty estimates from the model.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt formulations on the effectiveness of Uncertainty-Aware Prompting. We can experiment with variations in the prompts used for each step of the method to identify the most effective way to encourage the model to express and incorporate uncertainty.\n3. Explore the use of external knowledge sources or retrieval-based methods to provide additional context and reduce uncertainty in the model's outputs. By augmenting the input with relevant information from reliable sources, we may be able to improve the model's confidence and accuracy.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify common patterns or characteristics of the examples where Uncertainty-Aware Prompting fails to improve calibration or reduce hallucination. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the proposed method and guide the development of alternative approaches.\n5. If the proposed method does not yield significant improvements, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the factors that contribute to overconfidence and hallucination in large language models. By conducting controlled experiments and ablation studies, we can investigate the impact of different model architectures, training objectives, and decoding strategies on the model's calibration and uncertainty awareness. This analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the challenges in reducing hallucination in large language models and inform future research directions."

This issue can be mitigated by having the LM verbally convey the probability that its claims are correct, but existing models cannot produce text with calibrated confidence statements. Through the lens of decision-making, we formalize linguistic calibration for long-form generations: an LM is linguistically calibrated if its generations enable its users to make calibrated probabilistic predictions. This definition enables a training framework where a supervised finetuning step bootstraps an LM to emit long-form generations with confidence statements such as\"I estimate a 30% chance of...\"or\"I am certain that...\", followed by a reinforcement learning step which rewards generations that enable a user to provide calibrated answers to related questions. We linguistically calibrate Llama 2 7B and find in automated and human evaluations of long-form generations that it is significantly more calibrated than strong finetuned factuality baselines with comparable accuracy. These findings generalize under distribution shift on question-answering and under a significant task shift to person biography generation. Our results demonstrate that long-form generations may be calibrated end-to-end by constructing an objective in the space of the predictions that users make in downstream decision-making.",

In this work, we investigate how LMs incorporate confidence about their responses via natural language and how downstream users behave in response to LM-articulated uncertainties. We examine publicly deployed models and find that LMs are unable to express uncertainties when answering questions even when they produce incorrect responses. LMs can be explicitly prompted to express confidences, but tend to be overconfident, resulting in high error rates (on average 47%) among confident responses. We test the risks of LM overconfidence by running human experiments and show that users rely heavily on LM generations, whether or not they are marked by certainty. Lastly, we investigate the preference-annotated datasets used in RLHF alignment and find that humans have a bias against texts with uncertainty. Our work highlights a new set of safety harms facing human-LM interactions and proposes design recommendations and mitigating strategies moving forward.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, large-scale language models (LLMs) have gained attention for their impressive text generation capabilities. However, these models often face the challenge of\"hallucination,\"which undermines their reliability. In this study, we introduce an uncertainty-aware in-context learning framework to empower the model to enhance or reject its output in response to uncertainty. Human-defined methods for estimating uncertainty typically assume that\"uncertainty is lower when the model's response is correct compared to when it is incorrect.\"However, setting a precise threshold to distinguish correctness is challenging. Therefore, we introduce uncertainty information as an intermediary variable that implicitly influences the model's behavior. Our innovative uncertainty-aware in-context learning framework involves fine-tuning the LLM using a calibration dataset. Our aim is to improve the model's responses by filtering out answers with high uncertainty while considering the model's knowledge limitations. We evaluate the model's knowledge by examining multiple responses to the same question for the presence of a correct answer. When the model lacks relevant knowledge, the response should indicate that the question cannot be answered. Conversely, when the model has relevant knowledge, the response should provide the correct answer. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our framework, leading to two key findings. First, the logit output values of the LLM partly reflect inherent uncertainty. Second, our model autonomously recognizes uncertainty, resulting in improved responses.",

Recent studies have shown that unsupervised pre-training produces large language models (LMs) whose conditional probabilities are remarkably well-calibrated. However, the most widely-used LMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF-LMs), and some studies have suggested that RLHF-LMs produce conditional probabilities that are very poorly calibrated. In light of this perceived weakness, we conduct a broad evaluation of methods for extracting confidence scores from RLHF-LMs. For RLHF-LMs such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Claude, we find that verbalized confidences emitted as output tokens are typically better-calibrated than the model's conditional probabilities on the TriviaQA, SciQ, and TruthfulQA benchmarks, often reducing the expected calibration error by a relative 50%.",

While it is now common sense that LLM performances are greatly impacted by prompts, the confidence calibration in prompting LLMs has yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we explore how different prompting strategies influence LLM confidence calibration and how it could be improved. We conduct extensive experiments on six prompting methods in the question-answering context and we observe that, while these methods help improve the expected LLM calibration, they also trigger LLMs to be over-confident when responding to some instances. Inspired by human cognition, we propose Fact-and-Reflection (FaR) prompting, which improves the LLM calibration in two steps. First, FaR elicits the known\"facts\"that are relevant to the input prompt from the LLM. And then it asks the model to\"reflect\"over them to generate the final answer. Experiments show that FaR prompting achieves significantly better calibration; it lowers the Expected Calibration Error by 23.5% on our multi-purpose QA tasks. Notably, FaR prompting even elicits the capability of verbally expressing concerns in less confident scenarios, which helps trigger retrieval augmentation for solving these harder instances.",

            "abstract": "Confidence estimation aiming to evaluate output trustability is crucial for the application of large language models (LLM), especially the black-box ones. Existing confidence estimation of LLM is typically not calibrated due to the overconfidence of LLM on its generated incorrect answers. Existing approaches addressing the overconfidence issue are hindered by a significant limitation that they merely consider the confidence of one answer generated by LLM. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm that thoroughly evaluates the trustability of multiple candidate answers to mitigate the overconfidence on incorrect answers. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce a two-step framework, which firstly instructs LLM to reflect and provide justifications for each answer, and then aggregates the justifications for comprehensive confidence estimation. This framework can be integrated with existing confidence estimation approaches for superior calibration. Experimental results on six datasets of three tasks demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

We first conduct a thoughtful empirical study on how aligned LMs differ in calibration from their pre-trained counterparts.

Then, we investigate the role of these two uncertainties on aligned LM's calibration through fine-tuning in simple synthetic alignment schemes and conclude that one reason for aligned LMs' overconfidence is the conflation of these two types of uncertainty.

In many practical applications, such as medical diagnosis and troubleshooting, the information needed to solve the task is not initially given, and has to be actively sought by asking follow-up questions (for example, a doctor asking a patient for more details about their symptoms). In this work, we introduce Uncertainty of Thoughts (UoT), an algorithm to augment large language models with the ability to actively seek information by asking effective questions. UoT combines 1) an uncertainty-aware simulation approach which enables the model to simulate possible future scenarios and how likely they are to occur, 2) uncertainty-based rewards motivated by information gain which incentivizes the model to seek information, and 3) a reward propagation scheme to select the optimal question to ask in a way that maximizes the expected reward. In experiments on medical diagnosis, troubleshooting and the '20 Questions' game, UoT achieves an average performance improvement of 57.8% in the rate of successful task completion across multiple LLMs compared with direct prompting, and also improves efficiency (i.e., the number of questions needed to complete the task).",

In this study, we introduce Metacognitive Prompting (MP), a strategy inspired by human introspective reasoning processes. Using MP, LLMs undergo a systematic series of structured, self-aware evaluations, drawing on both their vast inherent knowledge and new insights. We conduct extensive experiments on four prevalent LLMs: Llama2, PaLM2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, across ten natural language understanding (NLU) datasets from GLUE, SuperGLUE, BLUE, and LexGLUE benchmarks. Additionally, we compare our method with chain-of-thought prompting and its advanced versions.

Furthermore, MP consistently outperforms existing prompting methods in both general and domain-specific NLU tasks.

            "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) represent a substantial advancement in the capabilities of large language models, notably in reducing factual hallucination by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, the reliability of the retrieved information is not always guaranteed. The retrieval of irrelevant data can lead to misguided responses, and potentially causing the model to overlook its inherent knowledge, even when it possesses adequate information to address the query. Moreover, standard RALMs often struggle to assess whether they possess adequate knowledge, both intrinsic and retrieved, to provide an accurate answer. In situations where knowledge is lacking, these systems should ideally respond with\"unknown\"when the answer is unattainable. In response to these challenges, we introduces Chain-of-Noting (CoN), a novel approach aimed at improving the robustness of RALMs in facing noisy, irrelevant documents and in handling unknown scenarios. The core idea of CoN is to generate sequential reading notes for retrieved documents, enabling a thorough evaluation of their relevance to the given question and integrating this information to formulate the final answer. We employed ChatGPT to create training data for CoN, which was subsequently trained on an LLaMa-2 7B model. Our experiments across four open-domain QA benchmarks show that RALMs equipped with CoN significantly outperform standard RALMs. Notably, CoN achieves an average improvement of +7.9 in EM score given entirely noisy retrieved documents and +10.5 in rejection rates for real-time questions that fall outside the pre-training knowledge scope.",

However, optimizing LLMs to hallucinate less on these tasks is challenging, as hallucination is hard to efficiently evaluate at each optimization step. In this work, we show that reducing hallucination on a synthetic task can also reduce hallucination on real-world downstream tasks. Our method, SynTra, first designs a synthetic task where hallucinations are easy to elicit and measure. It next optimizes the LLM's system message via prefix-tuning on the synthetic task, and finally transfers the system message to realistic, hard-to-optimize tasks. Across three realistic abstractive summarization tasks, SynTra reduces hallucination for two 13B-parameter LLMs using only a synthetic retrieval task for supervision. We also find that optimizing the system message rather than the model weights can be critical; fine-tuning the entire model on the synthetic task can counterintuitively increase hallucination. Overall, SynTra demonstrates that the extra flexibility of working with synthetic data can help mitigate undesired behaviors in practice.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities out of box for a wide range of applications, yet accuracy still remains a major growth area, especially in mission-critical domains such as biomedicine. An effective method to calibrate the con\ufb01dence level on LLM responses is essential to automatically detect errors and facilitate human-in-the-loop veri\ufb01cation. An important source of calibration signals stems from expert-stipulated programmatic super-vision, which is often available at low cost but has its own limitations such as noise and coverage. In this paper, we introduce a Pareto optimal self-supervision framework that can leverage available programmatic supervision to systematically calibrate LLM responses by producing a risk score for every response, without any additional manual efforts. This is accomplished by learning a harmonizer model to align LLM output with other available supervision sources, which would assign higher risk scores to more uncertain LLM responses and facilitate error correction. Experiments on standard relation extraction tasks in biomedical and general domains demonstrate the promise of this approach, with our proposed risk scores highly correlated with the real error rate of LLMs. For the most uncertain test instances, dynamic prompting based on our proposed risk scores results in signi\ufb01cant accuracy improvement for off-the-shelf LLMs, boosting GPT-3 results past state-of-the-art (SOTA) weak supervision and GPT-4 results past SOTA supervised results on challenging evaluation datasets.",

            "abstract": "As large language models attract increasing attention and find widespread application, concurrent challenges of reliability also arise at the same time. Confidence calibration, an effective analysis method for gauging the reliability of deep models, serves as a crucial tool for assessing and improving their reliability. However, such investigation has been comparatively underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic examination of the calibration of aligned language models throughout the entire construction process, including pretraining and alignment training. At each stage, we investigate how different training settings, such as parameter scales and training data, affect model calibration. To thoroughly assess model calibration, we evaluate models on three most concerned aspects: generation, factuality and understanding. Our work sheds light on whether popular LLMs are well-calibrated and how the training process influences model calibration.",

            "abstract": "Generative Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for a wide range of applications, but reducing ungrounded or erroneous responses remains a major growth area. Unlike task-specific models, there lack an effective method to calibrate the confidence level of LLM responses to indicate potential errors and facilitate human-in-the-loop verification. An important source of calibration stems from expert-stipulated programmatic supervision, which is often available at low cost but has its own limitations such as noise and coverage. In this paper, we introduce a Pareto optimal self-supervision framework that can leverage available programmatic supervision to systematically calibrate LLM responses by producing a risk score for every LLM response, without any additional manual efforts. This is accomplished by learning a harmonizer model to align with LLM output as well as other weak supervision sources. The model assigns higher risk scores to more uncertain LLM responses and facilitate error correction. Experiments on standard relation extraction and classification tasks in biomedical and general domains demonstrate that the proposed risk score is highly correlated with the actual LLM error rate. By using a dynamic prompting strategy based on the risk score, we observed significant accuracy improvement for off-the-shelf LLMs, boosting GPT-3.5 results past state-of-the-art (SOTA) weak supervision model and GPT-4 results past SOTA supervised results on challenging evaluation datasets.",

Despite their impressive performance, the models are known to pose important risks. As these models are deployed in real-world applications, a systematic understanding of different risks posed by these models on tasks such as natural language inference (NLI), is much needed. In this paper, we define and formalize two distinct types of risk: decision risk and composite risk. We also propose a risk-centric evaluation framework, and four novel metrics, for assessing LLMs on these risks in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we propose a risk-adjusted calibration method called DwD for helping LLMs minimize these risks in an overall NLI architecture. Detailed experiments, using four NLI benchmarks, three baselines and two LLMs, including ChatGPT, show both the practical utility of the evaluation framework, and the efficacy of DwD in reducing decision and composite risk. For instance, when using DwD, an underlying LLM is able to address an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks (but which the LLM erroneously deems high-risk without risk adjustment) and skip a further 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly.",

In such applications, it is imperative that we be able to estimate our confidence in the answers output by a language model in order to assess risks. Although we can easily compute the probability assigned by a language model to the sequence of tokens that make up an answer, we cannot easily compute the probability of the answer itself, which could be phrased in numerous ways.While other works have engineered ways of assigning such probabilities to LLM outputs, a key problem remains: existing language models are poorly calibrated, often confident when they are wrong or unsure when they are correct. In this work, we devise a protocol called *calibration tuning* for finetuning LLMs to output calibrated probabilities. Calibration-tuned models demonstrate superior calibration performance compared to existing language models on a variety of question-answering tasks, including open-ended generation, without affecting accuracy. We further show that this ability transfers to new domains outside of the calibration-tuning train set.",

KnowNo builds on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on task completion while minimizing human help in complex multi-step planning settings. Experiments across a variety of simulated and real robot setups that involve tasks with different modes of ambiguity (e.g., from spatial to numeric uncertainties, from human preferences to Winograd schemas) show that KnowNo performs favorably over modern baselines (which may involve ensembles or extensive prompt tuning) in terms of improving efficiency and autonomy, while providing formal assurances. KnowNo can be used with LLMs out of the box without model-finetuning, and suggests a promising lightweight approach to modeling uncertainty that can complement and scale with the growing capabilities of foundation models.

However, their application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of LVLMs.",

To remedy this dilemma, we study self-training as one of the predominant semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, which utilizes large-scale unlabeled data to generate synthetic examples. However, too many noisy labels will hurt the model performance, and the self-training procedure requires multiple training iterations making it more expensive if all the model parameters of the PLM are updated.

In this work, we make one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs. To this end, we propose two novel metrics -- $\\textit{Verbalized Uncertainty}$ and $\\textit{Probing Uncertainty}$ -- to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness. Our study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of quantifying uncertainty in LLM explanations, contributing to the broader discussion of the trustworthiness of foundation models.",

            "abstract": "Dialogue systems can leverage large pre-trained language models and knowledge to generate fluent and informative responses. However, these models are still prone to produce hallucinated responses not supported by the input source, which greatly hinders their application. The heterogeneity between external knowledge and dialogue context challenges representation learning and source integration, and further contributes to unfaithfulness. To handle this challenge and generate more faithful responses, this paper presents RHO ($\\rho$) utilizing the representations of linked entities and relation predicates from a knowledge graph (KG). We propose (1) local knowledge grounding to combine textual embeddings with the corresponding KG embeddings; and (2) global knowledge grounding to equip RHO with multi-hop reasoning abilities via the attention mechanism. In addition, we devise a response re-ranking technique based on walks over KG sub-graphs for better conversational reasoning. Experimental results on OpenDialKG show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both automatic and human evaluation by a large margin, especially in hallucination reduction (17.54% in FeQA).",

Despite recent advances, neural text summarization models are known to be susceptible to hallucinating (or more correctly confabulating), that is to produce summaries with details that are not grounded in the source document. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient technique, CoBa, to reduce hallucination in abstractive summarization. The approach is based on two steps: hallucination detection and mitigation. We show that the former can be achieved through measuring simple statistics about conditional word probabilities and distance to context words. Further, we demonstrate that straight-forward backtracking is surprisingly effective at mitigation. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed method with prior art on three benchmark datasets for text summarization. The results show that CoBa is effective and efficient in reducing hallucination, and offers great adaptability and flexibility.",

            "abstract": "For large language models (LLMs) to be trusted by humans they need to be well-calibrated in the sense that they can accurately assess and communicate how likely it is that their predictions are correct. Recent work has focused on the quality of internal LLM confidence assessments, but the question remains of how well LLMs can communicate this internal model confidence to human users. This paper explores the disparity between external human confidence in an LLM's responses and the internal confidence of the model. Through experiments involving multiple-choice questions, we systematically examine human users' ability to discern the reliability of LLM outputs. Our study focuses on two key areas: (1) assessing users' perception of true LLM confidence and (2) investigating the impact of tailored explanations on this perception. The research highlights that default explanations from LLMs often lead to user overestimation of both the model's confidence and its' accuracy. By modifying the explanations to more accurately reflect the LLM's internal confidence, we observe a significant shift in user perception, aligning it more closely with the model's actual confidence levels. This adjustment in explanatory approach demonstrates potential for enhancing user trust and accuracy in assessing LLM outputs. The findings underscore the importance of transparent communication of confidence levels in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding the reliability of AI-generated information is essential.",

For the first question, we conduct fine-grained control experiments to study the dynamic change in PLMs\u2019 calibration performance in training. We consider six factors as control variables, including dataset difficulty, available training samples, training steps, the number of tunable parameters, model scale, and pretraining. We observe a consistent change in calibration performance across six factors. We find that PLMs don\u2019t learn to become calibrated in training, evidenced by the continual increase in confidence, no matter whether the predictions are correct or not. We highlight that our finding somewhat contradicts two established conclusions: (a) Larger PLMs are more calibrated; (b) Pretraining improves model calibration. Next, we study the effectiveness of existing calibration methods in mitigating the overconfidence issue. Besides unlearnable calibration methods (e.g., label smoothing), we adapt and extend two recently proposed learnable methods that directly collect data to train models to have reasonable confidence estimations. Experimental results show that learnable methods significantly reduce PLMs\u2019 confidence in wrong predictions.",

However, this process is vulnerable to reward overoptimization or hacking, in which the responses selected have high rewards due to errors in the reward model rather than a genuine preference. This is especially problematic as the prompt or response diverges from the training data. It should be possible to mitigate these issues by training a Bayesian reward model, which signals higher uncertainty further from the training data distribution.

However, current methods significantly overfit the training data, suffering from large accuracy degradation when tested on unseen classes from the same domain. To this end, in this paper, we make the following 4 contributions: (1) To alleviate base class overfitting, we propose a novel Language- Aware Soft Prompting (LASP) learning method by means of a text-to-text cross-entropy loss that maximizes the probability of the learned prompts to be correctly classified with respect to pre-defined hand-crafted textual prompts. (2) To increase the representation capacity of the prompts, we propose grouped LASP where each group of prompts is optimized with respect to a separate subset of textual prompts. (3) We identify a visual-language misalignment introduced by prompt learning and LASP, and more importantly, propose a re-calibration mechanism to address it. (4) We show that LASP is inherently amenable to including, during training, virtual classes, i.e. class names for which no visual samples are available, further increasing the robustness of the learned prompts. Through evaluations on 11 datasets, we show that our approach (a) significantly outperforms all prior works on soft prompting, and (b) matches and surpasses, for the first time, the accuracy on novel classes obtained by hand-crafted prompts and CLIP for 8 out of 11 test datasets.

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. To comprehend and execute diverse human instructions over image data, instruction-tuned large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been introduced. However, LVLMs may suffer from different types of object hallucinations. Nevertheless, LVLMs are evaluated for coarse-grained object hallucinations only (i.e., generated objects non-existent in the input image). The fine-grained object attributes and behaviors non-existent in the image may still be generated but not measured by the current evaluation methods. In this paper, we thus focus on reducing fine-grained hallucinations of LVLMs. We propose \\textit{ReCaption}, a framework that consists of two components: rewriting captions using ChatGPT and fine-tuning the instruction-tuned LVLMs on the rewritten captions. We also propose a fine-grained probing-based evaluation method named \\textit{Fine-Grained Object Hallucination Evaluation} (\\textit{FGHE}). Our experiment results demonstrate that ReCaption effectively reduces fine-grained object hallucination for different LVLM options and improves their text generation quality.

In this paper, we systematically study the object hallucination problem from three aspects. First, we examine recent state-of-the-art VLP models, showing that they still hallucinate frequently and models achieving better scores on standard metrics (e.g., CIDEr) could be more unfaithful. Second, we investigate how different types of image encoding in VLP influence hallucination, including region-based, grid-based, and patch-based. Surprisingly, we find that patch-based features perform the best and smaller patch resolution yields a non-trivial reduction in object hallucination. Third, we decouple various VLP objectives and demonstrate that token-level image-text alignment and controlled generation are crucial to reducing hallucination. Based on that, we propose a simple yet effective VLP loss named ObjMLM to further mitigate object hallucination.

We employ a unique self-supervised loss that leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations of the generated radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling objective, to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize and align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image and the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as LLaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust against noisy images.

However, they are still plagued by the hallucination problem, causing unpredictable factual errors in the generated responses. Recently, knowledge-grounded dialogue generation models, that intentionally invoke external knowledge resources to more informative responses, are also proven to be effective in reducing hallucination. Following the idea of getting high-quality knowledge, a few efforts have achieved pretty good performance on this issue. As some inevitable knowledge noises may also lead to hallucinations, it is emergent to investigate the reason and future directions for building noise-tolerant methods in KGD tasks. In this paper, we analyze the causal story behind this problem with counterfactual reasoning methods. Based on the causal effect analysis, we propose a possible solution for alleviating the hallucination in KGD by exploiting the dialogue-knowledge interaction. Experimental results of our example implementation show that this method can reduce hallucination without disrupting other dialogue performance, while keeping adaptive to different generation models.

In this paper, we explore mixup for model calibration on several NLU tasks and propose a novel mixup strategy for pre-trained language models that improves model calibration further. Our proposed mixup is guided by both the Area Under the Margin (AUM) statistic (Pleiss et al., 2020) and the saliency map of each sample (Simonyan et al., 2013). Moreover, we combine our mixup strategy with model miscalibration correction techniques (i.e., label smoothing and temperature scaling) and provide detailed analyses of their impact on our proposed mixup. We focus on systematically designing experiments on three NLU tasks: natural language inference, paraphrase detection, and commonsense reasoning.

However, as LMs often generate incorrect or hallucinated responses, it is crucial to correctly quantify their uncertainty in responding to given inputs. In addition to verbalized confidence elicited via prompting, many uncertainty measures ($e.g.$, semantic entropy and affinity-graph-based measures) have been proposed. However, these measures can differ greatly, and it is unclear how to compare them, partly because they take values over different ranges ($e.g.$, $[0,\\infty)$ or $[0,1]$). In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel and practical framework, termed $Rank$-$Calibration$, to assess uncertainty and confidence measures for LMs. Our key tenet is that higher uncertainty (or lower confidence) should imply lower generation quality, on average. Rank-calibration quantifies deviations from this ideal relationship in a principled manner, without requiring ad hoc binary thresholding of the correctness score ($e.g.$, ROUGE or METEOR). The broad applicability and the granular interpretability of our methods are demonstrated empirically.",

In recent years, considerable efforts and resources have been devoted to adaptation methods for improving downstream performance of VLMs, particularly on parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like prompt learning. However, a crucial aspect that has been largely overlooked is the confidence calibration problem in fine-tuned VLMs, which could greatly reduce reliability when deploying such models in the real world. This paper bridges the gap by systematically investigating the confidence calibration problem in the context of prompt learning and reveals that existing calibration methods are insufficient to address the problem, especially in the open-vocabulary setting. To solve the problem, we present a simple and effective approach called Distance-Aware Calibration (DAC), which is based on scaling the temperature using as guidance the distance between predicted text labels and base classes. The experiments with 7 distinct prompt learning methods applied across 11 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAC, which achieves high efficacy without sacrificing the inference speed.",

However, despite numerous empirical researches on the combination of LLMs and game theory, the capability boundaries of LLMs in game theory remain unclear. In this research, we endeavor to systematically analyze LLMs in the context of game theory. Specifically, rationality, as the fundamental principle of game theory, serves as the metric for evaluating players' behavior --- building a clear desire, refining belief about uncertainty, and taking optimal actions. Accordingly, we select three classical games (dictator game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and ring-network game) to analyze to what extent LLMs can achieve rationality in these three aspects. The experimental results indicate that even the current state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4) exhibits substantial disparities compared to humans in game theory. For instance, LLMs struggle to build desires based on uncommon preferences, fail to refine belief from many simple patterns, and may overlook or modify refined belief when taking actions. Therefore, we consider that introducing LLMs into game experiments in the field of social science should be approached with greater caution.",

            "abstract": "The preference alignment aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate responses that conform to human values, which is essential for developing general AI systems. Ranking-based methods -- a promising class of alignment approaches -- learn human preferences from datasets containing response pairs by optimizing the log-likelihood margins between preferred and dis-preferred responses. However, due to the inherent differences in annotators' preferences, ranking labels of comparisons for response pairs are unavoidably noisy. This seriously hurts the reliability of existing ranking-based methods. To address this problem, we propose a provably noise-tolerant preference alignment method, namely RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO). To the best of our knowledge, ROPO is the first preference alignment method with noise-tolerance guarantees. The key idea of ROPO is to dynamically assign conservative gradient weights to response pairs with high label uncertainty, based on the log-likelihood margins between the responses. By effectively suppressing the gradients of noisy samples, our weighting strategy ensures that the expected risk has the same gradient direction independent of the presence and proportion of noise. Experiments on three open-ended text generation tasks with four base models ranging in size from 2.8B to 13B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing ranking-based methods.",

This paper aims to join the growing literature regarding ChatGPT's abilities by focusing on its performance in high-resource languages and on its capacity to predict its answers' accuracy by giving a confidence level. The analysis of high-resource languages is of interest as studies have shown that low-resource languages perform worse than English in NLP tasks, but no study so far has analysed whether high-resource languages perform as well as English. The analysis of ChatGPT's confidence calibration has not been carried out before either and is critical to learn about ChatGPT's trustworthiness. In order to study these two aspects, five high-resource languages and two NLP tasks were chosen. ChatGPT was asked to perform both tasks in the five languages and to give a numerical confidence value for each answer. The results show that all the selected high-resource languages perform similarly and that ChatGPT does not have a good confidence calibration, often being overconfident and never giving low confidence values.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, camo-perceptive vision-language framework (CPVLF), to explore whether LVLM can generalize to the challenging camouflaged object detection (COD) scenario in a training-free manner. During the process of generalization, we find that due to hallucination issues within LVLM, it can erroneously perceive objects in camouflaged scenes, producing counterfactual concepts. Moreover, as LVLM is not specifically trained for the precise localization of camouflaged objects, it exhibits a degree of uncertainty in accurately pinpointing these objects. Therefore, we propose chain of visual perception, which enhances LVLM's perception of camouflaged scenes from both linguistic and visual perspectives, reducing the hallucination issue and improving its capability in accurately locating camouflaged objects. We validate the effectiveness of CPVLF on three widely used COD datasets, and the experiments show the potential of LVLM in the COD task.",

Combined with offline and runtime compression, this only requires 127GB of disk space for encoding 3 billion tokens in Wikipedia.

Firstly, we reveal that quantization with GPTQ to 4-bit results in a decrease in confidence regarding true labels, with varying impacts observed among different language models. Secondly, we observe fluctuations in the impact on confidence across different scales.

            "abstract": "Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the most popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a very common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a small set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provides a rank-set -- a set of possible ranking positions -- for each of the models under comparison. Moreover, it guarantees that, with a probability greater than or equal to a user-specified value, the rank-sets cover the true ranking consistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences. Our framework is computationally efficient, easy to use, and does not make any assumption about the distribution of human preferences nor about the degree of alignment between the pairwise comparisons by the humans and the strong large language model.",

The noise that originates from the feature extraction process can cause poor performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model dubbed the Piecewise Convolutional Neural Networks (PCNNs) with multi-instance learning to address these two problems. To solve the first problem, distant supervised relation extraction is treated as a multi-instance problem in which the uncertainty of instance labels is taken into account.

However, there are still two unsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model training are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users tested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features. Second, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions. Clinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the uncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an ensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19 detection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data. As such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling and down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from the disagreement across multiple models. It is shown that false predictions often yield higher uncertainty, enabling us to suggest the users with certainty higher than a threshold to repeat the audio test on their phones or to take clinical tests if digital diagnosis still fails. This study paves the way for a more robust sound-based COVID-19 automated screening system. Copyright \u00a9 2021 ISCA.",

            "abstract": "While large language models excel in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, to perform well on spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks, they must either rely on off-the-shelf automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for transcription, or be equipped with an in-built speech modality. This work focuses on the former scenario, where LLM's accuracy on SLU tasks is constrained by the accuracy of a fixed ASR system on the spoken input. Specifically, we tackle speech-intent classification task, where a high word-error-rate can limit the LLM's ability to understand the spoken intent. Instead of chasing a high accuracy by designing complex or specialized architectures regardless of deployment costs, we seek to answer how far we can go without substantially changing the underlying ASR and LLM, which can potentially be shared by multiple unrelated tasks. To this end, we propose prompting the LLM with an n-best list of ASR hypotheses instead of only the error-prone 1-best hypothesis. We explore prompt-engineering to explain the concept of n-best lists to the LLM; followed by the finetuning of Low-Rank Adapters on the downstream tasks. Our approach using n-best lists proves to be effective on a device-directed speech detection task as well as on a keyword spotting task, where systems using n-best list prompts outperform those using 1-best ASR hypothesis; thus paving the way for an efficient method to exploit ASR uncertainty via LLMs for speech-based applications.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have gained substantial attentions on their capability to generate human-like responses. Though exhibiting a promising future for various applications such as conversation AI, these LMs face deployment challenges on various devices due to their extreme computational cost and unpredictable inference latency. Such varied inference latency, identified as a consequence of uncertainty intrinsic to the nature of language, can lead to computational inefficiency and degrade the overall performance of LMs, especially under high-traffic workloads. Unfortunately, the bandwidth of these uncertainty sources is extensive, complicating the prediction of latency and the effects emanating from such uncertainties. To understand and mitigate the impact of uncertainty on real-time response-demanding systems, we take the first step to comprehend, quantify and optimize these uncertainty-induced latency performance variations in LMs. Specifically, we present RT-LM, an uncertainty-aware resource management ecosystem for real-time inference of LMs. RT-LM innovatively quantifies how specific input uncertainties, recognized within the NLP community, adversely affect latency, often leading to an increased output length. Exploiting these insights, we devise a lightweight yet effective method to dynamically correlate input text uncertainties with output length at runtime. Utilizing this quantification as a latency heuristic, we integrate the uncertainty information into a system-level scheduler which explores several uncertainty-induced optimization opportunities, including uncertainty-aware prioritization, dynamic consolidation, and strategic CPU offloading. Quantitative experiments across five state-of-the-art LMs on two hardware platforms demonstrates that RT-LM can significantly reduce the average response time and improve throughput while incurring a rather small runtime overhead.",

As an alternative, the current approach involves training the prompt rather than the LLM. In this study, we developed a model that utilizes the ID vectors of user and item inputs as prompts for GPT-2. We employed a joint training mechanism within a multi-task learning framework to optimize both the recommendation task and explanation task. This strategy enables a more effective exploration of users' interests, improving recommendation effectiveness and user satisfaction. Through the experiments, our method achieving 1.59 DIV, 0.57 USR and 0.41 FCR on the Yelp, TripAdvisor and Amazon dataset respectively, demonstrates superior performance over four SOTA methods in terms of explainability evaluation metric.

Similarly to their NLP counterparts, V&L models can be adapted to a downstream task by learning soft continuous prompts using a few training examples. Current methods learn the soft prompts by minimizing a cross-entropy loss using as class weights the features obtained by passing the prompts plus the class names through the text encoder. Such methods, however, signi\ufb01cantly over\ufb01t the training data suffering from large accuracy degradation when tested on unseen classes from the same domain. Our main contribution, in this paper, is a surprisingly simple approach to alleviate this problem: we use a second cross entropy loss to minimize the distance between the learned soft prompts and a set of hand-engineered manual prompts (obtained by prompt engineering). The proposed loss can be interpreted in multiple ways including as a regularizer, as a means for language-based augmentation, and as a way of learning more discriminative class centroids. Importantly, our formulation is inherently amenable to including, during training, virtual classes, i.e. class names for which no visual samples are available, further increasing the robustness of the learned prompts. Through extensive evaluations on 11 datasets, we show that our approach (a) signi\ufb01cantly outperforms all prior works on soft prompting, and (b) matches and surpasses, for the \ufb01rst time, the accuracy on novel classes obtained by hand-crafted prompts and CLIP for the majority of the test datasets.

In this work, we present a new framework for dense prediction by implicitly and explicitly leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from CLIP.

By further using the contextual information from the image to prompt the language model, we are able to facilitate our model to better exploit the pretrained knowledge. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to arbitrary dense prediction systems and various pre-trained visual backbones including both CLIP models and ImageNet pre-trained models.

While reducing hallucination is crucial and non-negligible for daily and critical uses of LLMs, we propose that in the current landscape in which these LLMs still hallucinate, it is possible, in fact, to exploit hallucination to increase performance in performing tasks compared to standard zero-shot prompting. Experiments with eight LLMs show improvements in performance across the majority of eight datasets, including reading comprehension, arithmetic reasoning, and closed-book question answering. The observed inconsistency in increased relative performance across the LLMs also potentially indicates a different degree of inherent hallucination in each model. These differences show that it is possible to utilize null-shot prompting as a way to detect degrees of hallucination in LLMs using existing benchmarking datasets. We also perform ablation studies, including experimenting with a modified version of null-shot prompting that incorporates ideas from zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which shows different trends of results.",

In this paper, we devise a novel Active Learning (AL) framework for neural EA, aiming to create highly informative seed alignment to obtain more effective EA models with less annotation cost. Our framework tackles two main challenges encountered when applying AL to EA: (1) How to exploit dependencies between entities within the AL strategy. Most AL strategies assume that the data instances to sample are independent and identically distributed. However, entities in KGs are related. To address this challenge, we propose a structure-aware uncertainty sampling strategy that can measure the uncertainty of each entity as well as its impact on its neighbour entities in the KG. (2) How to recognise entities that appear in one KG but not in the other KG (i.e., bachelors). Identifying bachelors would likely save annotation budget. To address this challenge, we devise a bachelor recognizer paying attention to alleviate the effect of sampling bias. Empirical results show that our proposed AL strategy can significantly improve sampling quality with good generality across different datasets, EA models and amount of bachelors.",

We employ digit-specific HMMs to segment the utterances into digits, to perform frame alignment to HMM states and to extract Baum-Welch statistics. By making use of the natural partition of input features into digits, we train digit-specific i-vector extractors on top of each HMM and we extract well-localized i-vectors, each modelling merely the phonetic content corresponding to a single digit. We then examine ways to perform channel and uncertainty compensation, and we propose a novel method for using the uncertainty in the i-vector estimates. The experiments on RSR2015 part III show that the proposed method attains 1.52% and 1.77% Equal Error Rate (EER) for male and female respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as x-vectors, trained on vast amounts of data. Furthermore, these results are attained by a single system trained entirely on RSR2015, and by a simple score-normalized cosine distance. Moreover, we show that the omission of channel compensation yields only a minor degradation in performance, meaning that the system attains state-of-the-art results even without recordings from multiple handsets per speaker for training or enrolment. Similar conclusions are drawn from our experiments on the RedDots corpus, where the same method is evaluated on phrases.

            "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress in natural language understanding with pretrained Transformers, neural language models often do not handle commonsense knowledge well. Toward commonsense-aware models, there have been attempts to obtain knowledge, ranging from automatic acquisition to crowdsourcing. However, it is difficult to obtain a high-quality knowledge base at a low cost, especially from scratch. In this paper, we propose PHALM, a method of building a knowledge graph from scratch, by prompting both crowdworkers and a large language model (LLM). We used this method to build a Japanese event knowledge graph and trained Japanese commonsense generation models. Experimental results revealed the acceptability of the built graph and inferences generated by the trained models. We also report the difference in prompting humans and an LLM. Our code, data, and models are available at github.com/nlp-waseda/comet-atomic-ja.",

            "abstract": "Planning and control for uncertain contact systems is challenging as it is not clear how to propagate uncertainty for planning. We use a particle \ufb01lter-based approach to propagate moments for stochastic complementarity system. To circumvent the issues of open-loop chance constrained planning, we propose a contact-aware controller for covariance steering of the complementarity system. Our optimization problem is formulated as Non-Linear Programming (NLP) using bilevel optimization. We verify that our contact-aware controller is able to steer the covariance of the states for stochastic contact-rich tasks",

            "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented in-context learning has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing knowledge-intensive tasks using frozen language models (LM) and retrieval models (RM). Existing work has combined these in simple\"retrieve-then-read\"pipelines in which the RM retrieves passages that are inserted into the LM prompt. To begin to fully realize the potential of frozen LMs and RMs, we propose Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP), a framework that relies on passing natural language texts in sophisticated pipelines between an LM and an RM. DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded predictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations that the LM and RM can handle more reliably. We have written novel DSP programs for answering questions in open-domain, multi-hop, and conversational settings, establishing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-context learning results and delivering 37-120%, 8-39%, and 80-290% relative gains against the vanilla LM (GPT-3.5), a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline, and a contemporaneous self-ask pipeline, respectively. We release DSP at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dsp",

            "abstract": "Is there a unified model for generating molecules considering different conditions, such as binding pockets and chemical properties? Although target-aware generative models have made significant advances in drug design, they do not consider chemistry conditions and cannot guarantee the desired chemical properties. Unfortunately, merging the target-aware and chemical-aware models into a unified model to meet customized requirements may lead to the problem of negative transfer. Inspired by the success of multi-task learning in the NLP area, we use prefix embeddings to provide a novel generative model that considers both the targeted pocket's circumstances and a variety of chemical properties. All conditional information is represented as learnable features, which the generative model subsequently employs as a contextual prompt. Experiments show that our model exhibits good controllability in both single and multi-conditional molecular generation. The controllability enables us to outperform previous structure-based drug design methods. More interestingly, we open up the attention mechanism and reveal coupling relationships between conditions, providing guidance for multi-conditional molecule generation.",
