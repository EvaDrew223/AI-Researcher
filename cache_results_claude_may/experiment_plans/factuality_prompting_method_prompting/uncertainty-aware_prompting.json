        "Problem": "Large language models can generate overconfident or misleading outputs when prompted with ambiguous or uncertain inputs, leading to hallucination and factual inaccuracies.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for reducing hallucination in the presence of uncertainty include using calibrated confidence scores, incorporating uncertainty estimates into the decoding process, or using uncertainty-aware training objectives.",
        "Motivation": "We hypothesize that large language models can be prompted to express uncertainty and generate more calibrated outputs, if given appropriate instructions and uncertainty-aware prompts. By explicitly prompting the model to reason about its own uncertainty and express it in the generated output, we can encourage the model to generate more factually accurate and calibrated responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompting, a novel prompting approach to reduce hallucination and improve calibration in the presence of uncertain inputs. First, we prompt the model to generate an initial output given the input context. Second, we prompt the model to reason about its own uncertainty and express it in the form of calibrated confidence scores or natural language expressions of uncertainty (e.g., \"I'm not sure, but...\", \"This is just a guess, but...\"). Third, we prompt the model to revise its initial output to incorporate the expressed uncertainty and generate a more calibrated final output.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our proposed method on benchmarks that test for calibration and uncertainty awareness, such as the Uncertain Natural Language Inference task and the Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers benchmark. We will compare our method with baseline prompting approaches without uncertainty awareness, as well as state-of-the-art methods for improving calibration and reducing overconfidence. We will also analyze the quality and accuracy of the expressed uncertainty in the generated outputs."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting for Reducing Hallucination in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate overconfident or misleading outputs when prompted with ambiguous or uncertain inputs, leading to hallucination and factual inaccuracies.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for reducing hallucination in the presence of uncertainty, such as using calibrated confidence scores, incorporating uncertainty estimates into the decoding process, or using uncertainty-aware training objectives, often require modifying the model architecture or training process. We hypothesize that large language models can be prompted to express uncertainty and generate more calibrated outputs, if given appropriate instructions and uncertainty-aware prompts, without the need for modifying the model itself. By explicitly prompting the model to reason about its own uncertainty and express it in the generated output, we can encourage the model to generate more factually accurate and calibrated responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompting, a novel prompting approach to reduce hallucination and improve calibration in the presence of uncertain inputs. The method consists of three main steps:\n1. Generate Initial Output: Prompt the model to generate an initial output given the input context.\n2. Express Uncertainty: Prompt the model to reason about its own uncertainty and express it in the form of calibrated confidence scores or natural language expressions of uncertainty (e.g., \"I'm not sure, but...\", \"This is just a guess, but...\").\n3. Revise Output: Prompt the model to revise its initial output to incorporate the expressed uncertainty and generate a more calibrated final output.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate our proposed method on benchmarks that test for calibration and uncertainty awareness, such as the Uncertain Natural Language Inference (UNLI) dataset and the Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers (CaPT) benchmark. These datasets contain examples with varying levels of uncertainty and ambiguity, and provide ground-truth labels for the expected level of uncertainty in the model's output.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We will design a set of prompts for each step of the Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method:\n1. Initial Output Prompts: These prompts will be used to generate the initial output given the input context. For example, for the UNLI dataset, the prompt could be: \"Given the premise '{premise}', is the hypothesis '{hypothesis}' entailed, contradicted, or neutral?\"\n2. Uncertainty Expression Prompts: These prompts will be used to encourage the model to express its uncertainty about the initial output. For example: \"How confident are you in your previous answer? Please provide a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 0 means not confident at all and 1 means very confident. If you are not sure, you can also express your uncertainty in natural language.\"\n3. Output Revision Prompts: These prompts will be used to revise the initial output based on the expressed uncertainty. For example: \"Given your initial answer '{initial_answer}' and your expressed uncertainty '{uncertainty_expression}', please revise your answer to be more calibrated and factually accurate.\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will evaluate the proposed method on state-of-the-art pre-trained language models such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. These models have shown strong performance on a wide range of natural language tasks, but are still prone to hallucination and overconfidence.",
            "Step 4: Run Experiments": "For each dataset and model combination, we will run the following experiments:\n1. Baseline: We will prompt the model to generate outputs directly without any uncertainty-aware prompting, using the Initial Output Prompts.\n2. Uncertainty-Aware Prompting: We will apply the full Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method, using the Initial Output Prompts, Uncertainty Expression Prompts, and Output Revision Prompts in sequence.\n3. Ablations: To understand the contribution of each step in the Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method, we will run ablation experiments where we skip either the Uncertainty Expression step or the Output Revision step.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Results": "We will evaluate the generated outputs from each experiment using the following metrics:\n1. Calibration: We will measure the calibration of the model's outputs using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). These metrics quantify how well the model's confidence scores align with its accuracy.\n2. Uncertainty Alignment: We will assess how well the model's expressed uncertainty aligns with the true level of uncertainty in the input, using metrics such as the Uncertainty Alignment Score (UAS) proposed in the UNLI benchmark.\n3. Factual Accuracy: We will measure the factual accuracy of the model's outputs using dataset-specific metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, or BLEU score.\nWe will compare the performance of the Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method with the baseline and ablation experiments to determine if our proposed method improves calibration, uncertainty alignment, and factual accuracy.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "We will analyze the results of the experiments to gain insights into the effectiveness of Uncertainty-Aware Prompting for reducing hallucination and improving calibration. We will aim to answer the following questions:\n1. Does Uncertainty-Aware Prompting improve calibration and uncertainty alignment compared to the baseline?\n2. Which step of the Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method (Uncertainty Expression or Output Revision) contributes more to the improvement in calibration and uncertainty alignment?\n3. How does the effectiveness of Uncertainty-Aware Prompting vary across different models and datasets?\n4. Are there any common patterns or characteristics in the examples where Uncertainty-Aware Prompting succeeds or fails?\nBased on the analysis, we will discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed method and suggest potential directions for future research."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Input": "Premise: John is a student at a prestigious university. He has always been a top performer in his class. Hypothesis: John will get a high-paying job after graduation.",
                "Baseline Output": "Entailment. Based on the information provided, it is highly likely that John will get a high-paying job after graduation, given his strong academic performance at a prestigious university.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Initial": "Entailment. Based on the information provided, it is highly likely that John will get a high-paying job after graduation, given his strong academic performance at a prestigious university.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Uncertainty Expression": "I'm not very confident in my previous answer. While John's academic performance and university reputation are positive indicators, there are many other factors that can influence job prospects and salary. My confidence score is 0.6.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Revised": "Neutral. While John's strong academic performance at a prestigious university is a positive factor, it does not necessarily guarantee a high-paying job after graduation. Other factors such as job market conditions, John's field of study, and his interview performance can also play a significant role in determining his job prospects and salary. So I cannot say with high confidence that the hypothesis is definitely entailed by the premise."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Input": "Premise: Amy is considering buying a new car. She has been researching electric vehicles and is interested in their potential environmental benefits. Hypothesis: Amy will buy an electric car.",
                "Baseline Output": "Entailment. Given Amy's interest in electric vehicles and their environmental benefits, it is likely that she will choose to buy an electric car.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Initial": "Entailment. Given Amy's interest in electric vehicles and their environmental benefits, it is likely that she will choose to buy an electric car.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Uncertainty Expression": "I'm quite uncertain about my previous answer. While Amy is interested in electric vehicles, the information provided does not definitively state that she will buy one. There could be other factors influencing her decision, such as cost, availability of charging infrastructure, or personal preferences. My confidence score is 0.4.",
                "Uncertainty-Aware Prompting Output - Revised": "Neutral. Although Amy is interested in electric vehicles and is considering their environmental benefits, this does not necessarily mean she will definitely buy an electric car. Factors such as cost, availability of suitable models, and charging infrastructure near her home or work could also influence her decision. More information would be needed to make a confident prediction. The hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise."
            },
            "Explanation": "In both examples, the baseline model generates overconfident outputs that assume the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, without considering the uncertainty and ambiguity in the input. The Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method, on the other hand, encourages the model to express its uncertainty and revise its initial output to be more calibrated and factually accurate. In the first example, the model revises its output from 'Entailment' to 'Neutral' after acknowledging the uncertainty and considering other factors that can influence job prospects. In the second example, the model changes its output from 'Entailment' to 'Neutral' after recognizing that Amy's interest in electric vehicles does not necessarily imply she will buy one, and that other factors could affect her decision. These examples demonstrate how Uncertainty-Aware Prompting can help reduce hallucination and generate more calibrated and nuanced outputs in the presence of uncertain inputs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Uncertainty-Aware Prompting method does not significantly improve calibration and uncertainty alignment compared to the baseline, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated uncertainty expressions to understand if the model is accurately capturing and conveying its uncertainty. If the uncertainty expressions are not well-calibrated or informative, we can explore alternative prompts or techniques to elicit more meaningful uncertainty estimates from the model.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt formulations on the effectiveness of Uncertainty-Aware Prompting. We can experiment with variations in the prompts used for each step of the method to identify the most effective way to encourage the model to express and incorporate uncertainty.\n3. Explore the use of external knowledge sources or retrieval-based methods to provide additional context and reduce uncertainty in the model's outputs. By augmenting the input with relevant information from reliable sources, we may be able to improve the model's confidence and accuracy.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify common patterns or characteristics of the examples where Uncertainty-Aware Prompting fails to improve calibration or reduce hallucination. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the proposed method and guide the development of alternative approaches.\n5. If the proposed method does not yield significant improvements, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the factors that contribute to overconfidence and hallucination in large language models. By conducting controlled experiments and ablation studies, we can investigate the impact of different model architectures, training objectives, and decoding strategies on the model's calibration and uncertainty awareness. This analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the challenges in reducing hallucination in large language models and inform future research directions."
