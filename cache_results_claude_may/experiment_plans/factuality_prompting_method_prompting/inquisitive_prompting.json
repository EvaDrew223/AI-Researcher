    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often generate overconfident and assertive responses, even when they are uncertain or lack sufficient information to answer a question accurately. This can lead to the generation of hallucinated or incorrect information.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for reducing hallucination, such as using calibrated confidence scores or adversarial filtering, focus on post-processing the generated outputs to identify and remove potentially hallucinated content.",
        "Motivation": "We propose that encouraging the model to ask clarifying questions when it is uncertain can help to reduce hallucination and improve the accuracy of generated responses. By prompting the model to adopt an inquisitive stance and seek additional information when needed, we can mitigate the tendency to generate overconfident and assertive responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Inquisitive Prompting (InqP), a prompting method that encourages the model to ask clarifying questions when it is uncertain about how to answer a given prompt. Given a question or prompt, we first ask the model to assess its confidence in being able to answer the question accurately. If the model's confidence is below a certain threshold, we prompt it to generate a clarifying question that would help it to answer the original question more accurately. We then provide the model with the answer to its clarifying question (either manually or by querying an external knowledge base), and prompt it to generate a final answer based on the original question and the additional information provided.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate InqP on a range of question-answering and open-ended generation tasks, such as answering questions from the Natural Questions dataset and generating summaries of news articles. We will compare the factuality and accuracy of responses generated by InqP to those generated by standard prompting methods, as well as to human-generated responses. We will also conduct a human evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the clarifying questions generated by the model in eliciting additional information and improving the accuracy of the final responses."

        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often generate overconfident and assertive responses, even when they are uncertain or lack sufficient information to answer a question accurately. This can lead to the generation of hallucinated or incorrect information.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate InqP on a range of question-answering and open-ended generation tasks, such as answering questions from the Natural Questions dataset, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA, and generating summaries of news articles from the CNN/DailyMail dataset. We will use standard metrics such as exact match, F1 score, and ROUGE for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, we will construct the following prompts:\n1. Baseline prompt: The original question or prompt, without any modifications.\n2. Confidence assessment prompt: 'Given the following question: [QUESTION], how confident are you that you can answer this question accurately? Please provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.'\n3. Clarifying question prompt (if confidence < 0.8): 'Given the following question: [QUESTION], what additional information would you need to answer this question more accurately? Please generate a clarifying question.'\n4. Final answer prompt: 'Given the following question: [QUESTION], and the additional information: [CLARIFICATION_ANSWER], please provide a final answer to the original question.'",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will evaluate InqP using GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 models from OpenAI. We will compare the performance of these models with and without InqP.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each dataset and model combination, we will generate responses using both the baseline and InqP prompts. For InqP, we will manually provide answers to the generated clarifying questions. We will then evaluate the accuracy and factuality of the generated responses using the metrics specified in Step 1.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will compare the performance of the models with and without InqP across all datasets and metrics. We will also conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated clarifying questions and final answers to assess the effectiveness of InqP in reducing hallucination and improving factuality. Additionally, we will conduct a human evaluation on a subset of the generated responses to assess their coherence, relevance, and overall quality."

            "Example 1": {
                "Baseline Prompt Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The capital of France is Paris.",
                "InqP Prompt Input (Confidence Assessment)": "Given the following question: What is the capital of France?, how confident are you that you can answer this question accurately? Please provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "InqP Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Assessment)": "0.95",

                "InqP Prompt Expected Output (Final Answer)": "The capital of France is Paris."

            "Example 2": {
                "Baseline Prompt Input": "What is the largest moon of Neptune?",
                "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "The largest moon of Neptune is Triton. It was discovered in 1846 by William Lassell, just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered.",
                "InqP Prompt Input (Confidence Assessment)": "Given the following question: What is the largest moon of Neptune?, how confident are you that you can answer this question accurately? Please provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.",
                "InqP Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Assessment)": "0.7",
                "InqP Prompt Input (Clarifying Question)": "Given the following question: What is the largest moon of Neptune?, what additional information would you need to answer this question more accurately? Please generate a clarifying question.",
                "InqP Prompt Expected Output (Clarifying Question)": "To confirm, are you asking about the largest moon of Neptune in terms of diameter, mass, or some other measure?",
                "InqP Prompt Input (Clarification Answer)": "I am asking about the largest moon of Neptune in terms of diameter.",
                "InqP Prompt Input (Final Answer)": "Given the following question: What is the largest moon of Neptune?, and the additional information: I am asking about the largest moon of Neptune in terms of diameter., please provide a final answer to the original question.",
                "InqP Prompt Expected Output (Final Answer)": "The largest moon of Neptune in terms of diameter is Triton, with a diameter of 2,706 km. It is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System and was discovered in 1846 by William Lassell, just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed InqP method does not significantly improve performance over the baselines, we can conduct additional analyses to understand why. Some potential avenues for investigation include:\n1. Analyzing the quality and relevance of the generated clarifying questions to determine if they are effective in eliciting useful additional information.\n2. Experimenting with different confidence thresholds for triggering the generation of clarifying questions to optimize the trade-off between asking for clarification and generating direct answers.\n3. Exploring alternative methods for answering the generated clarifying questions, such as using external knowledge bases or crowdsourcing, to assess the impact of the quality of the clarification answers on the final response.\n4. Conducting error analysis on the generated responses to identify common failure modes and potential areas for improvement in the prompting strategy.\nIf these analyses do not yield insights that can be used to improve InqP, we can consider alternative approaches, such as using retrieval-augmented generation or fine-tuning the models on datasets that explicitly include clarifying questions and answers. Alternatively, we can focus on characterizing the types of questions and domains where InqP is most effective, and propose hybrid strategies that combine InqP with other methods for reducing hallucination in large language models."
