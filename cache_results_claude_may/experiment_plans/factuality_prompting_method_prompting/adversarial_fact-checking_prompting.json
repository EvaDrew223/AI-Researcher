    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models can generate hallucinated content that is not supported by the input context or external knowledge, leading to factual inaccuracies in the generated output.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for reducing hallucination include using retrieval-augmented generation, incorporating external knowledge bases, or using reinforcement learning with factual consistency rewards.",
        "Motivation": "We hypothesize that large language models can be prompted to fact-check their own generated output, if framed as an adversarial game between a generator and a fact-checker. By explicitly prompting the model to generate both the initial output and a critique of its own output from an adversarial fact-checking perspective, we can encourage the model to generate more factually consistent output and catch its own mistakes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Fact-Checking Prompting, a novel prompting approach to reduce hallucination and improve factual accuracy. First, we prompt the model to generate an initial output given the input context. Second, we prompt the model to critique its own generated output from an adversarial fact-checking perspective, identifying any factual inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims. Third, we prompt the model to revise its initial output to address the critiques and generate a more factually consistent final output. We can repeat steps 2-3 for multiple rounds of adversarial fact-checking and revision.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our proposed method on factual consistency benchmarks such as the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) dataset and the Fact-Checking Assistant task. We will compare our method with baseline prompting approaches without adversarial fact-checking, as well as state-of-the-art methods for reducing hallucination. We will also analyze the quality and accuracy of the generated fact-checking critiques across multiple rounds of interaction."

        "Title": "Adversarial Fact-Checking Prompting for Reducing Hallucination in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate hallucinated content that is not supported by the input context or external knowledge, leading to factual inaccuracies in the generated output. This is a significant problem that hinders the reliability and trustworthiness of these models in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for reducing hallucination, such as retrieval-augmented generation, incorporating external knowledge bases, or using reinforcement learning with factual consistency rewards, have shown promising results but still face challenges in effectively mitigating the issue. We hypothesize that large language models can be prompted to fact-check their own generated output, if framed as an adversarial game between a generator and a fact-checker. By explicitly prompting the model to generate both the initial output and a critique of its own output from an adversarial fact-checking perspective, we can encourage the model to generate more factually consistent output and catch its own mistakes.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Fact-Checking Prompting, a novel prompting approach to reduce hallucination and improve factual accuracy. The method consists of three main steps:\n1. Initial Generation: Prompt the model to generate an initial output given the input context.\n2. Adversarial Fact-Checking: Prompt the model to critique its own generated output from an adversarial fact-checking perspective, identifying any factual inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims.\n3. Revision: Prompt the model to revise its initial output to address the critiques and generate a more factually consistent final output.\nWe can repeat steps 2-3 for multiple rounds of adversarial fact-checking and revision to further refine the output.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Evaluate the proposed method on factual consistency benchmarks such as the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) dataset and the Fact-Checking Assistant task. These datasets provide a diverse set of claims and corresponding evidence to assess the factual accuracy of generated outputs.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Compare the proposed method with the following baseline prompting approaches:\n1. Direct Prompting: Prompt the model to generate the output directly without any fact-checking or revision.\n2. Self-Consistency Prompting: Prompt the model to generate multiple outputs and select the most consistent one.\n3. Knowledge-Augmented Prompting: Incorporate relevant facts from external knowledge bases into the prompt to guide the generation process.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Engineering": "Design prompts for each step of the proposed method:\n1. Initial Generation Prompt: 'Given the following context, generate a response: [context]'\n2. Adversarial Fact-Checking Prompt: 'Critically analyze the following generated output for any factual inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims: [generated_output]'\n3. Revision Prompt: 'Revise the following generated output to address the identified factual issues: [generated_output] [fact_checking_critique]'",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Experiment with state-of-the-art large language models such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method across different model sizes and capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Assess the factual consistency of the generated outputs using the following metrics:\n1. Accuracy: Percentage of generated outputs that are factually consistent with the input context and external knowledge.\n2. F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, considering both the correctness and completeness of the generated facts.\n3. Human Evaluation: Conduct a human evaluation to assess the factual consistency, coherence, and overall quality of the generated outputs.",
            "Step 6: Iterative Refinement": "Investigate the impact of multiple rounds of adversarial fact-checking and revision on the factual consistency of the generated outputs. Vary the number of iterations (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and analyze the trade-off between factual accuracy and computational cost.",
            "Step 7: Error Analysis": "Perform a qualitative analysis of the generated outputs to identify common types of factual errors and limitations of the proposed method. Use these insights to guide future improvements and research directions.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Study": "Conduct an ablation study to understand the contribution of each component of the proposed method. Evaluate the performance of the model with and without adversarial fact-checking and revision steps to assess their individual impact on factual consistency."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Input": "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.",
                "Baseline Output (Direct Prompting)": "The Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark located in Paris, France. It was designed by the French architect Gustave Eiffel and completed in 1889. The tower stands at a height of 324 meters and is made of wrought-iron. It was originally built as the entrance arch for the 1889 World's Fair and has since become a global cultural icon of France.",
                "Proposed Method Output": "Initial Generation: The Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark in Paris, France. It was designed and built by the company of engineer Gustave Eiffel, after whom the tower is named. The tower is constructed using wrought-iron lattice and stands on the Champ de Mars. It was completed in 1889 and has a height of 324 meters, making it the tallest structure in Paris.\n\nAdversarial Fact-Checking: The generated output is mostly factually consistent with the given context. However, there are a few unsupported claims:\n1. The output mentions that the tower was completed in 1889, but this information is not provided in the input context.\n2. The output states that the Eiffel Tower is the tallest structure in Paris, but this claim is not supported by the given context.\n\nRevised Output: The Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is a wrought-iron lattice tower designed and built by the company of engineer Gustave Eiffel, after whom the tower is named. The tower stands at a height of 324 meters.",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method generates an initial output that contains some unsupported claims not present in the input context. The adversarial fact-checking step identifies these unsupported claims, and the revision step generates a more factually consistent output by removing the unsupported information."

            "Example 2": {
                "Input": "The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications and walls built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China to protect against nomadic invasions from the Eurasian Steppe.",
                "Baseline Output (Knowledge-Augmented Prompting)": "The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications built along the northern borders of Imperial China. It was constructed to protect the Chinese Empire and its territories against nomadic invasions from the Eurasian Steppe. The wall stretches over 21,000 kilometers from the Shanhaiguan district in the east to the Lop Lake in the west. It is made of stone, brick, tamped earth, and other materials. The Great Wall is not a single continuous wall, but rather a series of multiple walls and fortifications built by various dynasties over centuries. Construction of the first sections of the wall began during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) and continued through the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE). Today, the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction, attracting millions of visitors each year.",
                "Proposed Method Output": "Initial Generation: The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications and walls constructed along the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China. Its primary purpose was to protect against nomadic invasions originating from the Eurasian Steppe. The wall spans over 21,000 kilometers from the eastern Shanhaiguan district to the western Lop Lake. It is composed of various materials, including stone, brick, and tamped earth. The Great Wall is not a single continuous structure but rather a collection of multiple walls and fortifications built by different dynasties over several centuries. The initial construction began during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) and continued through the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE). In modern times, the Great Wall has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of tourists annually.\n\nAdversarial Fact-Checking: The generated output provides additional information that is not directly supported by the given input context:\n1. The output mentions specific details about the length and endpoints of the Great Wall (21,000 kilometers from Shanhaiguan to Lop Lake), but these facts are not present in the input.\n2. The output states that the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction, attracting millions of visitors each year. While these claims may be true, they are not supported by the provided context.\n\nRevised Output: The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications and walls constructed along the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China. Its main purpose was to protect against nomadic invasions from the Eurasian Steppe. The Great Wall is not a single continuous structure but rather a collection of multiple walls and fortifications built by different dynasties over several centuries. The initial construction began during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) and continued through the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE).",
                "Explanation": "The knowledge-augmented prompting baseline generates an output that contains several additional facts not present in the input context, such as the specific length and endpoints of the Great Wall and its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The proposed method identifies these unsupported claims during the adversarial fact-checking step and generates a revised output that omits the unsupported information, resulting in a more factually consistent response."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Adversarial Fact-Checking Prompting method does not significantly improve the factual consistency of the generated outputs compared to the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality and accuracy of the generated fact-checking critiques to identify potential weaknesses in the adversarial fact-checking step. Investigate whether the model struggles to identify certain types of factual errors or generates critiques that are not sufficiently informative for the revision step.\n2. Experiment with different prompt formulations and instructions to guide the model in generating more effective fact-checking critiques and revisions. Explore alternative prompting strategies, such as providing more explicit instructions or using few-shot examples to demonstrate the desired behavior.\n3. Investigate the impact of domain-specific knowledge on the factual consistency of the generated outputs. Incorporate domain-specific facts or knowledge bases into the prompts to provide additional context and constraints for the generation process.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify common patterns and sources of factual inconsistencies in the generated outputs. Use these insights to develop targeted strategies for addressing specific types of errors, such as incorporating additional fact-checking steps or using domain-specific fact-checking models.\n5. If the proposed method does not yield significant improvements, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations and challenges of fact-checking in large language models. Investigate the factors that contribute to the generation of hallucinated content and explore alternative approaches for mitigating this issue, such as combining multiple fact-checking techniques or leveraging human feedback to guide the model towards more factually consistent outputs."
