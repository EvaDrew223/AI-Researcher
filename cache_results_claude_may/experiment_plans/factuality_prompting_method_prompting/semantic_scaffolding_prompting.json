        "Problem": "Large language models often generate outputs that are grammatically correct but lack semantic coherence or logical structure. This can lead to the generation of texts that are difficult to follow or that fail to effectively communicate the intended message.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving the semantic coherence of generated text, such as using discourse-aware models or post-processing the outputs to improve coherence, often require additional training or computational overhead.",
        "Motivation": "We propose that providing the model with a semantic scaffold - a high-level outline of the key ideas and their logical relationships - can help to guide the generation process and ensure that the output has a clear and coherent structure. By decomposing the writing task into smaller, more manageable steps and providing explicit guidance on the desired structure of the output, we can improve the semantic coherence and effectiveness of the generated text.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Semantic Scaffolding Prompting (SSP), a prompting method that provides the model with a high-level semantic scaffold to guide the generation process. Given a writing prompt, we first prompt the model to generate a high-level outline of the key ideas and their logical relationships, using prompts such as \"What are the main points you want to make in this essay?\" and \"How do these points relate to each other?\". We then prompt the model to generate the full text, using the semantic scaffold as a guide. For each section of the scaffold, we provide focused prompts that encourage the model to elaborate on the key ideas and their relationships, while ensuring that the overall structure remains coherent.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SSP on a range of writing tasks, such as essay writing, article generation, and report writing. We will compare the semantic coherence and logical structure of outputs generated by SSP to those generated by standard prompting methods, as well as to human-written texts. We will use established metrics for evaluating text coherence, such as the entity grid model and the lexical chain model, as well as human evaluations of the clarity and effectiveness of the generated texts. We will also explore the use of different types of semantic scaffolds, such as outlines, concept maps, and argumentative schemas, to determine which are most effective for different types of writing tasks."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate SSP on a range of writing tasks, such as essay writing (e.g., the Automated Student Assessment Prize dataset), article generation (e.g., the CNN/Daily Mail dataset), and report writing (e.g., the arXiv dataset). We will use established metrics for evaluating text coherence, such as the entity grid model and the lexical chain model, as well as human evaluations of the clarity and effectiveness of the generated texts.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, we will construct a set of baseline prompts that directly ask the model to generate the full text, without any scaffolding. For SSP, we will construct prompts for generating the semantic scaffold, such as:\n- \"What are the main points you want to make in this essay?\"\n- \"How do these points relate to each other?\"\n- \"What examples or evidence can you provide to support each point?\"\nWe will then construct prompts for generating each section of the text, using the scaffold as a guide, such as:\n- \"Elaborate on the first point in your outline. What are the key ideas and how do they relate to the overall argument?\"\n- \"Provide a smooth transition from the previous section to the next point in your outline.\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will evaluate SSP using GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 via the OpenAI API. We will compare the performance of these models with and without SSP.",
            "Step 4: Generate Outputs": "For each dataset and model, we will generate outputs using both the baseline prompts and SSP. For SSP, we will first generate the semantic scaffold, and then use it to guide the generation of the full text.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Outputs": "We will evaluate the generated outputs using both automated metrics (e.g., entity grid model, lexical chain model) and human evaluations. For human evaluations, we will recruit participants to rate the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of the generated texts on a 5-point Likert scale. We will also ask participants to provide qualitative feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of each output.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "We will compare the performance of the models with and without SSP, using both automated metrics and human evaluations. We will also analyze the qualitative feedback from human evaluators to identify common strengths and weaknesses of the generated texts. Finally, we will explore the use of different types of semantic scaffolds (e.g., outlines, concept maps, argumentative schemas) to determine which are most effective for different types of writing tasks."

            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Write an essay discussing the benefits and drawbacks of remote work.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Remote work has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While remote work offers many benefits, such as increased flexibility and reduced commute times, it also has some significant drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of remote work.\n\nOne of the main benefits of remote work is increased flexibility. When working remotely, employees have greater control over their schedules and can often choose when and where they work. This can be particularly beneficial for those with caregiving responsibilities or other personal obligations that make a traditional 9-to-5 schedule challenging. Remote work can also allow employees to create a work environment that suits their individual needs and preferences, which can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction.\n\nAnother advantage of remote work is reduced commute times. Without the need to travel to and from an office each day, remote workers can save significant amounts of time and money on transportation costs. This can also have environmental benefits, as fewer people commuting means reduced carbon emissions and traffic congestion.\n\nHowever, remote work also has some significant drawbacks. One of the main challenges is the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues. While video conferencing and other communication tools can help to mitigate this issue, they cannot fully replace the benefits of in-person collaboration and relationship-building. Remote workers may also struggle with feelings of isolation and disconnection from their team, which can negatively impact mental health and job satisfaction.\n\nAnother potential drawback of remote work is the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life. When working from home, it can be difficult to separate work time from leisure time, leading to longer working hours and increased stress levels. Remote workers may also struggle with distractions from family members or household tasks, which can make it challenging to focus on work.\n\nIn conclusion, while remote work offers many benefits, such as increased flexibility and reduced commute times, it also has some significant drawbacks, such as lack of face-to-face interaction and blurred boundaries between work and personal life. Ultimately, the decision to work remotely will depend on individual circumstances and preferences. Employers should strive to create remote work policies that maximize the benefits while mitigating the challenges, in order to support the well-being and productivity of their remote workforce.",
            "SSP Prompt Input (Step 1: Generate Scaffold)": "What are the main points you want to make in this essay about the benefits and drawbacks of remote work? How do these points relate to each other?",
            "SSP Expected Output (Step 1: Generate Scaffold)": "Main points:\n1. Benefits of remote work\n   a. Increased flexibility\n   b. Reduced commute times\n2. Drawbacks of remote work\n   a. Lack of face-to-face interaction\n   b. Blurred boundaries between work and personal life\n3. Conclusion\n   a. Remote work has both benefits and drawbacks\n   b. Decision to work remotely depends on individual circumstances\n   c. Employers should create policies to maximize benefits and mitigate challenges\n\nThe essay will discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of remote work, presenting a balanced view of the topic. The benefits section will focus on increased flexibility and reduced commute times, while the drawbacks section will discuss the lack of face-to-face interaction and blurred boundaries between work and personal life. The conclusion will summarize the main points and suggest that the decision to work remotely depends on individual circumstances, and that employers should create policies to support remote workers.",
            "SSP Prompt Input (Step 2: Generate Text)": "Using the semantic scaffold as a guide, write an essay discussing the benefits and drawbacks of remote work. For each section of the scaffold, elaborate on the key ideas and their relationships, while ensuring that the overall structure remains coherent.",
            "SSP Expected Output (Step 2: Generate Text)": "Remote work has become increasingly common in recent years, offering both benefits and drawbacks for employees and employers alike. In this essay, I will explore the main advantages and disadvantages of remote work, and discuss how individuals and organizations can navigate this new way of working.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of remote work is the increased flexibility it offers. When employees are not tied to a physical office, they have greater control over when and where they work. This can be particularly advantageous for those with caregiving responsibilities, health issues, or other personal circumstances that make a traditional 9-to-5 schedule challenging. Remote work allows employees to create a work environment that suits their individual needs and preferences, which can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction.\n\nAnother significant benefit of remote work is the reduction in commute times. When employees can work from home or a location closer to home, they can save hours each day that would otherwise be spent traveling to and from the office. This not only frees up more time for work and personal activities, but also has environmental benefits, as fewer people commuting means reduced carbon emissions and traffic congestion.\n\nHowever, remote work also has some notable drawbacks. One of the most significant challenges is the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues. While video conferencing and other communication tools can help to mitigate this issue, they cannot fully replace the benefits of in-person collaboration and relationship-building. Remote workers may feel isolated and disconnected from their team, which can negatively impact mental health and job satisfaction. This is particularly true for those who thrive on social interaction and rely on the energy and support of their colleagues.\n\nAnother potential drawback of remote work is the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life. When the home becomes the workplace, it can be difficult to separate work time from leisure time, leading to longer working hours and increased stress levels. Remote workers may also struggle with distractions from family members, household tasks, or other non-work activities, which can make it challenging to focus and be productive.\n\nIn conclusion, remote work has both significant benefits and drawbacks that individuals and organizations must carefully consider. While increased flexibility and reduced commute times are clear advantages, the lack of face-to-face interaction and blurred boundaries between work and personal life can pose challenges. Ultimately, the decision to work remotely will depend on individual circumstances and preferences, as well as the nature of the work itself. Employers should strive to create remote work policies that maximize the benefits while mitigating the challenges, in order to support the well-being and productivity of their remote workforce. This may include providing tools and resources for effective communication and collaboration, setting clear expectations around work hours and availability, and fostering a culture of trust and support. By taking a proactive and thoughtful approach to remote work, individuals and organizations can reap the benefits while navigating the challenges of this new way of working.",
            "Explanation": "The SSP output is more coherent and well-structured than the baseline output. By first generating a semantic scaffold that outlines the main points and their relationships, the model is able to create a clear and logical structure for the essay. The final output elaborates on each point in the scaffold, while maintaining a smooth flow between ideas. In contrast, the baseline output, while covering similar points, lacks a clear structure and transitions between ideas, making it harder to follow the overall argument."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SSP method does not yield significant improvements over the baselines, we can explore several alternative approaches:\n\n1. Analyze the generated semantic scaffolds to determine if they are sufficiently detailed and relevant to the writing task. If the scaffolds are too high-level or generic, we can experiment with more specific prompts or templates to guide the scaffold generation process.\n\n2. Investigate alternative methods for incorporating the semantic scaffold into the text generation process. For example, instead of using the scaffold to guide the generation of each section sequentially, we could experiment with using the scaffold to conditionally generate different parts of the text in parallel, and then combine them into a coherent whole.\n\n3. Explore the use of additional prompts or constraints to encourage the model to maintain coherence and logical structure throughout the generation process. For example, we could provide prompts that encourage the model to use explicit discourse markers (e.g., \"first\", \"next\", \"in conclusion\") to signal the relationships between ideas.\n\n4. Conduct a more in-depth error analysis of the generated texts to identify specific types of coherence or structural issues that the model struggles with. This could inform the development of targeted prompts or post-processing techniques to address these issues.\n\n5. If the SSP method does not yield any meaningful improvements, we could pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of current language models in generating coherent and well-structured text. This could involve conducting a systematic comparison of different models and prompting strategies, and identifying the key factors that contribute to coherence and logical structure in human-written texts. The insights from this analysis could inform the development of new architectures, training methods, or evaluation metrics for language models that prioritize coherence and structure."
