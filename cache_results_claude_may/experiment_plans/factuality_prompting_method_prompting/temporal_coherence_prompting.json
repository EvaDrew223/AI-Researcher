        "Problem": "LLMs often generate responses that lack temporal coherence, leading to inconsistencies and hallucinations when dealing with events or stories that unfold over time.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to improve temporal coherence in LLMs include fine-tuning on temporally annotated datasets or using prompts that encourage maintaining a consistent timeline. However, these methods often fail to capture the nuances of temporal relationships between events.",
        "Motivation": "Temporal coherence is essential for understanding and generating coherent narratives, as well as reasoning about cause-and-effect relationships. By explicitly prompting LLMs to consider the temporal aspects of a given scenario, we can improve their ability to generate more factual and consistent responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Coherence Prompting (TCP), a multi-step prompting approach that guides LLMs to maintain temporal consistency in their responses. The steps include: 1) Identifying key events in the given scenario; 2) Constructing a temporal graph that captures the relationships between these events; 3) Generating a response that adheres to the temporal constraints imposed by the graph; 4) Verifying the temporal coherence of the generated response by comparing it with the temporal graph; 5) Iteratively refining the response to resolve any temporal inconsistencies.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TCP on datasets that require temporal reasoning, such as TimeTravel and MCTaco. Compare performance with baselines such as zero-shot prompting and fine-tuning on temporally annotated datasets. Assess the temporal coherence of generated responses using metrics like TimeML and human evaluation."

        "Title": "Temporal Coherence Prompting: Improving Factual Consistency in Event-Centric Text Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that lack temporal coherence, leading to inconsistencies and hallucinations when dealing with events or stories that unfold over time.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improve temporal coherence in LLMs, such as fine-tuning on temporally annotated datasets or using prompts that encourage maintaining a consistent timeline, often fail to capture the nuances of temporal relationships between events.

        "Proposed Method": "We propose Temporal Coherence Prompting (TCP), a multi-step prompting approach that guides LLMs to maintain temporal consistency in their responses. The steps include:\n1. Identifying key events in the given scenario\n2. Constructing a temporal graph that captures the relationships between these events\n3. Generating a response that adheres to the temporal constraints imposed by the graph\n4. Verifying the temporal coherence of the generated response by comparing it with the temporal graph\n5. Iteratively refining the response to resolve any temporal inconsistencies",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate TCP on datasets that require temporal reasoning, such as TimeTravel, MCTaco, TORQUE, and NarrativeQA. These datasets cover a range of tasks, including question answering, story generation, and event ordering.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "Design a set of prompts for each step of the TCP approach:\n1. Event Identification Prompt: Guide the model to identify and extract key events from the given scenario (e.g., \"List the main events in the following text:\").\n2. Temporal Graph Construction Prompt: Instruct the model to construct a temporal graph representing the relationships between the identified events (e.g., \"Create a graph showing the temporal order and connections between the events:\").\n3. Response Generation Prompt: Prompt the model to generate a response that adheres to the temporal constraints of the graph (e.g., \"Generate a response to the following question, ensuring that the events follow the temporal order in the graph:\").\n4. Temporal Coherence Verification Prompt: Ask the model to compare the generated response with the temporal graph and identify any inconsistencies (e.g., \"Check if the generated response follows the temporal order in the graph and list any inconsistencies:\").\n5. Response Refinement Prompt: Guide the model to refine the response based on the identified inconsistencies (e.g., \"Revise the response to resolve the temporal inconsistencies identified in the previous step:\").",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate TCP using state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and open-source models like Flan-T5 and LLaMA. Compare the performance of these models with and without TCP.",
            "Step 4: Establish Baselines": "Compare the performance of TCP with the following baselines:\n1. Zero-shot prompting: Directly prompt the model with the task without any additional guidance.\n2. Fine-tuning on temporally annotated datasets: Fine-tune the models on datasets with temporal annotations and evaluate their performance on the target datasets.\n3. Temporal prompting: Use prompts that encourage the model to maintain a consistent timeline (e.g., \"Ensure that the events in your response follow a chronological order.\").",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Results": "Assess the performance of TCP and the baselines using the following metrics:\n1. Temporal coherence: Measure the percentage of generated responses that maintain a consistent temporal order of events.\n2. Factual consistency: Evaluate the factual accuracy of the generated responses using dataset-specific metrics (e.g., F1 score, BLEU, ROUGE).\n3. Human evaluation: Conduct a human evaluation to assess the coherence, fluency, and overall quality of the generated responses.",
            "Step 6: Analyze and Iterate": "Analyze the results to identify strengths and weaknesses of the TCP approach. Iterate on the prompts and the overall method based on the findings to further improve performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Input": "John woke up at 7 AM. He had breakfast and then went for a run. After returning home, he took a shower and got dressed for work. He drove to the office and arrived at 9 AM. Question: What did John do before going for a run?",
                "Baseline Output": "Based on the given information, John went for a run before having breakfast.",
                "TCP Output": "Event Identification:\n1. John woke up at 7 AM\n2. He had breakfast\n3. He went for a run\n4. He returned home\n5. He took a shower\n6. He got dressed for work\n7. He drove to the office\n8. He arrived at the office at 9 AM\n\nTemporal Graph:\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8\n\nResponse: According to the temporal order of events, John had breakfast before going for a run.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output fails to capture the correct temporal order of events, leading to an inconsistent response. TCP, on the other hand, identifies the key events, constructs a temporal graph, and generates a response that adheres to the temporal constraints, resulting in a more accurate and coherent answer."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input": "Sarah and Tom were classmates in high school. They started dating during their senior year. After graduation, Sarah moved to New York for college, while Tom stayed in their hometown to work. They tried a long-distance relationship but eventually broke up. Five years later, they met at a reunion and rekindled their relationship. They got married a year later and had two children. Question: Did Sarah and Tom date before or after they graduated from high school?",
                "Baseline Output": "Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether Sarah and Tom dated before or after they graduated from high school.",
                "TCP Output": "Event Identification:\n1. Sarah and Tom were classmates in high school\n2. They started dating during their senior year\n3. They graduated from high school\n4. Sarah moved to New York for college\n5. Tom stayed in their hometown to work\n6. They tried a long-distance relationship\n7. They broke up\n8. Five years later, they met at a reunion\n9. They rekindled their relationship\n10. They got married a year later\n11. They had two children\n\nTemporal Graph:\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11\n\nResponse: According to the temporal order of events, Sarah and Tom started dating during their senior year in high school, which was before they graduated.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output fails to provide a definitive answer to the question, as it does not effectively reason about the temporal relationship between the events. TCP, however, identifies the relevant events, constructs a temporal graph, and generates a response that directly addresses the question by correctly inferring the temporal order of the events."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TCP approach does not yield significant improvements over the baselines, consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the generated temporal graphs and responses to identify potential weaknesses in the prompts or the overall method. Refine the prompts and iterate on the approach based on these findings.\n2. Investigate the impact of different temporal representation techniques, such as temporal logic or interval algebra, on the performance of the TCP approach.\n3. Explore the integration of external knowledge sources, such as temporal knowledge graphs or temporal common sense databases, to enhance the model's temporal reasoning capabilities.\n4. Conduct a thorough error analysis to understand the types of temporal inconsistencies that the model struggles with and develop targeted strategies to address these challenges.\n5. Consider combining TCP with other techniques, such as reinforcement learning or adversarial training, to further improve the model's temporal coherence and factual consistency.\n\nIf the TCP approach fails to yield meaningful results after these iterations, focus on analyzing the factors that contribute to the model's temporal inconsistencies and present these findings as valuable insights for future research in this area."
