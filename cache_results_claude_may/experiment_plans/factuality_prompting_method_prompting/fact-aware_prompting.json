    "idea_name": "Fact-Aware Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models tend to generate factually incorrect information when answering questions or generating text. Existing methods often rely on fact-checking against knowledge bases or human feedback, which can be expensive and time-consuming.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for reducing hallucination include using retrieved evidence to guide generation, training models to be more calibrated in their outputs, or using reinforcement learning with factual consistency rewards.",
        "Motivation": "Instead of relying on post-hoc fact-checking or additional training, we propose to make the model more aware of factual information during the generation process itself. By conditioning the model on relevant facts and training it to attend to factual evidence, we can guide it to generate more factually consistent outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Fact-Aware Prompting (FAP), a method that incorporates factual information into the prompting process to guide the model's generation. Given an input query, FAP first retrieves relevant facts from a trusted knowledge source (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikidata). It then constructs a prompt that includes both the original query and the retrieved facts, using special tokens to distinguish the facts from the query. During generation, the model is trained to attend to the factual evidence provided in the prompt, using techniques such as attention masking or fact-aware decoding. The model is also trained to generate outputs that are consistent with the provided facts, using techniques such as factual consistency loss or fact-aware beam search.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate FAP on a range of factual generation tasks, such as open-domain question answering, fact-grounded dialog, and fact-guided summarization. We will compare FAP to baseline methods such as direct prompting and retrieved-augmented generation, as well as state-of-the-art methods that use post-hoc fact-checking or reinforcement learning. We will measure factuality using both automatic metrics (e.g., factual F1, consistency score) and human evaluation of the generated outputs' correctness and consistency with the provided facts."

        "Title": "Fact-Aware Prompting: Incorporating Factual Evidence to Guide Language Model Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models tend to generate factually incorrect information when answering questions or generating text. Existing methods often rely on fact-checking against knowledge bases or human feedback, which can be expensive and time-consuming.",
        "Motivation": "Instead of relying on post-hoc fact-checking or additional training, we propose to make the model more aware of factual information during the generation process itself. By conditioning the model on relevant facts and training it to attend to factual evidence, we can guide it to generate more factually consistent outputs. This approach is inspired by two key ideas: (1) retrieving relevant facts can provide useful context for the model to generate more accurate outputs, and (2) explicitly training the model to attend to and incorporate the retrieved facts can help mitigate the issue of hallucination.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Fact-Aware Prompting (FAP), a method that incorporates factual information into the prompting process to guide the model's generation. Given an input query, FAP first retrieves relevant facts from a trusted knowledge source (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikidata). It then constructs a prompt that includes both the original query and the retrieved facts, using special tokens to distinguish the facts from the query. During generation, the model is trained to attend to the factual evidence provided in the prompt, using techniques such as attention masking or fact-aware decoding. The model is also trained to generate outputs that are consistent with the provided facts, using techniques such as factual consistency loss or fact-aware beam search.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Data Preparation": "We will use a diverse set of factual generation tasks, such as open-domain question answering (e.g., Natural Questions, TriviaQA), fact-grounded dialog (e.g., Wizard of Wikipedia), and fact-guided summarization (e.g., XSum). For each task, we will use the standard train/dev/test splits. We will also use a trusted knowledge source (e.g., Wikipedia) to retrieve relevant facts for each input query.",
            "Step 2: Fact Retrieval": "For each input query, we will retrieve the top-k most relevant facts from the knowledge source using a retrieval model (e.g., BM25, DPR). We will experiment with different values of k (e.g., 1, 3, 5) to find the optimal number of facts to retrieve. We will also experiment with different retrieval models to find the most effective one for each task.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Construction": "We will construct prompts that include both the original query and the retrieved facts. We will use special tokens (e.g., <fact>) to distinguish the facts from the query. For example, a prompt for a question answering task may look like: 'Question: What is the capital of France? <fact> Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. </fact> Answer:'. We will experiment with different prompt formats to find the most effective one for each task.",
            "Step 4: Model Training": "We will train the language model to generate outputs that are consistent with the provided facts. We will use techniques such as attention masking (i.e., forcing the model to attend only to the retrieved facts) and fact-aware decoding (i.e., penalizing the model for generating tokens that are inconsistent with the facts). We will also experiment with different loss functions, such as factual consistency loss (i.e., penalizing the model for generating outputs that are inconsistent with the facts) and fact-aware beam search (i.e., favoring hypotheses that are consistent with the facts during beam search). We will use pre-trained language models (e.g., T5, BART) as the base models and fine-tune them on each task using the constructed prompts.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the trained models on the test set of each task using both automatic metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, F1) and human evaluation. For human evaluation, we will ask annotators to rate the generated outputs in terms of factual consistency (i.e., whether the output is consistent with the provided facts), relevance (i.e., whether the output answers the input query), and fluency (i.e., whether the output is grammatically correct and easy to understand). We will compare FAP with baseline methods such as direct prompting (i.e., prompting the model with the input query only) and retrieval-augmented generation (i.e., concatenating the retrieved facts with the input query). We will also conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of FAP (e.g., fact retrieval, prompt construction, model training)."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Input Query": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Retrieved Facts": "Paris is the capital and most populous city of France.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Baseline Output": "The capital of France is Paris, but some people may mistakenly think it is Lyon or Marseille.",
                "FAP Prompt": "Question: What is the capital of France? <fact> Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. </fact> Answer:",
                "FAP Output": "Paris is the capital of France.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline model generates a factually incorrect output by mentioning Lyon and Marseille as potential capitals of France. In contrast, FAP retrieves the relevant fact that Paris is the capital of France and incorporates it into the prompt. This guides the model to generate a factually consistent output that correctly answers the question."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input Query": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
                "Retrieved Facts": "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. It has a mass of 1.898 \u00d7 10^27 kg and a radius of 69,911 km.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
                "Baseline Output": "The largest planet in our solar system is Saturn, with a radius of about 58,232 km.",
                "FAP Prompt": "Question: What is the largest planet in our solar system? <fact> Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. It has a mass of 1.898 \u00d7 10^27 kg and a radius of 69,911 km. </fact> Answer:",
                "FAP Output": "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a radius of 69,911 km.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline model generates a factually incorrect output by stating that Saturn is the largest planet in our solar system. In contrast, FAP retrieves the relevant fact that Jupiter is the largest planet and provides its mass and radius. This guides the model to generate a factually consistent output that correctly answers the question and provides additional relevant information."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed FAP method does not outperform the baseline methods, we can conduct additional analysis to understand why. Some potential directions include: (1) Analyzing the retrieved facts to see if they are relevant and informative for answering the input queries. If the retrieved facts are not relevant or informative, we can experiment with different retrieval models or knowledge sources. (2) Analyzing the constructed prompts to see if they effectively incorporate the retrieved facts. If the prompts are not effective, we can experiment with different prompt formats or ways of distinguishing the facts from the queries. (3) Analyzing the generated outputs to see if they are consistent with the retrieved facts. If the outputs are not consistent, we can experiment with different model training techniques or loss functions to better enforce factual consistency. If FAP still does not outperform the baselines after these analyses and modifications, we can turn the project into an analysis paper that provides insights into the challenges and limitations of incorporating factual evidence into language model prompting."
