        "Problem": "Large language models can generate inconsistent or contradictory statements across different parts of the generated output, leading to reduced coherence and factual accuracy.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving consistency include using self-consistency decoding or bootstrapping a coherence classifier to guide generation.",
        "Motivation": "We observe that large language models have the ability to reason about counterfactual scenarios and identify inconsistencies in generated text. By explicitly prompting the model to consider counterfactual scenarios and verify the consistency of its generated output, we can encourage the model to generate more coherent and factually consistent text.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Consistency Prompting, a novel prompting approach to improve the consistency and factual accuracy of generated text. First, we prompt the model to generate an initial output. Second, we prompt the model to generate counterfactual scenarios that are similar to but slightly modified from the initial output. Third, we prompt the model to verify the consistency between the initial output and the counterfactual scenarios, and to identify any contradictions or inconsistencies. Fourth, we prompt the model to revise the initial output to resolve the identified inconsistencies and generate a more coherent and factually consistent final output.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our proposed method on consistency benchmarks such as the Contradiction Detection task and the Abductive Natural Language Inference task. We will compare our method with baseline prompting approaches without counterfactual consistency verification, as well as state-of-the-art methods for improving consistency in generated text."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Consistency Prompting Improves Factual Consistency of Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate inconsistent or contradictory statements across different parts of the generated output, leading to reduced coherence and factual accuracy.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for improving consistency, such as self-consistency decoding or bootstrapping a coherence classifier to guide generation, rely on modifying the decoding process or training additional models. We observe that large language models have the ability to reason about counterfactual scenarios and identify inconsistencies in generated text. By explicitly prompting the model to consider counterfactual scenarios and verify the consistency of its generated output, we can encourage the model to generate more coherent and factually consistent text without the need for additional training or decoding modifications.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Consistency Prompting, a novel prompting approach to improve the consistency and factual accuracy of generated text. The method consists of four main steps:\n1. Generate Initial Output: Prompt the model to generate an initial output given an input.\n2. Generate Counterfactuals: Prompt the model to generate counterfactual scenarios that are similar to but slightly modified from the initial output.\n3. Verify Consistency: Prompt the model to verify the consistency between the initial output and the counterfactual scenarios, and to identify any contradictions or inconsistencies. \n4. Revise Output: Prompt the model to revise the initial output to resolve the identified inconsistencies and generate a more coherent and factually consistent final output.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate the proposed method on consistency benchmarks such as the Contradiction Detection dataset (Marneffe et al., 2022) which contains labeled sentence pairs that are either consistent or contradictory, and the Abductive Natural Language Inference dataset (Bhagavatula et al., 2020) which requires models to select the more plausible hypothesis given an observation. These datasets allow measuring the ability to detect and resolve inconsistencies.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Baseline Prompts: \n  a. Direct Prompting: Prompt the model with the input directly to generate the output. \n  b. Self-Consistency Prompting: Prompt the model to generate multiple outputs and select the most consistent one.\n2. Counterfactual Consistency Prompts:\n  a. Initial Output Prompt: Generate an initial output for the given input.\n  b. Counterfactual Generation Prompt: Generate 2-3 counterfactual scenarios by modifying some aspects of the initial output while preserving most of it. \n  c. Consistency Verification Prompt: Given the initial output and counterfactuals, identify if there are any contradictions or inconsistencies between them.\n  d. Revision Prompt: Revise the initial output to resolve inconsistencies identified.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the proposed method on GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and ChatGPT. This allows comparing performance across models of different sizes and capabilities.",
            "Step 4: Run Experiments": "For each dataset and model combination:\n1. Run the baseline prompts and generate outputs.\n2. Run the Counterfactual Consistency Prompts:\n  a. Generate initial outputs\n  b. Generate counterfactual scenarios\n  c. Verify consistency and identify contradictions\n  d. Revise outputs to resolve inconsistencies\n3. Evaluate the outputs using the dataset metrics.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "1. Compare the performance of Counterfactual Consistency Prompting with the baseline methods. Measure the improvement in consistency and factual accuracy.\n2. Analyze the types of inconsistencies that the method is able to identify and resolve.\n3. Examine the quality of the generated counterfactuals and their impact on the final revised outputs."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Observation: John entered the room and saw a broken vase on the floor. \nHypothesis 1: John's dog broke the vase. \nHypothesis 2: John broke the vase.\nQuestion: Which hypothesis is more plausible based on the observation?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Hypothesis 1 is more plausible. The observation states that John saw a broken vase upon entering the room, suggesting that it was broken before he entered. Hypothesis 2 implies that John himself broke the vase, which is less likely given that he seems to be just discovering the broken vase.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Counterfactual Consistency Prompting)": "Observation: John entered the room and saw a broken vase on the floor. \nHypothesis 1: John's dog broke the vase. \nHypothesis 2: John broke the vase.\nQuestion: Which hypothesis is more plausible based on the observation?\n\nStep 1: Generate an initial output.\nStep 2: Generate 2-3 counterfactual scenarios by slightly modifying the observation or hypotheses.\nStep 3: Verify if the initial output is consistent with the counterfactual scenarios. Identify any contradictions.\nStep 4: Revise the initial output to resolve any inconsistencies.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Counterfactual Consistency Prompting)": "Step 1 Initial Output: Hypothesis 1 is more plausible. John saw the broken vase upon entering the room, so it was likely broken before he arrived. Hypothesis 2 suggests John broke it himself, which contradicts him just discovering it broken.\n\nStep 2 Counterfactual Scenarios:\n1. John entered the room and saw his dog standing next to a broken vase on the floor.\n2. John heard a crash from the room and then entered to find a broken vase on the floor.\n\nStep 3 Consistency Verification: The initial output is consistent with counterfactual 1, as the dog's presence near the broken vase strengthens the hypothesis that the dog broke it. However, counterfactual 2 introduces new information that John heard the vase break before entering the room. This contradicts the initial output's reasoning that the vase was broken before John arrived.\n\nStep 4 Revised Output: Hypothesis 1 is more plausible given the original observation. The observation only states that John discovered the broken vase upon entering the room, suggesting it broke before he entered. Hypothesis 2 is less likely as it requires assuming John broke the vase after entering the room, which is not directly supported by the given observation. More information would be needed to determine if John broke the vase himself after entering.",
            "Explanation": "The initial output makes a reasonable inference that Hypothesis 1 is more likely, but its reasoning overstates what can be concluded from the original observation. The revised output maintains the same conclusion but provides a more precise justification that acknowledges the limitations of what can be inferred from the observation alone. This helps avoid inconsistency with the counterfactual scenario where John hears the vase break before entering."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the Counterfactual Consistency Prompting method does not yield significant improvements over the baselines, consider the following steps:\n1. Analyze the generated counterfactuals to assess their quality and diversity. If the counterfactuals are too similar to the original scenarios or do not introduce meaningful variations, refine the counterfactual generation prompt to encourage more diverse and informative counterfactuals.\n2. Examine the consistency verification step to check if the model is accurately identifying contradictions and inconsistencies. If the model struggles with this step, consider providing more explicit instructions or examples of what constitutes a contradiction.\n3. Evaluate the revised outputs to determine if they effectively resolve the identified inconsistencies. If the revisions are insufficient or introduce new inconsistencies, iterate on the revision prompt to provide clearer guidance on how to revise the output.\n4. If the method still does not show promising results, conduct an error analysis to identify common failure modes and sources of inconsistency. Use these insights to inform the development of alternative prompting strategies or refinements to the existing approach.\n5. Consider exploring variations of the method, such as generating multiple revised outputs and selecting the most consistent one, or incorporating additional prompts for the model to self-assess the consistency of its outputs.\nBy systematically analyzing the limitations of the proposed method and iterating on the approach, the project can still yield valuable insights into the challenges of improving consistency in language model outputs and guide future research directions."
