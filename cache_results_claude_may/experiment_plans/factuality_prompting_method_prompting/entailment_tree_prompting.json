        "Problem": "LLMs can generate false statements that are not logically entailed by the given context or not consistent with each other. Existing methods do not explicitly model the logical structure of the generated text.",
        "Existing Methods": "Datasets like EntailmentBank and CLUTRR evaluate logical entailment in generated text. Baselines include standard language modeling and inconsistency detection methods.",
        "Motivation": "We can prompt LLMs to generate texts that form a valid entailment tree, where each sentence is entailed by the conjunction of its parent sentences and the initial context. This ensures the logical consistency of the generated text.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose entailment tree prompting, where starting from the initial context as the root, we prompt the LLM to generate child sentences that are entailed by the parent sentences. For each generated sentence, we prompt the LLM to score its entailment likelihood given the parent sentences. If the score is low, the sentence is discarded. We recursively prompt the LLM to generate entailed sentences until reaching a maximum depth or no more sentences can be generated. The final generated text is the conjunction of all sentences in the entailment tree. The entailment scores can be used to quantify the logical validity of the generated text.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on logical entailment datasets like EntailmentBank and CLUTRR. Compare with baselines like standard language modeling and inconsistency detection methods. Metrics include entailment accuracy and human evaluation of logical coherence."

        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate false statements that are not logically entailed by the given context or not consistent with each other. Existing methods do not explicitly model the logical structure of the generated text.",
        "Motivation": "Datasets like EntailmentBank and CLUTRR evaluate logical entailment in generated text, but current language modeling and inconsistency detection methods do not perform well on these tasks. We can leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs themselves to generate texts that form a valid entailment tree, where each sentence is entailed by the conjunction of its parent sentences and the initial context. This ensures the logical consistency of the generated text.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose entailment tree prompting, where starting from the initial context as the root, we prompt the LLM to generate child sentences that are entailed by the parent sentences. For each generated sentence, we prompt the LLM to score its entailment likelihood given the parent sentences. If the score is low, the sentence is discarded. We recursively prompt the LLM to generate entailed sentences until reaching a maximum depth or no more sentences can be generated. The final generated text is the conjunction of all sentences in the entailment tree. The entailment scores can be used to quantify the logical validity of the generated text.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate on logical entailment datasets like EntailmentBank and CLUTRR. EntailmentBank contains entailment trees for reasoning about scientific facts. CLUTRR contains entailment trees for family relationships. Use the test sets for evaluation.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For the baseline, use standard left-to-right language modeling prompts, e.g., 'Given the context, generate the next sentence:'. For the proposed method:\n1. Root Prompt: Concatenate the initial context with 'Generate a sentence that can be logically entailed from the above context:'\n2. Recursive Prompt: Concatenate the parent sentences with 'Generate a sentence that can be logically entailed from the above sentences:'\n3. Entailment Scoring Prompt: Concatenate the parent sentences and the candidate child sentence with 'On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is not at all entailed and 5 is strongly entailed, score how much the last sentence can be logically entailed from the previous sentences:'",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 via the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each example in the test set:\n1. Use the root prompt to generate the first level child sentences. Keep sentences with entailment score >= 4.\n2. Recursively use the recursive prompt to generate the next level child sentences for each kept sentence from the previous level. Keep sentences with entailment score >= 4.\n3. Repeat step 2 until reaching a maximum depth (e.g., 5) or no more sentences are generated.\n4. Concatenate all the kept sentences to form the final generated text.\n5. Compute the logical entailment accuracy by checking if the generated text forms a valid entailment tree according to the gold entailment labels in the dataset.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "1. Compare the logical entailment accuracy of the proposed method with the baselines.\n2. Analyze the quality of the generated entailment trees, e.g., the average depth, the number of generated sentences, the average entailment score, etc.\n3. Perform human evaluation on a subset of examples to assess the logical coherence and factual correctness of the generated texts."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Context: Alice is Bob's sister. Bob is Charlie's father. Charlie is David's brother. David is Emily's son.\nGenerate a continuation of the context:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Alice is Emily's aunt. Emily is Charlie's niece. Bob is Emily's grandfather. Alice and Charlie are not directly related.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Root)": "Context: Alice is Bob's sister. Bob is Charlie's father. Charlie is David's brother. David is Emily's son.\nGenerate a sentence that can be logically entailed from the above context:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Root)": "Alice is Charlie's aunt.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Entailment Scoring)": "Sentences: Alice is Bob's sister. Bob is Charlie's father. Charlie is David's brother. David is Emily's son. Alice is Charlie's aunt. Alice is Emily's great aunt.\nCandidate: Bob is Emily's grandfather.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is not at all entailed and 5 is strongly entailed, score how much the last sentence can be logically entailed from the previous sentences:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Entailment Scoring)": "5",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Recursive)": "Sentences: Alice is Bob's sister. Bob is Charlie's father. Charlie is David's brother. David is Emily's son. Alice is Charlie's aunt. Alice is Emily's great aunt.\nGenerate a sentence that can be logically entailed from the above sentences:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Recursive)": "Bob is Emily's grandfather.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Final Output)": "Context: Alice is Bob's sister. Bob is Charlie's father. Charlie is David's brother. David is Emily's son.\nGenerated Entailment Tree:\n- Alice is Charlie's aunt.\n- Alice is Emily's great aunt.\n- Bob is Emily's grandfather.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline output contains sentences that are not entailed by the context (e.g., 'Alice and Charlie are not directly related'). The proposed method generates an entailment tree where each sentence is entailed by the conjunction of its parent sentences and the initial context, leading to a more logically consistent output."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed entailment tree prompting method does not outperform the baselines, we can perform the following analyses:\n1. Check the quality of the generated sentences at each level of the tree. Are they actually entailed by the parent sentences? Are they relevant to the context? Are they factually correct?\n2. Analyze the entailment scores. Are they accurate in measuring the logical entailment? Can we use a different entailment scoring method?\n3. Vary the hyperparameters such as the maximum depth, the entailment score threshold, the prompt templates, etc. Do they affect the performance?\n4. Try different ways to combine the sentences into the final output. Instead of concatenation, can we use a tree-structured decoder to generate the final output?\nBased on the analysis, we can propose improvements to the method, such as better prompting strategies, alternative entailment scoring methods, or different decoding algorithms. If the improved methods still do not work well, we can turn the project into an analysis paper that investigates the challenges and limitations of using entailment tree prompting for language model generation, and propose future directions to address these challenges."
