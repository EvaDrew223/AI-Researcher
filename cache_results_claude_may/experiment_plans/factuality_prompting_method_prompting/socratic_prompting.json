        "Problem": "Large language models often generate shallow and superficial responses that lack deep understanding and reasoning, leading to factual inconsistencies and logical fallacies.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving the reasoning abilities of language models mainly focus on using chain-of-thought prompting and incorporating external knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "We draw inspiration from the Socratic method, a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. We hypothesize that by incorporating Socratic questioning into the prompting process, we can guide the model to generate more thoughtful and well-reasoned responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Socratic Prompting (SP), a novel prompting method that incorporates Socratic questioning into the generation process. SP consists of three main steps: 1) Socratic Question Generation: Given an input prompt, we first generate a set of Socratic questions that probe the model's understanding and reasoning process, such as \"What are the assumptions behind this statement?\" and \"Can you provide evidence to support your claim?\" 2) Socratic Dialogue Prompting: We then engage the model in a Socratic dialogue by asking it to answer the generated questions and provide justifications for its responses. We alternate between question generation and answering until the model reaches a satisfactory level of understanding and reasoning. 3) Final Response Generation: Based on the Socratic dialogue, we ask the model to generate a final response that incorporates the insights and reasoning from the dialogue.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We plan to evaluate SP on a range of tasks that require deep understanding and reasoning, such as argument generation, debating, and persuasive writing. We will compare SP with state-of-the-art baselines, including chain-of-thought prompting and methods that incorporate external knowledge. We will also conduct human evaluation to assess the depth and quality of the reasoning in the generated responses, as well as the effectiveness of the Socratic questioning in eliciting critical thinking."

        "Title": "Socratic Prompting: Guiding Language Models to Reason Deeply via Socratic Questioning",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often generate shallow and superficial responses that lack deep understanding and reasoning, leading to factual inconsistencies and logical fallacies.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for improving the reasoning abilities of language models mainly focus on using chain-of-thought prompting and incorporating external knowledge. However, these methods still struggle to guide the model to engage in deep reasoning and critical thinking. We draw inspiration from the Socratic method, a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. We hypothesize that by incorporating Socratic questioning into the prompting process, we can guide the model to generate more thoughtful and well-reasoned responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Socratic Prompting (SP), a novel prompting method that incorporates Socratic questioning into the generation process.

We alternate between question generation and answering until the model reaches a satisfactory level of understanding and reasoning. 3) Final Response Generation: Based on the Socratic dialogue, we ask the model to generate a final response that incorporates the insights and reasoning from the dialogue.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We evaluate SP on a range of tasks that require deep understanding and reasoning, including: 1) Argument Generation: We use the Argument Reasoning Comprehension (ARC) dataset, which consists of two-sentence arguments with warrants. The goal is to generate the implicit warrants that justify the reasoning from the claim to the conclusion. 2) Debating: We use the IBM-EviDebate dataset, which contains pairs of evidence and claims. The task is to determine whether the evidence supports or opposes the claim and generate a response explaining the reasoning. 3) Persuasive Writing: We use the Persuasive Opinion Text (PersuadeMe) dataset, which consists of opinion articles on various topics. The task is to generate persuasive arguments that support or oppose the main thesis of each article.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each task, we construct the following prompts:\n1) Baseline Prompt: We use a simple prompt that asks the model to generate a response directly based on the input, without any additional guidance.\n2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompt: We use a CoT prompt that asks the model to generate a step-by-step reasoning process before providing the final response.\n3) Socratic Prompting (SP): We implement the three-step SP process as described in the Proposed Method section. For Socratic Question Generation, we use a set of pre-defined question templates based on common types of Socratic questions, such as \"What are the counterarguments to this claim?\" and \"How does this relate to other ideas we have discussed?\" We fill in the templates with relevant content from the input prompt. For Socratic Dialogue Prompting, we alternate between question answering and question generation for a fixed number of turns (e.g., 3-5 turns). For Final Response Generation, we provide the model with the full Socratic dialogue and ask it to generate a final response.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We experiment with state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and LLaMA-2-70B-chat.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate Results": "For each task and model combination, we generate responses using the baseline, CoT, and SP prompts. We evaluate the quality of the generated responses using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. For automatic evaluation, we use metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore to measure the similarity between the generated responses and the reference responses in the datasets. For human evaluation, we ask human raters to assess the responses in terms of various criteria, such as relevance, coherence, persuasiveness, and depth of reasoning. We also ask the raters to directly compare the responses generated by different prompting methods and indicate their preference.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We compare the performance of SP with the baseline and CoT prompts across all tasks and models. We hypothesize that SP will outperform the baseline and CoT prompts in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation, especially on tasks that require deep reasoning and critical thinking. We also analyze the Socratic dialogues generated by SP to gain insights into how the questioning process helps to guide the model's reasoning and improve the quality of the final responses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Input": "Claim: We should ban the sale of violent video games to minors. Reason: Violent video games can increase aggression in children.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Generate a response to the above claim and reason.",
                "Baseline Output": "I agree that we should ban the sale of violent video games to minors. Exposure to violent content at a young age can have negative effects on children's behavior and mental health. It's important to protect children from potentially harmful influences.",
                "CoT Prompt": "Generate a step-by-step reasoning process to analyze the above claim and reason, and then provide a final response.",
                "CoT Output": "Step 1: The claim is that we should ban the sale of violent video games to minors. Step 2: The reason provided is that violent video games can increase aggression in children. Step 3: There is some research suggesting a link between violent video games and increased aggression, but the evidence is mixed and the effects are likely small. Step 4: Banning the sale of violent video games to minors may help protect some children, but it also raises concerns about freedom of speech and expression. Step 5: Parents and caregivers should play a primary role in monitoring and regulating children's access to violent video games. Final response: While there are concerns about the potential negative effects of violent video games on children, an outright ban may not be the most appropriate solution. Parents and caregivers should take responsibility for supervising children's gaming habits and making informed decisions about what content is appropriate. More research is needed to fully understand the impact of violent video games on aggression and other outcomes in children.",
                "SP Prompt": "Let's analyze the claim and reason using Socratic questioning. First, generate three Socratic questions to probe the assumptions and implications of the claim and reason. Then, provide a response to each question. Finally, generate a conclusive response that incorporates the insights from the Socratic dialogue.",
                "SP Output": "Socratic Questions:\n1. What evidence supports the claim that violent video games increase aggression in children? Are there any studies that suggest otherwise?\n2. How do we define \"violent\" video games? Is there a clear distinction between acceptable and unacceptable levels of violence?\n3. What are the potential unintended consequences of banning the sale of violent video games to minors? Could it lead to increased interest or underground distribution?\n\nResponses:\n1. While some studies have found a correlation between playing violent video games and increased aggressive behavior, the evidence is mixed. Other factors, such as family environment and mental health, also play a role. More research is needed to establish a causal link.\n2. The definition of \"violent\" video games is subjective and can vary widely. Games with cartoonish or unrealistic violence may have different effects than those with graphic, realistic violence. It's important to consider the context and intensity of the violence.\n3. Banning the sale of violent video games to minors could have unintended consequences. It may create a \"forbidden fruit\" effect, increasing children's interest in and desire for the banned games. It could also lead to the development of an underground market or encourage children to access the games through other means, such as online downloads or borrowing from older friends.\n\nFinal Response:\nThe claim that violent video games increase aggression in children is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While some research suggests a link, the evidence is not conclusive and other factors likely play a role. Banning the sale of violent video games to minors may seem like a straightforward solution, but it could have unintended consequences and may not address the underlying issues. A more nuanced approach that involves parental guidance, media literacy education, and open dialogue about the content and context of video game violence may be more effective. It's important to empower parents and caregivers to make informed decisions and to provide children with the skills to critically engage with media content. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of violent video games on children's development and behavior.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline prompt generates a simple response that agrees with the claim without much reasoning. The CoT prompt improves upon this by breaking down the reasoning process, but still lacks depth in considering alternative perspectives and implications. The SP prompt generates a Socratic dialogue that probes the assumptions and implications of the claim and reason, leading to a more nuanced and well-reasoned final response. The Socratic questioning helps to surface important considerations, such as the mixed evidence, the subjectivity of defining \"violent\" games, and the potential unintended consequences of a ban. The final response incorporates these insights to provide a balanced and thoughtful perspective on the issue."

            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input": "Claim: Social media platforms should be held legally responsible for the spread of misinformation on their platforms. Reason: Social media companies have the power and resources to monitor and control the content shared on their platforms.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Generate a response to the above claim and reason.",
                "Baseline Output": "I disagree with holding social media platforms legally responsible for the spread of misinformation. While they have the power to monitor content, it's ultimately the responsibility of users to critically evaluate the information they encounter online. Social media companies should not be expected to police all content shared by millions of users.",
                "CoT Prompt": "Generate a step-by-step reasoning process to analyze the above claim and reason, and then provide a final response.",
                "CoT Output": "Step 1: The claim states that social media platforms should be held legally responsible for the spread of misinformation on their platforms. Step 2: The reason given is that social media companies have the power and resources to monitor and control the content shared on their platforms. Step 3: Social media platforms do have the technical capability to monitor and potentially remove misinformation, but this raises concerns about censorship and free speech. Step 4: Determining what constitutes misinformation can be subjective and politically charged, making it difficult for social media companies to make consistent and fair decisions. Step 5: Holding social media companies legally responsible could lead to overly aggressive content moderation and have a chilling effect on online discourse. Final response: While social media companies have a role to play in combating the spread of misinformation, holding them legally responsible is problematic. It places an excessive burden on these companies to police content and make subjective judgments about truth and falsity. This could lead to censorship and have unintended consequences for free speech online. A better approach may be to focus on media literacy education, fact-checking resources, and collaborative efforts between social media companies, journalists, and researchers to identify and counter misinformation.",
                "SP Prompt": "Let's analyze the claim and reason using Socratic questioning. First, generate three Socratic questions to probe the assumptions and implications of the claim and reason. Then, provide a response to each question. Finally, generate a conclusive response that incorporates the insights from the Socratic dialogue.",
                "SP Output": "Socratic Questions:\n1. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of holding social media companies legally responsible for misinformation? How do we balance concerns about misinformation with free speech and open discourse?\n2. How would legal liability for misinformation impact the way social media platforms moderate content? What are the risks of over-censorship or biased moderation?\n3. Are there alternative approaches to combating misinformation on social media that don't involve legal liability? What role can users, educators, and other stakeholders play?\n\nResponses:\n1. Holding social media companies legally responsible could incentivize them to take stronger actions against misinformation, potentially reducing its spread. However, it could also lead to over-censorship and have a chilling effect on free speech. Social media companies may become overly cautious and remove content that is controversial but not necessarily false. This could stifle open discourse and lead to a sanitized online environment that favors certain perspectives over others.\n2. Legal liability would likely lead social media platforms to adopt more aggressive content moderation practices. They may rely heavily on automated algorithms to flag and remove potential misinformation, which could result in false positives and the removal of legitimate content. Human moderators may also face pressure to make quick judgments and err on the side of removal to avoid legal risk. This could amplify existing concerns about bias and inconsistency in content moderation.\n3. There are alternative approaches to combating misinformation that don't rely on legal liability. Improving media literacy education could help users develop the skills to critically evaluate information online. Fact-checking organizations and journalists can play a role in identifying and debunking misinformation. Social media companies can invest in research and partnerships to better understand the spread of misinformation and develop targeted interventions. Collaborative efforts between stakeholders, such as the development of shared standards and best practices, could also be effective.\n\nFinal Response:\nHolding social media companies legally responsible for the spread of misinformation on their platforms is a complex issue with significant implications for free speech and content moderation. While it's important to address the problem of misinformation, legal liability may not be the most effective or desirable solution. It could lead to over-censorship, biased moderation, and a chilling effect on online discourse. Alternative approaches, such as improving media literacy education, supporting fact-checking efforts, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders, may be more promising. Social media companies have a responsibility to address misinformation, but this should be balanced with respect for free speech and open dialogue. A multi-stakeholder approach that engages users, educators, researchers, and civil society can help to create a more resilient and informed online environment. Ultimately, combating misinformation requires a collective effort and a commitment to the values of truth, transparency, and critical thinking.",
                "Explanation": "The SP prompt generates a Socratic dialogue that explores the nuances and implications of holding social media companies legally responsible for misinformation. The questions probe the potential benefits and drawbacks, the impact on content moderation, and alternative approaches. The responses highlight the risks of over-censorship, biased moderation, and the chilling effect on free speech. They also suggest alternative approaches, such as media literacy education and collaborative efforts. The final response incorporates these insights to provide a balanced perspective that acknowledges the importance of addressing misinformation while also respecting free speech and open dialogue. The Socratic questioning leads to a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis compared to the baseline and CoT prompts."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Socratic Prompting method does not outperform the baselines, we can conduct additional analyses to understand why. Some potential avenues for investigation include:\n\n1. Analyzing the quality and relevance of the generated Socratic questions. If the questions are not probing the key assumptions and implications of the input prompts, they may not be effective in guiding the model's reasoning. We can manually evaluate a sample of the generated questions and compare them to human-written Socratic questions to identify areas for improvement.\n\n2. Examining the coherence and depth of the Socratic dialogues. If the model's responses to the Socratic questions are shallow, inconsistent, or fail to build upon each other, the final response may not reflect genuine reasoning. We can analyze the dialogues to identify patterns of success and failure, and potentially develop additional prompting techniques to encourage more coherent and progressive dialogues.\n\n3. Comparing the performance of Socratic Prompting across different models and parameter sizes. If the method works well for some models but not others, it may indicate that certain architectures or training paradigms are more amenable to Socratic questioning. We can conduct experiments to isolate the effects of model choice and identify the characteristics of models that respond well to Socratic Prompting.\n\n4. Investigating the impact of domain knowledge on the effectiveness of Socratic Prompting. If the method performs poorly on tasks that require specialized knowledge or technical understanding, it may suggest that the model's background knowledge is insufficient to engage in meaningful Socratic questioning. We can explore ways to incorporate domain-specific information into the prompts or fine-tune the models on relevant datasets to improve their ability to reason about complex topics.\n\nIf these analyses fail to yield insights that can improve the effectiveness of Socratic Prompting, we can still leverage the generated Socratic dialogues as a valuable dataset for studying the reasoning capabilities and limitations of language models. By comparing the dialogues to human-written Socratic questioning, we can identify patterns of success and failure, common reasoning pitfalls, and opportunities for future research. This can contribute to the broader goal of developing more transparent and interpretable language models that can engage in robust reasoning and critical thinking."
