        "Problem": "Large language models can generate fluent text that lacks factual grounding, especially when generating long-form responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods include incorporating retrieval and using learned fact-checking models.",
        "Motivation": "Socratic questioning is a technique used to probe assumptions, expose contradictions, and encourage deeper reasoning. We can use Socratic probing to guide LLMs towards more factual and coherent generation.",
        "Proposed Method": "The procedure involves: 1) Generating an initial response to a query. 2) Prompting the model with a series of targeted Socratic questions about the generated text, e.g., 'What is the source of this claim?', 'Is there any evidence that contradicts this?', 'Are there any implicit assumptions being made?'. 3) Using the model's answers to these probes to score the factuality of each sentence. 4) Prompting the model to refine the low-scoring sentences using retrieved evidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on long-form QA datasets like ELI5 and Wikihow. Compare to baselines like vanilla prompting and retrieval-augmented generation. Metrics include factuality scores from a learned fact-checker, and human evaluation of factual consistency and coherence."

        "Title": "Socratic Probing: Guiding Language Models to Factual and Coherent Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate fluent text that lacks factual grounding, especially when generating long-form responses. This can lead to hallucination and inconsistency in the generated text.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods to address this issue include incorporating retrieval and using learned fact-checking models. However, these approaches often require additional training or external knowledge sources. Socratic questioning is a technique used to probe assumptions, expose contradictions, and encourage deeper reasoning. By using Socratic probing to guide LLMs during generation, we aim to improve the factuality and coherence of the generated text without relying on external resources or additional training.",
        "Proposed Method": "The Socratic Probing procedure involves the following steps:\n1. Generate an initial response to a query using the LLM.\n2. Prompt the model with a series of targeted Socratic questions about the generated text, e.g., 'What is the source of this claim?', 'Is there any evidence that contradicts this?', 'Are there any implicit assumptions being made?'.\n3. Use the model's answers to these probes to score the factuality of each sentence in the generated response.\n4. Prompt the model to refine the low-scoring sentences using retrieved evidence or by generating more coherent alternatives.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until a satisfactory level of factuality and coherence is achieved.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Evaluate the proposed method on long-form question-answering datasets such as ELI5 and Wikihow. These datasets contain open-ended questions that require multi-sentence explanations, making them suitable for assessing the factuality and coherence of generated responses.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Models": "Compare the performance of Socratic Probing to the following baselines:\n1. Vanilla prompting: Generate responses directly from the LLM without any additional probing or refinement.\n2. Retrieval-augmented generation: Use a retrieval model to find relevant passages from an external knowledge source (e.g., Wikipedia) and condition the LLM on these passages during generation.",
            "Step 3: Socratic Question Generation": "Design a set of Socratic question templates that probe various aspects of factuality and coherence, such as:\n- 'What is the source of this claim?'\n- 'Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts this statement?'\n- 'Are there any implicit assumptions being made here?'\n- 'How does this sentence relate to the previous one?'\n- 'Is this information relevant to answering the original question?'\nPrompt the LLM to generate specific Socratic questions by filling in these templates with sentences from the generated response.",
            "Step 4: Factuality Scoring": "Use the LLM's answers to the Socratic questions to assign a factuality score to each sentence in the generated response. For example, if the model cannot provide a credible source for a claim or identifies contradictory evidence, the corresponding sentence should receive a low factuality score.",
            "Step 5: Response Refinement": "For sentences with low factuality scores, prompt the LLM to refine them by either:\n1. Retrieving relevant evidence from an external knowledge source and conditioning the model on this evidence to generate a more factual alternative.\n2. Prompting the model to generate a more coherent alternative that better fits the context of the surrounding sentences.",
            "Step 6: Iteration": "Repeat steps 3-5 for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 3) or until a satisfactory level of factuality and coherence is achieved (e.g., all sentences have a factuality score above a certain threshold).",
            "Step 7: Evaluation Metrics": "Evaluate the generated responses using the following metrics:\n1. Factuality: Use a learned fact-checking model to assess the factual accuracy of the generated text. Alternatively, manually annotate a subset of the responses for factual correctness.\n2. Coherence: Use a learned coherence model or human evaluation to assess the logical flow and consistency of the generated responses.\n3. Relevance: Manually evaluate whether the generated responses adequately answer the original question.",
            "Step 8: Model Selection": "Experiment with different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) to assess the effectiveness of Socratic Probing across various model sizes and architectures."

            "Test Case 1": {
                "Query": "How do airplanes fly?",
                "Baseline Output": "Airplanes fly by generating lift using their wings. The wings are shaped like an airfoil, which means they are curved on top and flatter on the bottom. This shape causes the air moving over the wing to travel faster than the air moving under the wing, creating an area of low pressure above the wing. The higher air pressure beneath the wing pushes the plane upward, overcoming gravity and allowing the plane to fly. The engines of the plane propel it forward, which also helps generate lift by forcing air over the wings. The pilot controls the plane using various surfaces such as the rudder, ailerons, and elevators, which change the shape of the wings and tail to steer and maintain stable flight.",
                "Socratic Probing": {
                    "Question 1": "What is the source of the claim that wings are shaped like an airfoil?",
                    "Answer 1": "The shape of airplane wings being similar to an airfoil is a well-established fact in aerodynamics and can be found in many educational resources and scientific publications on the topic.",
                    "Question 2": "Is there any evidence that contradicts the statement about air pressure differences causing lift?",
                    "Answer 2": "No, the explanation of lift being generated by a pressure difference due to the shape of the wing is widely accepted and supported by scientific evidence.",
                    "Question 3": "Are there any implicit assumptions made about the role of the plane's engines?",
                    "Answer 3": "The response assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of how engines work to propel the plane forward. It could be made more explicit that the engines generate thrust, which is necessary to maintain the airflow over the wings and generate lift.",
                    "Refined Output": "Airplanes fly by generating lift using their wings. The wings are shaped like an airfoil, which is a design that is curved on top and flatter on the bottom. This shape causes the air moving over the wing to travel faster than the air moving under the wing, creating an area of low pressure above the wing. The higher air pressure beneath the wing pushes the plane upward, overcoming gravity and allowing the plane to fly. This principle is known as Bernoulli's law and is well-established in aerodynamics.\n\nThe engines of the plane generate thrust to propel it forward, which is necessary to maintain the airflow over the wings and generate lift. As the plane moves through the air, the shape of the wings forces the air to move faster over the top of the wing, creating the pressure difference that generates lift.\n\nThe pilot controls the plane using various control surfaces such as the rudder, ailerons, and elevators. These surfaces change the shape of the wings and tail to steer the plane and maintain stable flight. By adjusting these controls, the pilot can change the amount of lift generated and the direction of the plane's movement."

            "Test Case 2": {
                "Query": "What is the process of photosynthesis in plants?",
                "Baseline Output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the plant's growth and development. The process takes place primarily in the leaves of the plant, where specialized structures called chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses the energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a simple sugar that the plant can use for energy. Oxygen is released as a byproduct of this process.\n\nThe overall equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nThis means that six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and six molecules of water (H2O) are converted into one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) and six molecules of oxygen (O2) using light energy.\n\nThe process of photosynthesis occurs in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and the energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released as a waste product, while the hydrogen is used to create energy-carrying molecules called ATP and NADPH.\n\nIn the light-independent reactions, the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of chemical reactions known as the Calvin cycle. This process occurs in the stroma, the fluid surrounding the thylakoids in the chloroplast.\n\nPhotosynthesis is essential for life on Earth, as it provides the energy that is used by nearly all living things to fuel their growth and development. It also plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and replacing it with oxygen, which is necessary for most forms of life to survive.",

                    "Question 1": "What is the source of the claim that photosynthesis takes place primarily in the leaves of plants?",
                    "Answer 1": "The fact that photosynthesis occurs mainly in plant leaves is widely accepted and can be found in many scientific textbooks and publications on the subject.",
                    "Question 2": "Is there any evidence that contradicts the equation for photosynthesis?",
                    "Answer 2": "No, the overall equation for photosynthesis (6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2) is well-established and supported by extensive scientific evidence.",
                    "Question 3": "Are there any implicit assumptions made about the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis?",
                    "Answer 3": "The response assumes that the reader has some prior knowledge of what chlorophyll is and its role in absorbing sunlight. It could be made more explicit that chlorophyll is essential for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis and that it is responsible for the green color of most plants.",
                    "Question 4": "How does the information about the Calvin cycle relate to the overall process of photosynthesis?",
                    "Answer 4": "The Calvin cycle, also known as the light-independent reactions, is a crucial part of the photosynthesis process. It uses the energy-carrying molecules (ATP and NADPH) produced in the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. By explaining the Calvin cycle, the response provides a more complete picture of how photosynthesis works.",
                    "Refined Output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organism's activities. In plants, photosynthesis occurs primarily in the leaves, where specialized structures called chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is essential for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, as it absorbs sunlight and uses the energy to drive the production of energy-carrying molecules (ATP and NADPH).\n\nThe overall equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2. This means that six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and six molecules of water (H2O) are converted into one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) and six molecules of oxygen (O2) using light energy. This equation is a simplified representation of the complex series of chemical reactions that occur during photosynthesis.\n\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The energy from the sunlight is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released as a byproduct, while the hydrogen ions (protons) are used to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient is then used to power the synthesis of ATP and NADPH.\n\nIn the light-independent reactions, which take place in the stroma of the chloroplast, the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of enzymatic reactions known as the Calvin cycle. The key enzyme in this process is RuBisCO (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase), which catalyzes the fixation of carbon dioxide to a 5-carbon sugar called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). The fixed carbon is then reduced to form 3-carbon sugars, which are eventually converted into glucose and other organic compounds that the plant can use for energy and growth.\n\nPhotosynthesis is a vital process for life on Earth, as it provides the energy that is used by nearly all living things to fuel their growth and development. It also plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and replacing it with oxygen, which is necessary for most forms of life to survive. Understanding the mechanisms of photosynthesis is essential for developing strategies to improve crop yields, mitigate the effects of climate change, and develop sustainable sources of energy."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Socratic Probing method does not significantly improve the factuality and coherence of the generated responses compared to the baselines, there are several alternative approaches that could be explored:\n\n1. Analyze the generated Socratic questions and answers to identify potential weaknesses in the probing process. For example, if the questions are not sufficiently probing or the answers are not informative enough, the probing templates or scoring criteria may need to be adjusted.\n\n2. Experiment with different types of Socratic questions that focus on other aspects of factuality and coherence, such as logical consistency, relevance to the original query, or the presence of contradictory statements.\n\n3. Investigate alternative methods for refining the generated responses based on the Socratic probing results. For example, instead of using retrieved evidence or generating coherent alternatives, the model could be prompted to directly edit the problematic sentences or to provide explanations for why certain statements are factual or non-factual.\n\n4. Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the types of factual errors and coherence issues that occur in the generated responses, and use this information to develop targeted probing strategies or post-processing techniques.\n\n5. Explore the use of external knowledge sources or fact-checking models to augment the Socratic Probing process, while still maintaining the focus on using the LLM's own knowledge and reasoning capabilities.\n\n6. Consider alternative evaluation metrics or human evaluation protocols to better assess the factuality and coherence of the generated responses, as the current metrics may not fully capture the effectiveness of the Socratic Probing method.\n\nIf these alternative approaches do not yield satisfactory results, the project could be adapted into an analysis of the limitations of using Socratic Probing for improving the factuality and coherence of LLM-generated responses. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the challenges of controlling the output of LLMs and guide future research on more effective methods for ensuring factual accuracy and logical consistency in generated text."
