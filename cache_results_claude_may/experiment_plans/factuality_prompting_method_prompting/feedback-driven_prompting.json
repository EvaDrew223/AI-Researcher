    "idea_name": "Feedback-Driven Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often generate factually incorrect information, especially when the input query is complex or ambiguous.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for improving factuality include using external knowledge bases, generating self-consistency checks, or using reinforcement learning with human feedback.",
        "Motivation": "Instead of relying on external resources or expensive human feedback, we can leverage the model's own ability to self-reflect and identify potential errors in its generated output. By prompting the model to provide feedback on its own response and then incorporating that feedback into a revised response, we can iteratively improve the factuality of the generated text.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting approach called Feedback-Driven Prompting (FDP). Given an input query, FDP first prompts the model to generate an initial response. Then, it prompts the model to provide specific feedback on the initial response, focusing on identifying any factual errors, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims. Finally, FDP prompts the model to generate a revised response that incorporates the feedback and addresses the identified issues. This process can be repeated for multiple iterations until a satisfactory response is generated.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate FDP on a range of factual question-answering datasets, such as Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and WebQuestions. We will compare FDP to baseline methods such as direct prompting and self-consistency prompting, as well as state-of-the-art methods that use external knowledge bases. We will measure factuality using both automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU) and human evaluation."

        "Title": "Feedback-Driven Prompting: Iterative Refinement of Language Model Outputs Using Self-Reflection",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often generate factually incorrect information, especially when the input query is complex or ambiguous. This can lead to the generation of false or misleading information, which is problematic in many applications that require high factual accuracy.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for improving factuality, such as using external knowledge bases, generating self-consistency checks, or using reinforcement learning with human feedback, rely on external resources or expensive human annotations. Instead, we propose leveraging the model's own ability to self-reflect and identify potential errors in its generated output. By prompting the model to provide feedback on its own response and then incorporating that feedback into a revised response, we can iteratively improve the factuality of the generated text without relying on external resources or human feedback.",
        "Proposed Method": "Feedback-Driven Prompting (FDP) is a multi-step prompting approach that iteratively refines the model's output using self-reflection. Given an input query, FDP first prompts the model to generate an initial response. Then, it prompts the model to provide specific feedback on the initial response, focusing on identifying any factual errors, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims. Finally, FDP prompts the model to generate a revised response that incorporates the feedback and addresses the identified issues. This process can be repeated for multiple iterations until a satisfactory response is generated.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate FDP on a range of factual question-answering datasets, such as Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and WebQuestions. These datasets contain complex questions that require the model to generate accurate and factual responses.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For the baseline methods, use direct prompting (i.e., simply providing the input query to the model) and self-consistency prompting (i.e., prompting the model to generate multiple responses and selecting the most consistent one). For FDP, construct prompts for each step of the iterative process:\n1. Initial Response Generation: Prompt the model to generate an initial response to the input query.\n2. Feedback Generation: Prompt the model to provide specific feedback on the initial response, focusing on identifying factual errors, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims. Example prompt: \"Please identify any factual errors, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims in the following response: [initial response]\"\n3. Response Refinement: Prompt the model to generate a revised response that incorporates the feedback and addresses the identified issues. Example prompt: \"Based on the following feedback, please generate a revised response that addresses the identified issues: [feedback]\"\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 for multiple iterations until a satisfactory response is generated.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate FDP using state-of-the-art language models such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from OpenAI. These models have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of natural language tasks, including question answering.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each dataset, generate responses using the baseline methods and FDP. For FDP, generate responses for different numbers of iterations (e.g., 1, 2, 3) to evaluate the impact of iterative refinement on factual accuracy.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Measure the factual accuracy of the generated responses using both automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU) and human evaluation. Compare the performance of FDP to the baseline methods and state-of-the-art methods that use external knowledge bases. Analyze the impact of the number of iterations on the factual accuracy of the generated responses."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Input Query": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Baseline Prompt (Direct)": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Baseline Output (Direct)": "The capital of France is Paris.",
                "Baseline Prompt (Self-Consistency)": "What is the capital of France? Please generate 3 responses and select the most consistent one.",
                "Baseline Output (Self-Consistency)": "The capital of France is Paris. Paris is the capital of France. Paris, France's capital, is known for its art, fashion, and cuisine.",
                "FDP Prompt (Initial Response)": "What is the capital of France?",
                "FDP Output (Initial Response)": "The capital of France is Paris, known for its iconic Eiffel Tower.",
                "FDP Prompt (Feedback)": "Please identify any factual errors, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims in the following response: The capital of France is Paris, known for its iconic Eiffel Tower.",
                "FDP Output (Feedback)": "The response is factually correct. Paris is indeed the capital of France and the Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark located in Paris. There are no inconsistencies or unsupported claims.",
                "FDP Prompt (Refined Response)": "Based on the following feedback, please generate a revised response that addresses the identified issues: The response is factually correct. Paris is indeed the capital of France and the Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark located in Paris. There are no inconsistencies or unsupported claims.",
                "FDP Output (Refined Response)": "Paris is the capital of France. It is known for its iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, as well as its art, fashion, and cuisine.",
                "Explanation": "In this example, the initial response generated by FDP is already factually correct, so the feedback indicates that no changes are needed. The refined response maintains the factual accuracy while providing additional relevant information."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Input Query": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
                "Baseline Prompt (Direct)": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
                "Baseline Output (Direct)": "The largest planet in our solar system is Saturn, known for its prominent ring system.",
                "Baseline Prompt (Self-Consistency)": "What is the largest planet in our solar system? Please generate 3 responses and select the most consistent one.",
                "Baseline Output (Self-Consistency)": "The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system. While Saturn is known for its rings, Jupiter is the largest planet.",
                "FDP Prompt (Initial Response)": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
                "FDP Output (Initial Response)": "The largest planet in our solar system is Saturn, with a radius of about 58,232 kilometers.",
                "FDP Prompt (Feedback)": "Please identify any factual errors, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims in the following response: The largest planet in our solar system is Saturn, with a radius of about 58,232 kilometers.",
                "FDP Output (Feedback)": "The response contains a factual error. While Saturn is a large planet, it is not the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is the largest planet, with a radius of about 69,911 kilometers, which is significantly larger than Saturn's radius.",
                "FDP Prompt (Refined Response)": "Based on the following feedback, please generate a revised response that addresses the identified issues: The response contains a factual error. While Saturn is a large planet, it is not the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is the largest planet, with a radius of about 69,911 kilometers, which is significantly larger than Saturn's radius.",
                "FDP Output (Refined Response)": "The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter, with a radius of about 69,911 kilometers. Saturn, while also a large planet known for its prominent ring system, is smaller than Jupiter.",
                "Explanation": "In this example, the initial response generated by FDP contains a factual error, which is identified in the feedback step. The refined response incorporates the feedback to correct the error and provide accurate information about the largest planet in our solar system."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Feedback-Driven Prompting method does not significantly improve factual accuracy compared to the baseline methods, there are several alternative approaches to consider:\n1. Analyze the generated feedback to determine if it is accurately identifying factual errors, inconsistencies, and unsupported claims. If the feedback is not sufficiently specific or accurate, consider modifying the feedback prompts to elicit more targeted and useful feedback.\n2. Evaluate the quality of the refined responses to determine if they are effectively incorporating the feedback and addressing the identified issues. If the refined responses do not show significant improvement, consider modifying the response refinement prompts to encourage more substantial revisions based on the feedback.\n3. Experiment with different numbers of iterations and analyze the impact on factual accuracy. It may be that a different number of iterations is optimal for different types of queries or datasets.\n4. Consider incorporating additional prompting techniques, such as providing more context or examples in the prompts, to guide the model towards generating more factually accurate responses.\n5. If the proposed method does not yield significant improvements after these modifications, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of language models in generating factually accurate responses. This could involve conducting error analysis to identify common types of factual errors, inconsistencies, and unsupported claims, and proposing potential solutions or areas for future research."
