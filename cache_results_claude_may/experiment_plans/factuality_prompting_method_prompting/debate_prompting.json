    "idea_name": "Debate Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current language models can fall prey to the phenomenon of 'group think' when asked to verify their own generated outputs, as the model may share the same biases or knowledge gaps across multiple personas that are based on the same model.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods that use a single language model to self-verify its outputs (via techniques such as generating self-consistency scores) are prone to model biases and blindspots.",
        "Motivation": "Debate is a powerful technique used by humans to expose blindspots in their reasoning. By prompting multiple language models to engage in a debate and take different stances on a topic, we can use the disagreements that surface to detect potential inconsistencies and hallucinations in model-generated text.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a debate prompting method involving at least two language models. Given an initial prompt, Model A generates a candidate output. Model B is then prompted to find flaws and counterarguments in Model A's output. Following this, Model A is prompted to refute Model B's arguments, and the debate continues over multiple rounds until a stopping criterion is met. Finally, the arguments for and against the initial output are aggregated and presented to a human judge or a scoring model to determine the validity of the candidate output. The candidate is accepted only if it withstands scrutiny from the debate.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We propose evaluating the debate prompting technique on fact verification datasets such as FEVER and VitaminC, as well as on long-form question answering tasks. Baselines include standard prompting, self-consistency, and techniques from the RAWLSNET (Reinforced Adaptive Writing Loss) framework. Metrics include the accuracy of fact verification and the faithfulness of generated answers (measured via both automatic scoring and human evaluation)."

        "Title": "Debate Prompting: Leveraging Disagreements Between Language Models to Reduce Hallucination",
        "Problem Statement": "Current language models can fall prey to the phenomenon of 'group think' when asked to verify their own generated outputs, as the model may share the same biases or knowledge gaps across multiple personas that are based on the same model. This can lead to the generation of factually incorrect or inconsistent information, known as hallucination.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods that use a single language model to self-verify its outputs (via techniques such as generating self-consistency scores) are prone to model biases and blindspots. Debate is a powerful technique used by humans to expose blindspots in their reasoning. By prompting multiple language models to engage in a debate and take different stances on a topic, we can use the disagreements that surface to detect potential inconsistencies and hallucinations in model-generated text.",

Finally, the arguments for and against the initial output are aggregated and presented to a human judge or a scoring model to determine the validity of the candidate output. The candidate is accepted only if it withstands scrutiny from the debate.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We evaluate the debate prompting technique on fact verification datasets such as FEVER and VitaminC, as well as on long-form question answering tasks such as ELI5 and MS MARCO. These datasets contain claims or questions along with supporting or refuting evidence, which can be used to assess the factual accuracy of the model-generated outputs.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each example in the dataset, we construct a set of prompts for the debate:\n1. Initial Prompt (Model A): The original claim or question from the dataset, e.g., \"The Eiffel Tower is the tallest building in Paris.\"\n2. Critique Prompt (Model B): A prompt to find flaws and counterarguments in Model A's output, e.g., \"Identify any factual inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the following statement: [Model A's output]. Provide evidence to support your arguments.\"\n3. Rebuttal Prompt (Model A): A prompt to refute Model B's critique, e.g., \"Defend the factual accuracy of your original statement in light of the following counterarguments: [Model B's output]. Provide evidence to support your defense.\"\nThe debate continues for a fixed number of rounds or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., both models agree or run out of new arguments).",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We experiment with different pairings of language models for the debate, such as:\n1. GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) vs. GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002)\n2. GPT-4 vs. GPT-4\n3. GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) vs. GPT-4\nWe also compare the performance of the debate prompting method against baselines that use a single model for output generation and verification, such as self-consistency scoring and chain-of-thought prompting.",
            "Step 4: Run the Debate": "For each example in the dataset, we run the debate between the selected pair of models for the specified number of rounds. We record the arguments generated by each model at each round of the debate.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate the Debate Outcome": "We aggregate the arguments for and against the initial output and present them to a human judge or a scoring model to determine the validity of the candidate output. The scoring model can be a pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) model that takes the initial output and the aggregated arguments as input and predicts a label of \"SUPPORTS\", \"REFUTES\", or \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\". We compare the predicted label against the ground truth label from the dataset to assess the accuracy of the debate outcome.",
            "Step 6: Analyze the Results": "We compare the performance of the debate prompting method against the baselines in terms of the accuracy of the final output (as determined by the human judge or scoring model). We also analyze the quality and diversity of the arguments generated by the models during the debate to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. Additionally, we examine the impact of factors such as the choice of models, the number of debate rounds, and the stopping criterion on the effectiveness of the method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Initial Prompt (Model A)": "The Eiffel Tower is the tallest building in Paris.",
                "Ground Truth": "REFUTES",
                "Baseline Output (Self-Consistency)": "The Eiffel Tower is the tallest building in Paris. I am confident this statement is factually accurate. The Eiffel Tower stands at an impressive height of 324 meters, making it the tallest structure in Paris.",
                "Baseline Score": "INCORRECT",
                "Debate Round 1 (Model B)": "The statement \"The Eiffel Tower is the tallest building in Paris\" is inaccurate. While the Eiffel Tower is indeed a tall structure, it is not considered a building. The tallest building in Paris is actually the Tour Montparnasse, which stands at a height of 210 meters.",
                "Debate Round 2 (Model A)": "I concede that my original statement was imprecise. The Eiffel Tower is not a building, but rather a freestanding structure. However, it is still the tallest man-made structure in Paris, surpassing the height of the Tour Montparnasse.",
                "Debate Round 3 (Model B)": "You are correct that the Eiffel Tower is the tallest man-made structure in Paris. However, the original claim specifically referred to the tallest \"building\", which is a distinct category from freestanding structures like towers. Therefore, the statement remains inaccurate.",
                "Debate Outcome": "REFUTES",
                "Explanation": "The debate prompting method successfully identifies the factual inaccuracy in the initial statement by generating counterarguments that highlight the distinction between buildings and freestanding structures. The final outcome correctly refutes the claim, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in reducing hallucination."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Initial Prompt (Model A)": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Model A's Output": "The capital of France is Paris.",
                "Ground Truth": "SUPPORTS",
                "Baseline Output (Chain-of-Thought)": "Let's think step by step:\n1. France is a country located in Western Europe.\n2. The capital of a country is typically its largest and most important city.\n3. Paris is the largest city in France and is known for its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.\n4. Paris is also the seat of the French government and the official residence of the President of France.\nTherefore, the capital of France is Paris.",
                "Baseline Score": "CORRECT",
                "Debate Round 1 (Model B)": "I agree with the statement that Paris is the capital of France. It is a well-established fact that Paris has been the capital of France since the 12th century. The city is the political, cultural, and economic center of the country.",
                "Debate Round 2 (Model A)": "Thank you for confirming the accuracy of my original statement. Paris is indeed the official capital of France, as recognized by the French government and the international community.",
                "Debate Outcome": "SUPPORTS",
                "Explanation": "In this test case, both models agree on the factual accuracy of the initial output. The debate does not generate any counterarguments, indicating that the original statement is well-supported by the models' knowledge. The final outcome correctly supports the claim, aligning with the ground truth label. This example demonstrates that the debate prompting method does not introduce false negatives when the initial output is already factually accurate."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed debate prompting method does not significantly outperform the baselines in reducing hallucination, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality and diversity of the arguments generated by the models during the debate. If the arguments are weak, repetitive, or fail to address the relevant aspects of the claim, we can explore techniques to improve the argument generation process, such as using more targeted prompts or incorporating external knowledge sources.\n2. Investigate the impact of different model pairings on the debate outcome. If certain model combinations consistently underperform, we can experiment with alternative model selection strategies, such as using models with complementary strengths or training specialized models for debate.\n3. Examine the effectiveness of the stopping criterion used in the debate. If the debates are terminating prematurely or continuing for too many rounds without reaching a conclusive outcome, we can adjust the stopping criterion based on factors like argument quality, novelty, or convergence.\n4. Consider incorporating additional verification steps after the debate, such as using the aggregated arguments to guide a final fact-checking process or combining the debate outcome with other hallucination reduction techniques like retrieval-augmented generation.\n5. If the debate prompting method fails to provide significant improvements, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations and failure modes of the approach. This could involve conducting error analysis on the datasets to identify common patterns or challenges, such as claims that require complex reasoning or domain-specific knowledge. The insights gained from this analysis can inform the development of future hallucination reduction techniques."
