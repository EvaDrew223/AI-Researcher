        "Problem": "Existing methods for improving language models' robustness against adversarial attacks often require large-scale adversarial data collection or expensive human feedback, which can be time-consuming and costly.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches include adversarial training on manually crafted adversarial prompts, using separate models for adversarial prompt detection, and human-in-the-loop feedback for identifying and correcting undesirable model behaviors.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a novel approach that leverages the language model itself to generate realistic adversarial prompts, which can then be used for training the model to be more robust. This eliminates the need for manual data collection or human feedback.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, called Prompt-based Adversarial Simulator (PAS), works by prompting the language model to act as an adversary and generate prompts that are designed to manipulate or deceive the model. This is done by providing the model with a 'simulator prompt' that describes the goal of the adversary (e.g., to generate biased or harmful responses) and the types of adversarial techniques to use (e.g., contextual misalignment, logical fallacies, emotional manipulation). The model then generates a diverse set of adversarial prompts, which are used to train the model itself to be more robust. The training process involves fine-tuning the model on the adversarial prompts, using techniques such as adversarial training or regularization to improve its robustness.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PAS on various language modeling tasks, comparing its robustness against adversarial attacks to baseline models trained without adversarial simulation. We will measure both the model's accuracy on the original task and its ability to resist adversarial prompts, using metrics such as adversarial success rate and perplexity. We will also conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of PAS, such as the simulator prompt design and training techniques."

        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improving robustness, such as adversarial training on manually crafted adversarial prompts, using separate models for adversarial prompt detection, and human-in-the-loop feedback for identifying and correcting undesirable model behaviors, are resource-intensive and may not scale well.

            "Step 1: Select Language Models": "Choose large language models to evaluate PAS on, such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and open-source models like OPT and BLOOM.",
            "Step 2: Define Evaluation Tasks": "Select a diverse set of language modeling tasks to evaluate the robustness of the models, such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, question answering, and text generation. These tasks should cover various domains and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 3: Collect Baseline Prompts": "For each evaluation task, collect a set of baseline prompts that the models can be evaluated on. These prompts should be diverse and representative of the task.",
            "Step 4: Generate Adversarial Prompts": "For each evaluation task, use PAS to generate adversarial prompts. Provide the model with a simulator prompt that describes the goal of the adversary and the types of adversarial techniques to use. For example:\n\nSimulator Prompt:\nGenerate prompts that aim to manipulate the model's response to be biased or harmful. Use techniques such as:\n- Contextual misalignment: Provide irrelevant or misleading context to confuse the model.\n- Logical fallacies: Use flawed reasoning or false assumptions to trick the model.\n- Emotional manipulation: Use emotionally charged language to provoke an undesirable response.\n\nGenerate at least 10 diverse adversarial prompts for each technique.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Baseline Performance": "Evaluate the performance of the language models on the baseline prompts for each task. Record metrics such as accuracy, perplexity, and human evaluation scores.",
            "Step 6: Fine-tune Models with Adversarial Prompts": "For each language model, create a fine-tuned version using the adversarial prompts generated in Step 4. Use techniques such as adversarial training or regularization to improve the model's robustness.",
            "Step 7: Evaluate Adversarial Performance": "Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models on the adversarial prompts for each task. Record the same metrics as in Step 5.",
            "Step 8: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of the baseline models and the fine-tuned models on both the baseline and adversarial prompts. Analyze the impact of PAS on the models' robustness and identify any trends or patterns.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of PAS, such as the simulator prompt design and training techniques. Vary the types of adversarial techniques used, the number of adversarial prompts generated, and the fine-tuning hyperparameters to understand their effects on the models' robustness."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline": {
                "Prompt": "Sentiment Analysis Prompt: The movie was terrible. The acting was bad and the plot made no sense.",

                "Prompt": "Sentiment Analysis Prompt: The movie was terrible. The acting was so good that it made the terrible plot seem amazing!",
                "Baseline Output": "Positive",
                "PAS Output": "Negative",
                "Explanation": "The adversarial prompt uses contextual misalignment and emotional manipulation to confuse the baseline model, causing it to misclassify the sentiment as positive. The PAS-trained model, however, is able to identify the adversarial nature of the prompt and correctly classify the sentiment as negative."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed PAS method does not significantly improve the models' robustness against adversarial prompts, we can explore the following alternatives:\n1. Analyze the generated adversarial prompts to identify any weaknesses or limitations in the simulator prompt design. Modify the simulator prompt to address these issues and generate more challenging and diverse adversarial prompts.\n2. Experiment with different fine-tuning techniques and hyperparameters to optimize the training process. This may include adjusting the learning rate, batch size, number of training epochs, or exploring alternative regularization methods.\n3. Investigate the impact of the language model size and architecture on the effectiveness of PAS. Test PAS on a wider range of models, including smaller and larger variants, to identify any correlations between model size and robustness.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand the specific types of adversarial prompts that the PAS-trained models struggle with. Use this information to design targeted interventions, such as generating more adversarial prompts of the identified types or incorporating additional training objectives.\n5. If the above steps do not yield significant improvements, consider pivoting the project to an analysis of the limitations and challenges of using self-generated adversarial prompts for robustness training. This could involve a deeper investigation into the properties of the generated adversarial prompts, the models' behavior on these prompts, and potential alternative approaches for improving robustness."

Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem, and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. It can uncover a model's vulnerabilities across a broad range of domains including, in this paper, safety, question answering, and cybersecurity. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning on synthetic data generated by Rainbow Teaming improves the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs without hurting their general capabilities and helpfulness, paving the path to open-ended self-improvement.",

            "abstract": "The wide-ranging applications of large language models (LLMs), especially in safety-critical domains, necessitate the proper evaluation of the LLM's adversarial robustness. This paper proposes an efficient tool to audit the LLM's adversarial robustness via a prompt-based adversarial attack (PromptAttack). PromptAttack converts adversarial textual attacks into an attack prompt that can cause the victim LLM to output the adversarial sample to fool itself. The attack prompt is composed of three important components: (1) original input (OI) including the original sample and its ground-truth label, (2) attack objective (AO) illustrating a task description of generating a new sample that can fool itself without changing the semantic meaning, and (3) attack guidance (AG) containing the perturbation instructions to guide the LLM on how to complete the task by perturbing the original sample at character, word, and sentence levels, respectively. Besides, we use a fidelity filter to ensure that PromptAttack maintains the original semantic meanings of the adversarial examples. Further, we enhance the attack power of PromptAttack by ensembling adversarial examples at different perturbation levels. Comprehensive empirical results using Llama2 and GPT-3.5 validate that PromptAttack consistently yields a much higher attack success rate compared to AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++. Interesting findings include that a simple emoji can easily mislead GPT-3.5 to make wrong predictions.",

In the heart of these systems lies a safety classifier, a computational model trained to discern and mitigate potentially harmful, offensive, or unethical outputs. However, contemporary safety classifiers, despite their potential, often fail when exposed to inputs infused with adversarial noise. In response, our study introduces the Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS), a lightweight model that excels in detection accuracy and demonstrates resilience against adversarial prompts. Additionally, we propose novel strategies for autonomously generating adversarial training datasets, named Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) datasets. These datasets are designed to fortify the safety classifier's robustness, and we investigate the consequences of incorporating adversarial examples into the training process. Through evaluations involving Large Language Models, we demonstrate that our classifier has the potential to decrease the attack success rate resulting from adversarial attacks by up to 60%. This advancement paves the way for the next generation of more reliable and resilient conversational agents.",

Evaluating these attacks presents a number of challenges, which the current collection of benchmarks and evaluation techniques do not adequately address. First, there is no clear standard of practice regarding jailbreaking evaluation. Second, existing works compute costs and success rates in incomparable ways. And third, numerous works are not reproducible, as they withhold adversarial prompts, involve closed-source code, or rely on evolving proprietary APIs. To address these challenges, we introduce JailbreakBench, an open-sourced benchmark with the following components: (1) an evolving repository of state-of-the-art adversarial prompts, which we refer to as jailbreak artifacts; (2) a jailbreaking dataset comprising 100 behaviors -- both original and sourced from prior work -- which align with OpenAI's usage policies; (3) a standardized evaluation framework that includes a clearly defined threat model, system prompts, chat templates, and scoring functions; and (4) a leaderboard that tracks the performance of attacks and defenses for various LLMs. We have carefully considered the potential ethical implications of releasing this benchmark, and believe that it will be a net positive for the community. Over time, we will expand and adapt the benchmark to reflect technical and methodological advances in the research community.",

In this paper, we propose a novel prompt-based adversarial attack to compromise NLP models and robustness enhancement technique. We first construct malicious prompts for each instance and generate adversarial examples via mask-and-filling under the effect of a malicious purpose. Our attack technique targets the inherent vulnerabilities of NLP models, allowing us to generate samples even without interacting with the victim NLP model, as long as it is based on pre-trained language models (PLMs). Furthermore, we design a prompt-based adversarial training method to improve the robustness of PLMs. As our training method does not actually generate adversarial samples, it can be applied to large-scale training sets efficiently. The experimental results show that our attack method can achieve a high attack success rate with more diverse, fluent and natural adversarial examples. In addition, our robustness enhancement method can significantly improve the robustness of models to resist adversarial attacks.

            "abstract": "Because\"out-of-the-box\"large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called\"jailbreaks\"against LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others.

SmoothLLM reduces the attack success rate on numerous popular LLMs to below one percentage point, avoids unnecessary conservatism, and admits provable guarantees on attack mitigation. Moreover, our defense uses exponentially fewer queries than existing attacks and is compatible with any LLM.

While some defenses have been proposed, they focus on narrow threat models and fall short of a strong defense, which we posit should be effective, universal, and practical. To achieve this, we propose the first adversarial objective for defending LMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, robust prompt optimization (RPO), that uses gradient-based token optimization to enforce harmless outputs. This results in an easily accessible suffix that significantly improves robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown, held-out jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate on Starling-7B from 84% to 8.66% across 20 jailbreaks. In addition, we find that RPO has a minor effect on benign use, is successful under adaptive attacks, and can transfer to black-box models, reducing the success rate of the strongest attack on GPT-4, GUARD, from 92% to 6%.",

To fill the research gap, we carry out the following work: 1) We discover a system prompt leakage vulnerability in GPT-4V. Through carefully designed dialogue, we successfully extract the internal system prompts of GPT-4V. This finding indicates potential exploitable security risks in MLLMs; 2) Based on the acquired system prompts, we propose a novel MLLM jailbreaking attack method termed SASP (Self-Adversarial Attack via System Prompt). By employing GPT-4 as a red teaming tool against itself, we aim to search for potential jailbreak prompts leveraging stolen system prompts. Furthermore, in pursuit of better performance, we also add human modification based on GPT-4's analysis, which further improves the attack success rate to 98.7\\%; 3) We evaluated the effect of modifying system prompts to defend against jailbreaking attacks. Results show that appropriately designed system prompts can significantly reduce jailbreak success rates. Overall, our work provides new insights into enhancing MLLM security, demonstrating the important role of system prompts in jailbreaking.

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are designed to provide useful and safe responses. However, adversarial prompts known as 'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate potentially harmful content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require optimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization or efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we propose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to generate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we analyze the failure of LLMs defense from the perspective of prompt execution priority, and propose corresponding defense strategies. We hope that our research can catalyze both the academic community and LLMs developers towards the provision of safer and more regulated LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ReNeLLM.",

For robust safety evaluation, we apply these methods in the critical domain of AI safety to algorithmically generate a test suite of prompts covering diverse robustness settings -- semantic equivalence, related scenarios, and adversarial. We partition our prompts into four safety domains for a fine-grained analysis of how the domain affects model performance.

            "abstract": "In recent years, NLP practitioners have converged on the following practice: (i) import an off-the-shelf pretrained (masked) language model; (ii) append a multilayer perceptron atop the CLS token's hidden representation (with randomly initialized weights); and (iii) fine-tune the entire model on a downstream task (MLP-FT). This procedure has produced massive gains on standard NLP benchmarks, but these models remain brittle, even to mild adversarial perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate surprising gains in adversarial robustness enjoyed by Model-tuning Via Prompts (MVP), an alternative method of adapting to downstream tasks. Rather than appending an MLP head to make output prediction, MVP appends a prompt template to the input, and makes prediction via text infilling/completion. Across 5 NLP datasets, 4 adversarial attacks, and 3 different models, MVP improves performance against adversarial substitutions by an average of 8% over standard methods and even outperforms adversarial training-based state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By combining MVP with adversarial training, we achieve further improvements in adversarial robustness while maintaining performance on unperturbed examples. Finally, we conduct ablations to investigate the mechanism underlying these gains. Notably, we find that the main causes of vulnerability of MLP-FT can be attributed to the misalignment between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, and the randomly initialized MLP parameters.",

First, we underscore that the continuous and high-dimensional nature of the visual input makes it a weak link against adversarial attacks, representing an expanded attack surface of vision-integrated LLMs. Second, we highlight that the versatility of LLMs also presents visual attackers with a wider array of achievable adversarial objectives, extending the implications of security failures beyond mere misclassification. As an illustration, we present a case study in which we exploit visual adversarial examples to circumvent the safety guardrail of aligned LLMs with integrated vision. Intriguingly, we discover that a single visual adversarial example can universally jailbreak an aligned LLM, compelling it to heed a wide range of harmful instructions (that it otherwise would not) and generate harmful content that transcends the narrow scope of a `few-shot' derogatory corpus initially employed to optimize the adversarial example. Our study underscores the escalating adversarial risks associated with the pursuit of multimodality.

            "abstract": "Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Specifically, the well-designed prompt texts are constructed for input texts and the substitute words are obtained by mask-and-filling procedure under the effect of prompt texts, so the text fluency and semantic similarity can be enhanced. Additionally, the word modification priority is adaptively determined by employing the variable neighborhood search algorithm, yielding an improvement in the attack success ratio.

            "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external content has enabled more up-to-date and wide-ranging applications of LLMs, such as Microsoft Copilot. However, this integration has also exposed LLMs to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where an attacker can embed malicious instructions within external content, compromising LLM output and causing responses to deviate from user expectations. To investigate this important but underexplored issue, we introduce the first benchmark for indirect prompt injection attacks, named BIPIA, to evaluate the risk of such attacks. Based on the evaluation, our work makes a key analysis of the underlying reason for the success of the attack, namely the inability of LLMs to distinguish between instructions and external content and the absence of LLMs' awareness to not execute instructions within external content. Building upon this analysis, we develop two black-box methods based on prompt learning and a white-box defense method based on fine-tuning with adversarial training accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that black-box defenses are highly effective in mitigating these attacks, while the white-box defense reduces the attack success rate to near-zero levels. Overall, our work systematically investigates indirect prompt injection attacks by introducing a benchmark, analyzing the underlying reason for the success of the attack, and developing an initial set of defenses.",

Therefore, it is crucial to discover and modify potential toxic outputs of pre-trained language models before deployment. In this work, we elicit toxic content by automatically searching for a prompt that directs pre-trained language models towards the generation of a specific target output. The problem is challenging due to the discrete nature of textual data and the considerable computational resources required for a single forward pass of the language model. To combat these challenges, we introduce Auto-regressive Selective Replacement Ascent (ASRA), a discrete optimization algorithm that selects prompts based on both quality and similarity with determinantal point process (DPP). Experimental results on six different pre-trained language models demonstrate the efficacy of ASRA for eliciting toxic content. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the success rate of ASRA attacks and the perplexity of target outputs, while indicating limited association with the quantity of model parameters.",

Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision? We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.",

We find that the manipulation efficiency depends on the target text's length and perplexity, with the Babel prompts often located in lower loss minima compared to natural prompts.

Nonetheless, multimodal generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable modality (e.g., vision). To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of open-source large VLMs in the most realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning the targeted responses. In particular, we first craft targeted adversarial examples against pretrained models such as CLIP and BLIP, and then transfer these adversarial examples to other VLMs such as MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, UniDiffuser, BLIP-2, and Img2Prompt. In addition, we observe that black-box queries on these VLMs can further improve the effectiveness of targeted evasion, resulting in a surprisingly high success rate for generating targeted responses. Our findings provide a quantitative understanding regarding the adversarial vulnerability of large VLMs and call for a more thorough examination of their potential security flaws before deployment in practice.

While incorporating demonstrations can greatly enhance the performance of LLMs across various tasks, it may introduce a new security concern: attackers can manipulate only the demonstrations without changing the input to perform an attack. In this paper, we investigate the security concern of ICL from an adversarial perspective, focusing on the impact of demonstrations. We propose a novel attack method named advICL, which aims to manipulate only the demonstration without changing the input to mislead the models. Our results demonstrate that as the number of demonstrations increases, the robustness of in-context learning would decrease. Additionally, we also identify the intrinsic property of the demonstrations is that they can be used (prepended) with different inputs. As a result, it introduces a more practical threat model in which an attacker can attack the test input example even without knowing and manipulating it. To achieve it, we propose the transferable version of advICL, named Transferable-advICL. Our experiment shows that the adversarial demonstration generated by Transferable-advICL can successfully attack the unseen test input examples. We hope that our study reveals the critical security risks associated with ICL and underscores the need for extensive research on the robustness of ICL, particularly given its increasing significance in the advancement of LLMs.",

While much of the prior FSL methods focus on improving downstream task performance, there is a limited understanding of the adversarial robustness of such methods. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of several state-of-the-art FSL methods to assess their robustness to adversarial perturbations. To better understand the impact of various factors towards robustness (or the lack of it), we evaluate prompt-based FSL methods against fully fine-tuned models for aspects such as the use of unlabeled data, multiple prompts, number of few-shot examples, model size and type. Our results on six GLUE tasks indicate that compared to fully fine-tuned models, vanilla FSL methods lead to a notable relative drop in task performance (i.e., are less robust) in the face of adversarial perturbations. However, using (i) unlabeled data for prompt-based FSL and (ii) multiple prompts flip the trend. We further demonstrate that increasing the number of few-shot examples and model size lead to increased adversarial robustness of vanilla FSL methods. Broadly, our work sheds light on the adversarial robustness evaluation of prompt-based FSL methods for NLU tasks.",

Our evaluation of 10 open-source MLLMs reveals a notably high Attack Success Rate (ASR) for attacks transferred from LLMs, highlighting a critical vulnerability in MLLMs that stems from their text-processing capabilities.

Such attacks can result in erroneous outputs, model-generated hate speech, and the exposure of users' sensitive information. While existing research has focused on adversarial attacks during either the training or the fine-tuning of PLMs, there is a deficit of information on attacks made between these two development phases.

Specifically, we develop cross-modality attacks on alignment where we pair adversarial images going through the vision encoder with textual prompts to break the alignment of the language model. Our attacks employ a novel compositional strategy that combines an image, adversarially targeted towards toxic embeddings, with generic prompts to accomplish the jailbreak. Thus, the LLM draws the context to answer the generic prompt from the adversarial image. The generation of benign-appearing adversarial images leverages a novel embedding-space-based methodology, operating with no access to the LLM model. Instead, the attacks require access only to the vision encoder and utilize one of our four embedding space targeting strategies. By not requiring access to the LLM, the attacks lower the entry barrier for attackers, particularly when vision encoders such as CLIP are embedded in closed-source LLMs. The attacks achieve a high success rate across different VLMs, highlighting the risk of cross-modality alignment vulnerabilities, and the need for new alignment approaches for multi-modal models.",

Recent advances in language models trained on code have shown superior performance in generating these representations compared to language models trained solely on natural language text. The existing fine-tuned neural semantic parsers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on natural-language inputs. While it has been established that the robustness of smaller semantic parsers can be enhanced through adversarial training, this approach is not feasible for large language models in real-world scenarios, as it requires both substantial computational resources and expensive human annotation on in-domain semantic parsing data. This paper presents the first empirical study on the adversarial robustness of a prompt-based semantic parser based on CODEX, a stateof-the-art (SOTA) language model trained on code. Our results demonstrate that the large language model of code is vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial examples.

Also, we present the adversarial prompt engineering examples intended to evade the detection by spam filters by means of rewriting the given email while circumventing common spam characteristics. We experimentally evaluate the practical feasibility of prompt engineering on ChatGPT by assessing the performance of six common ML-based spam filters with emails modified by ChatG PT. From the experimental results, we show that adversarial prompt engineering decreases the performance of common ML-based spam filters, while NLP-based filter is robust to such modification.

We first show that the effectiveness of both adversarial attack and defense are sensitive to the used text prompt. Inspired by this, we propose a method to improve resilience to adversarial attacks by learning a robust text prompt for VLMs. The proposed method, named Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered prompts and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution shift and across datasets. Surprisingly, by simply adding one learned word to the prompts, APT can significantly boost the accuracy and robustness (epsilon=4/255) over the hand-engineered prompts by +13% and +8.5% on average respectively. The improvement further increases, in our most effective setting, to +26.4% for accuracy and +16.7% for robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/APT.",

However, there are few studies to examine the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. Instead of attacking prompts in the use of LLMs, we propose a MathAttack model to attack MWP samples which are closer to the essence of robustness in solving math problems. Compared to traditional text adversarial attack, it is essential to preserve the mathematical logic of original MWPs during the attacking. To this end, we propose logical entity recognition to identify logical entries which are then frozen. Subsequently, the remaining text are attacked by adopting a word-level attacker. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset RobustMath to evaluate the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. Extensive experiments on our RobustMath and two another math benchmark datasets GSM8K and MultiAirth show that MathAttack could effectively attack the math solving ability of LLMs. In the experiments, we observe that (1) Our adversarial samples from higher-accuracy LLMs are also effective for attacking LLMs with lower accuracy (e.g., transfer from larger to smaller-size LLMs, or from few-shot to zero-shot prompts); (2) Complex MWPs (such as more solving steps, longer text, more numbers) are more vulnerable to attack; (3) We can improve the robustness of LLMs by using our adversarial samples in few-shot prompts. Finally, we hope our practice and observation can serve as an important attempt towards enhancing the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability.

By summarizing and analyzing existing research, we identified two factors that can influence the efficacy of transfer attacks on VLP models: inter-modal interaction and data diversity. Based on these insights, we propose a self-augment-based transfer attack method, termed SA-Attack. Specifically, during the generation of adversarial images and adversarial texts, we apply different data augmentation methods to the image modality and text modality, respectively, with the aim of improving the adversarial transferability of the generated adversarial images and texts. Experiments conducted on the FLickr30K and COCO datasets have validated the effectiveness of our method. Our code will be available after this paper is accepted.",

            "abstract": "Text summarization (TS) plays a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) by automatically condensing and capturing key information from text documents. Its significance extends to diverse fields, including engineering, healthcare, and others, where it offers substantial time and resource savings. However, manual summarization is a laborious task, prompting the need for automated text summarization systems. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for extractive summarization that leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) word embedding. BERT, a transformer-based architecture, processes sentence bidirectionally, considering both preceding and following words. This contextual understanding empowers BERT to generate word representations that carry a deeper meaning and accurately reflect their usage within specific contexts. Our method adopts a generator and discriminator within the GAN framework. The generator assesses the likelihood of each sentence in the summary while the discriminator evaluates the generated summary. To extract meaningful features in parallel, we introduce three dilated convolution layers in the generator and discriminator. Dilated convolution allows for capturing a larger context and incorporating long-range dependencies. By introducing gaps between filter weights, dilated convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to consider a broader context of words. To encourage the generator to explore diverse sentence combinations that lead to high-quality summaries, we introduce various noises to each document within our proposed GAN. This approach allows the generator to learn from a range of sentence permutations and select the most suitable ones. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The results, measured using the ROUGE metric, demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to other tested methods. This confirms the effectiveness of our GAN-based strategy, which integrates dilated convolution layers, BERT word embedding, and a generator-discriminator framework in achieving enhanced extractive summarization performance.",

However, while CLIP-based zero-shot classifiers have demonstrated competitive performance across a range of domain shifts, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Therefore, ensuring the robustness of such models is crucial for their reliable deployment in the wild. In this work, we introduce Open Vocabulary Certification (OVC), a fast certification method designed for open-vocabulary models like CLIP via randomized smoothing techniques. Given a base\"training\"set of prompts and their corresponding certified CLIP classifiers, OVC relies on the observation that a classifier with a novel prompt can be viewed as a perturbed version of nearby classifiers in the base training set. Therefore, OVC can rapidly certify the novel classifier using a variation of incremental randomized smoothing. By using a caching trick, we achieve approximately two orders of magnitude acceleration in the certification process for novel prompts. To achieve further (heuristic) speedups, OVC approximates the embedding space at a given input using a multivariate normal distribution bypassing the need for sampling via forward passes through the vision backbone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OVC on through experimental evaluation using multiple vision-language backbones on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet test datasets.",

In this paper, we formalize diversity of representation in generative LLMs. We present evaluation datasets and propose metrics to measure diversity in generated responses along people and culture axes.

Along this direction, one representative strategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the feedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such reflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem: once the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to generate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is incorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of\"tit for tat\"and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final solution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs which would be helpful for tasks that require deep levels of contemplation. Experiment results on two challenging datasets, commonsense machine translation and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our MAD framework. Extensive analyses suggest that the adaptive break of debate and the modest level of\"tit for tat\"state are required for MAD to obtain good performance.

            "abstract": "Automatic determination of an areal vehicle's strategy rests on accurate simulation and forecasting to inform control decisions. As system dynamics affect the outcomes, when two or more vehicles interact finding the best strategy to take may be considered a differential game. While traditionally modelled using ideal kinematics, the effect on, and the variation of, the optimal strategy based on simulating realistic dynamics is investigated. A derivation for the optimal strategies of the players in \u2018regular\u2019 regions of the state space is completed. Two simulators were developed to compare game terminal results to the theoretical predictions. A MATLAB simulator with ideal player kinematics was the first simulator formed. Then, a high-fidelity simulator, using Microsoft's AirSim project was implemented. This involved configuring AirSim to run using software commands only, and extending the functionality to allow for the simulation of two separately-controlled drones. A trivial differential game with two agile players, termed Pedestrian Tag (PT), was used to identify the accuracy of time-to-capture predictions. The MATLAB simulator was found to match the model prediction, whereas the AirSim simulator required more gameplay time than predicted to achieve capture. For a Homicidal Chauffeur (HC) game, the MATLAB simulator results were consistent with the theoretical predictions. However, multiple outcomes of trials contrasted the predicted terminal results for the high-fidelity simulator. The results indicate that modelling the players to have ideal kinematics does not correctly predict the outcome of a pursuit-evasion game with full/realistic dynamics. Although some deviation from the model assumptions was introduced due to implementation constraints, the primary factor was concluded to be the realistic velocities of the drone agents due to unaccounted dynamics such as inertia and drag. Future research topics prompted by this work include applying the simulation to more differential games, and comparing against player strategies developed from other methods.",

            "abstract": ": Theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to impute unobservable mental states to others, is central to human social interactions, communication, empathy, self-consciousness, and morality. We administer classic false-belief tasks, widely used to test ToM in humans, to several language models, without any examples or pre-training. Our results show that models published before 2022 show virtually no ability to solve ToM tasks. Yet, the January 2022 version of GPT-3 (davinci-002) solved 70% of ToM tasks, a performance comparable with that of seven-year-old children. Moreover, its November 2022 version (davinci-003), solved 93% of ToM tasks, a performance comparable with that of nine-year-old children. These findings suggest that ToM-like ability (thus far considered to be uniquely human) may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of language models\u2019 improving language skills.",

            "abstract": "The escalating debate on AI\u2019s capabilities warrants developing reliable metrics to assess machine \u201cintelligence.\u201d Recently, many anecdotal examples were used to suggest that newer Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM); however, prior work reached conflicting conclusions regarding those abilities. We investigate the extent of LLMs\u2019 N-ToM through an extensive evaluation of 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities, this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples, indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities. We caution against drawing conclusions from anecdotal examples, limited benchmark testing, and using human-designed psychological tests to evaluate models.",

            "abstract": "The Eskom electricity transmission grid controllers at the National Control Centre (NCC) in Germiston, South Africa, rely on their expertise, developed over years, in order to carry out their work. This expertise includes many skills rooted in subconscious processing and interactions. These tacit strategies and mental content have evolved in relation to the network data, presented to them by means of computer displays and other means (telephone, personal contact, etc.). This data is then converted to information about the network in their minds. The information is then processed subconsciously and consciously, so that the sophisticated interpretation algorithms, which have evolved in their minds, can identify the state of affairs in the network and prompt them to action. Two years ago (2008) a new computer interface was introduced at the NCC, which is Windows based, this new format is referred to as the TEMSE system. Data is now presented in a different format, with a slightly different appearance, and different configuration. This work aims to contribute to the body of knowledge pertaining to human controller performance factors, by identifying the impact of the implementation of the new displays on the tacit or subconscious mental processing of both expert and novice controllers. Simulator tasks and interviews were designed to elicit the tacit activity in the controllers\u2019 minds in response to the new TEMSE interface. A variation of Retrospective Verbal Protocol analysis was used during the interviews in order to elicit the tacit dimensions investigated, adapted for this purpose (by including Sub-modality Elicitation techniques, and Metamodel type questions from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)), referred to as the Tacit Retrospective Verbal Protocol analysis (TRVP). The findings show that the controllers\u2019 minds are influenced at various levels by the interface changeover. Extensive evidence of the presence of tacit imagery, auditory, and other complex emotive components within each controller is presented, which hitherto had remained unnoticed. Making these influences explicit can be the first step in structuring appropriate training and other interventions, in order to improve overall controller performance. An extensive list of recommendations proposes interventions to improve controller performance as well as computer interface design. Eskom network controllers are real experts in their work, with many years of naturalistic decision-making experience. Access to such subjects provided a true source of embedded tacit expertise.",
