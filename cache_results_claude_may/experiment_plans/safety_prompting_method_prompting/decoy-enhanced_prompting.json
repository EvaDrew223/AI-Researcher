        "Problem": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulated by malicious users to generate harmful, biased, or deceptive content. This is often achieved through carefully crafted adversarial prompts that exploit the model's weaknesses and steer it towards undesired outputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing defense strategies against adversarial prompts include adversarial training, prompt filtering, and using separate models for content moderation. However, these approaches often require significant resources and can still be circumvented by sophisticated attackers.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a novel prompting strategy that enhances the robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks by introducing decoy prompts. By training the model to distinguish between genuine and decoy prompts, we aim to make it more resilient to manipulation attempts and improve its ability to generate safe and truthful content.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Decoy-Enhanced Prompting (DEP), a training strategy that augments the standard prompting process with adversarially generated decoy prompts. The key steps are as follows: 1) Decoy Generation: For each genuine prompt in the training set, we generate a set of decoy prompts that are semantically similar but contain adversarial triggers or manipulations. 2) Decoy Labeling: We label the genuine and decoy prompts accordingly, creating a binary classification task. 3) Adversarial Training: We fine-tune the LLM on the augmented dataset, training it to distinguish between genuine and decoy prompts. 4) Inference: At inference time, we use the fine-tuned model to classify incoming prompts as either genuine or potentially adversarial. Prompts classified as adversarial are flagged for further review or rejected. By exposing the model to adversarial prompts during training, DEP helps the LLM learn to recognize and defend against manipulation attempts, improving its robustness in real-world settings.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate DEP on a range of adversarial prompting benchmarks, measuring its effectiveness in detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks. We will compare DEP to baseline methods such as standard adversarial training and prompt filtering. We will also assess the model's performance on benign tasks to ensure that the adversarial training does not degrade its overall capabilities. We hypothesize that DEP will significantly improve the model's robustness against adversarial prompts while maintaining high performance on normal inputs."

If the DEP method fails to yield satisfactory results after exploring these alternatives, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of current adversarial defense techniques for LLMs and proposing new research directions based on the insights gained from the experiments."

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced tremendous popularity and are widely used from casual conversations to AI-driven programming. However, despite their considerable success, LLMs are not entirely reliable and can give detailed guidance on how to conduct harmful or illegal activities. While safety measures can reduce the risk of such outputs, adversarial jailbreak attacks can still exploit LLMs to produce harmful content. These jailbreak templates are typically manually crafted, making large-scale testing challenging. In this paper, we introduce GPTFuzz, a novel black-box jailbreak fuzzing framework inspired by the AFL fuzzing framework. Instead of manual engineering, GPTFuzz automates the generation of jailbreak templates for red-teaming LLMs. At its core, GPTFuzz starts with human-written templates as initial seeds, then mutates them to produce new templates. We detail three key components of GPTFuzz: a seed selection strategy for balancing efficiency and variability, mutate operators for creating semantically equivalent or similar sentences, and a judgment model to assess the success of a jailbreak attack. We evaluate GPTFuzz against various commercial and open-source LLMs, including ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Vicuna, under diverse attack scenarios. Our results indicate that GPTFuzz consistently produces jailbreak templates with a high success rate, surpassing human-crafted templates. Remarkably, GPTFuzz achieves over 90% attack success rates against ChatGPT and Llama-2 models, even with suboptimal initial seed templates. We anticipate that GPTFuzz will be instrumental for researchers and practitioners in examining LLM robustness and will encourage further exploration into enhancing LLM safety.",

            "abstract": "The aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful language understanding and decision-making tools that are created through extensive alignment with human feedback. However, these large models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to elicit malicious outputs that should not be given by aligned LLMs. Investigating jailbreak prompts can lead us to delve into the limitations of LLMs and further guide us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak techniques suffer from either (1) scalability issues, where attacks heavily rely on manual crafting of prompts, or (2) stealthiness problems, as attacks depend on token-based algorithms to generate prompts that are often semantically meaningless, making them susceptible to detection through basic perplexity testing. In light of these challenges, we intend to answer this question: Can we develop an approach that can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts? In this paper, we introduce AutoDAN, a novel jailbreak attack against aligned LLMs. AutoDAN can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoDAN not only automates the process while preserving semantic meaningfulness, but also demonstrates superior attack strength in cross-model transferability, and cross-sample universality compared with the baseline. Moreover, we also compare AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass them effectively.",

In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptBench, a robustness benchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This study uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across multiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. The adversarial prompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim to evaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintaining semantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks, such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4788 adversarial prompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts. Furthermore, we present comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability.

In the heart of these systems lies a safety classifier, a computational model trained to discern and mitigate potentially harmful, offensive, or unethical outputs. However, contemporary safety classifiers, despite their potential, often fail when exposed to inputs infused with adversarial noise. In response, our study introduces the Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS), a lightweight model that excels in detection accuracy and demonstrates resilience against adversarial prompts. Additionally, we propose novel strategies for autonomously generating adversarial training datasets, named Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) datasets. These datasets are designed to fortify the safety classifier's robustness, and we investigate the consequences of incorporating adversarial examples into the training process. Through evaluations involving Large Language Models, we demonstrate that our classifier has the potential to decrease the attack success rate resulting from adversarial attacks by up to 60%.

Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision? We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.",

            "abstract": "The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention from the general public and LLM vendors. In response, efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and they have persisted online for over 100 days. Our work sheds light on the severe and evolving threat landscape of jailbreak prompts. We hope our study can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and regulated LLMs.",

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are designed to provide useful and safe responses. However, adversarial prompts known as 'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate potentially harmful content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require optimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization or efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we propose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to generate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we analyze the failure of LLMs defense from the perspective of prompt execution priority, and propose corresponding defense strategies. We hope that our research can catalyze both the academic community and LLMs developers towards the provision of safer and more regulated LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ReNeLLM.",

In this adversarial cycle, the two models seek to outperform each other in the prompting phase, generating a dataset of rich examples which are then used for fine-tuning. This iterative application of prompting and fine-tuning allows continuous refinement and improved performance.

We demonstrate that LLMs' faithfulness can be significantly improved using carefully designed prompting strategies. In particular, we identify opinion-based prompts and counterfactual demonstrations as the most effective methods. Opinion-based prompts reframe the context as a narrator's statement and inquire about the narrator's opinions, while counterfactual demonstrations use instances containing false facts to improve faithfulness in knowledge conflict situations.

First, we underscore that the continuous and high-dimensional nature of the visual input makes it a weak link against adversarial attacks, representing an expanded attack surface of vision-integrated LLMs. Second, we highlight that the versatility of LLMs also presents visual attackers with a wider array of achievable adversarial objectives, extending the implications of security failures beyond mere misclassification. As an illustration, we present a case study in which we exploit visual adversarial examples to circumvent the safety guardrail of aligned LLMs with integrated vision. Intriguingly, we discover that a single visual adversarial example can universally jailbreak an aligned LLM, compelling it to heed a wide range of harmful instructions (that it otherwise would not) and generate harmful content that transcends the narrow scope of a `few-shot' derogatory corpus initially employed to optimize the adversarial example. Our study underscores the escalating adversarial risks associated with the pursuit of multimodality. Our findings also connect the long-studied adversarial vulnerabilities of neural networks to the nascent field of AI alignment. The presented attack suggests a fundamental adversarial challenge for AI alignment, especially in light of the emerging trend toward multimodality in frontier foundation models.",

In this paper, we investigate the security concern of ICL from an adversarial perspective, focusing on the impact of demonstrations. We propose a novel attack method named advICL, which aims to manipulate only the demonstration without changing the input to mislead the models. Our results demonstrate that as the number of demonstrations increases, the robustness of in-context learning would decrease. Additionally, we also identify the intrinsic property of the demonstrations is that they can be used (prepended) with different inputs. As a result, it introduces a more practical threat model in which an attacker can attack the test input example even without knowing and manipulating it. To achieve it, we propose the transferable version of advICL, named Transferable-advICL. Our experiment shows that the adversarial demonstration generated by Transferable-advICL can successfully attack the unseen test input examples.

Specifically, we develop cross-modality attacks on alignment where we pair adversarial images going through the vision encoder with textual prompts to break the alignment of the language model. Our attacks employ a novel compositional strategy that combines an image, adversarially targeted towards toxic embeddings, with generic prompts to accomplish the jailbreak. Thus, the LLM draws the context to answer the generic prompt from the adversarial image. The generation of benign-appearing adversarial images leverages a novel embedding-space-based methodology, operating with no access to the LLM model. Instead, the attacks require access only to the vision encoder and utilize one of our four embedding space targeting strategies. By not requiring access to the LLM, the attacks lower the entry barrier for attackers, particularly when vision encoders such as CLIP are embedded in closed-source LLMs. The attacks achieve a high success rate across different VLMs, highlighting the risk of cross-modality alignment vulnerabilities, and the need for new alignment approaches for multi-modal models.",

However, these models are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that adversarial pre-training can improve both generalization and robustness. We propose a general algorithm ALUM (Adversarial training for large neural LangUage Models), which regularizes the training objective by applying perturbations in the embedding space that maximizes the adversarial loss. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial training in all stages, including pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training on a well-trained model, and task-specific fine-tuning. ALUM obtains substantial gains over BERT on a wide range of NLP tasks, in both regular and adversarial scenarios. Even for models that have been well trained on extremely large text corpora, such as RoBERTa, ALUM can still produce significant gains from continual pre-training, whereas conventional non-adversarial methods can not.

            "abstract": "Different from traditional task-specific vision models, recent large VLMs can readily adapt to different vision tasks by simply using different textual instructions, i.e., prompts. However, a well-known concern about traditional task-specific vision models is that they can be misled by imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the concern is exacerbated by the phenomenon that the same adversarial perturbations can fool different task-specific models. Given that VLMs rely on prompts to adapt to different tasks, an intriguing question emerges: Can a single adversarial image mislead all predictions of VLMs when a thousand different prompts are given? This question essentially introduces a novel perspective on adversarial transferability: cross-prompt adversarial transferability. In this work, we propose the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA). This proposed method updates the visual adversarial perturbation with learnable prompts, which are designed to counteract the misleading effects of the adversarial image. By doing this, CroPA significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples across prompts. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong cross-prompt adversarial transferability of CroPA with prevalent VLMs including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP in various different tasks.

This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research.

The goal of this work is to provide an in depth comparison of different approaches for adversarial training in language models. Specifically, we study the effect of pre-training data augmentation as well as training time input perturbations vs. embedding space perturbations on the robustness and generalization of transformer-based language models. Our findings suggest that better robustness can be achieved by pre-training data augmentation or by training with input space perturbation. However, training with embedding space perturbation significantly improves generalization. A linguistic correlation analysis of neurons of the learned models reveals that the improved generalization is due to 'more specialized' neurons.

Although adversarial training can boost the robustness of machine learning algorithms by a margin, research has not been conducted to determine if adversarial training is effective in the long-term. As deployments of machine learning algorithms are characterized by dynamics, change of the underlying model is inevitable. The dynamics are a result of model's evolution over time by introducing new training data and drifting the model by changing its parameters. In this paper, we examine the limitations of adversarial training due to the temporal changes of machine learning models. Using a natural language task, we conduct various experiments using a variety of datasets to measure the impact of concept drift on the efficacy of adversarial training. In particular, our analysis shows that certain adversarially-trained models are even more prone to the drift than others. In particular, WordCNN and LSTM-based models are shown more susceptible to the temporal changes than others such as BERT.

This paper investigates AT from the perspective of the contextualized language representation outputted by PLM encoders. We find the current AT attacks lean to generate sub-optimal adversarial examples that can fool the decoder part but have a minor effect on the encoder. However, we find it necessary to effectively deviate the latter one to allow AT to gain. Based on the observation, we propose simple yet effective \\textit{Contextualized representation-Adversarial Training} (CreAT), in which the attack is explicitly optimized to deviate the contextualized representation of the encoder. It allows a global optimization of adversarial examples that can fool the entire model. We also find CreAT gives rise to a better direction to optimize the adversarial examples, to let them less sensitive to hyperparameters. Compared to AT, CreAT produces consistent performance gains on a wider range of tasks and is proven to be more effective for language pre-training where only the encoder part is kept for downstream tasks.

            "abstract": "Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), showing potential in traditional tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Our study explores a three-phase training strategy that harnesses GPT-4's capabilities to enhance the BERT model's performance on NER. Initially, GPT-4 annotates a subset of the CONLL2003 and additional BBC dataset without fine-tuning. We then train BERT using a mix of original and LLM-annotated data, analyzing the efficacy of LLM annotations against traditional methods. The second phase involves comparative experiments with different training regimens, assessing the synergy between distilled and original data. We observe that sequential strategies, particularly a simple mix of training first with distilled data followed by original data, significantly boost performance. In the third phase, we investigate various data blending techniques, including sigmoid and power decay functions, to optimize the training process further. Our results indicate that a strategic mix of distilled and original data markedly elevates the NER capabilities of BERT. Our approach presents a scalable methodology that reduces manual annotation costs and increases efficiency, making it especially pertinent in resource-limited and closed-network environments. The study concludes that while the 'Simple Mix' strategy yields the best results, understanding its underlying mechanisms requires further research. Future work will also focus on refining prompt designs and enhancing annotation selection processes, aiming to extend our methodology to diverse NLP tasks.",

In this paper, we conduct an empirical exploration on the effect of each component in cross-lingual prompting and derive language-agnostic Universal Prompting, which helps alleviate the discrepancies between source-language training and target-language inference. Based on this, we propose DPA, a dual prompt augmentation framework, aiming at relieving the data scarcity issue in few-shot cross-lingual prompting.

            "abstract": "Contextualized or discourse aware commonsense inference is the task of generating coherent commonsense assertions (i.e., facts) from a given story, and a particular sentence from that story. Some problems with the task are: lack of controllability for topics of the inferred facts; lack of commonsense knowledge during training; and, possibly, hallucinated or false facts. In this work, we utilize a transformer model for this task and develop techniques to address the aforementioned problems in the task. We control the inference by introducing a new technique we call\"hinting\". Hinting is a kind of language model prompting, that utilizes both hard prompts (specific words) and soft prompts (virtual learnable templates). This serves as a control signal to advise the language model\"what to talk about\". Next, we establish a methodology for performing joint inference with multiple commonsense knowledge bases. Joint inference of commonsense requires care, because it is imprecise and the level of generality is more flexible. You want to be sure that the results\"still make sense\"for the context. To this end, we align the textual version of assertions from three knowledge graphs (ConceptNet, ATOMIC2020, and GLUCOSE) with a story and a target sentence. This combination allows us to train a single model to perform joint inference with multiple knowledge graphs. We show experimental results for the three knowledge graphs on joint inference. Our final contribution is exploring a GAN architecture that generates the contextualized commonsense assertions and scores them as to their plausibility through a discriminator. The result is an integrated system for contextual commonsense inference in stories, that can controllably generate plausible commonsense assertions, and takes advantage of joint inference between multiple commonsense knowledge bases.",

Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets.

The transferability degradation is partly caused by the under-utilization of cross-modal interactions. Particularly, unlike unimodal learning, VLP models rely heavily on cross-modal interactions and the multimodal alignments are many-to-many, e.g., an image can be described in various natural languages. To this end, we propose a highly transferable Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA) that thoroughly leverages modality interactions and incorporates alignment-preserving augmentation with cross-modal guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that SGA could generate adversarial examples that can strongly transfer across different VLP models on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, SGA significantly enhances the attack success rate for transfer attacks from ALBEF to TCL by a large margin (at least 9.78% and up to 30.21%), compared to the state-of-the-art.

            "abstract": "Large language models (large LMs) are increasingly trained on massive codebases and used to generate code. However, LMs lack awareness of security and are found to frequently produce unsafe code. This work studies the security of LMs along two important axes: (i) security hardening, which aims to enhance LMs' reliability in generating secure code, and (ii) adversarial testing, which seeks to evaluate LMs' security at an adversarial standpoint. We address both of these by formulating a new security task called controlled code generation. The task is parametric and takes as input a binary property to guide the LM to generate secure or unsafe code, while preserving the LM's capability of generating functionally correct code. We propose a novel learning-based approach called SVEN to solve this task. SVEN leverages property-specific continuous vectors to guide program generation towards the given property, without modifying the LM's weights. Our training procedure optimizes these continuous vectors by enforcing specialized loss terms on different regions of code, using a high-quality dataset carefully curated by us. Our extensive evaluation shows that SVEN is highly effective in achieving strong security control. For instance, a state-of-the-art CodeGen LM with 2.7B parameters generates secure code for 59.1% of the time. When we employ SVEN to perform security hardening (or adversarial testing) on this LM, the ratio is significantly boosted to 92.3% (or degraded to 36.8%). Importantly, SVEN closely matches the original LMs in functional correctness.",

            "abstract": "Current Visual-Language Pre-training (VLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. These adversarial examples present substantial security risks to VLP models, as they can leverage inherent weaknesses in the models, resulting in incorrect predictions. In contrast to white-box adversarial attacks, transfer attacks (where the adversary crafts adversarial examples on a white-box model to fool another black-box model) are more reflective of real-world scenarios, thus making them more meaningful for research. By summarizing and analyzing existing research, we identified two factors that can influence the efficacy of transfer attacks on VLP models: inter-modal interaction and data diversity. Based on these insights, we propose a self-augment-based transfer attack method, termed SA-Attack. Specifically, during the generation of adversarial images and adversarial texts, we apply different data augmentation methods to the image modality and text modality, respectively, with the aim of improving the adversarial transferability of the generated adversarial images and texts. Experiments conducted on the FLickr30K and COCO datasets have validated the effectiveness of our method. Our code will be available after this paper is accepted.",

However, for solving token-level classification tasks, e.g., named entity recognition (NER), previous research, which utilizes N-gram traversal for prompting all spans with all possible entity types, is time-consuming. To this end, we propose a novel prompt-based contrastive learning method for few-shot NER without template construction and label word mappings. First, we leverage external knowledge to initialize semantic anchors for each entity type. These anchors are simply appended with input sentence embeddings as template-free prompts (TFPs). Then, the prompts and sentence embeddings are in-context optimized with our proposed semantic-enhanced contrastive loss. Our proposed loss function enables contrastive learning in few-shot scenarios without requiring a significant number of negative samples. Moreover, it effectively addresses the issue of conventional contrastive learning, where negative instances with similar semantics are erroneously pushed apart in natural language processing (NLP)-related tasks. We examine our method in label extension (LE), domain-adaption (DA), and low-resource generalization evaluation tasks with six public datasets and different settings, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in most cases.",

            "abstract": "Taxonomies represent hierarchical relations between entities, frequently applied in various software modeling and natural language processing (NLP) activities. They are typically subject to a set of structural constraints restricting their content. However, manual taxonomy construction can be time-consuming, incomplete, and costly to maintain. Recent studies of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that appropriate user inputs (called prompting) can effectively guide LLMs, such as GPT-3, in diverse NLP tasks without explicit (re-)training. However, existing approaches for automated taxonomy construction typically involve fine-tuning a language model by adjusting model parameters. In this paper, we present a general framework for taxonomy construction that takes into account structural constraints. We subsequently conduct a systematic comparison between the prompting and fine-tuning approaches performed on a hypernym taxonomy and a novel computer science taxonomy dataset. Our result reveals the following: (1) Even without explicit training on the dataset, the prompting approach outperforms fine-tuning-based approaches. Moreover, the performance gap between prompting and fine-tuning widens when the training dataset is small. However, (2) taxonomies generated by the fine-tuning approach can be easily post-processed to satisfy all the constraints, whereas handling violations of the taxonomies produced by the prompting approach can be challenging. These evaluation findings provide guidance on selecting the appropriate method for taxonomy construction and highlight potential enhancements for both approaches.",

Different from prior work, our attacks can affect the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to the LLM while being stealthy and generalizable to multiple input prompts. We construct these attacks using gradient-based adversarial training and characterize performance along multiple dimensions. We find that our adversarial images can manipulate the LLM to invoke tools following real-world syntax almost always (~98%) while maintaining high similarity to clean images (~0.9 SSIM). Furthermore, using human scoring and automated metrics, we find that the attacks do not noticeably affect the conversation (and its semantics) between the user and the LLM.",

The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics.

This work presents a novel training paradigm that permits LMs to learn from simulated social interactions.

            "abstract": "Recommender systems utilizing explicit feedback have witnessed significant advancements and widespread applications over the past years. However, generating recommendations in few-shot scenarios remains a persistent challenge. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for addressing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, thereby offering novel insights into tackling the few-shot scenarios encountered by explicit feedback-based recommender systems. To bridge recommender systems and LLMs, we devise a prompting template that generates user and item representations based on explicit feedback. Subsequently, we integrate these LLM-processed representations into various recommendation models to evaluate their significance across diverse recommendation tasks. Our ablation experiments and case study analysis collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs in processing explicit feedback, highlighting that LLMs equipped with generative and logical reasoning capabilities can effectively serve as a component of recommender systems to enhance their performance in few-shot scenarios. Furthermore, the broad adaptability of LLMs augments the generalization potential of recommender models, despite certain inherent constraints. We anticipate that our study can inspire researchers to delve deeper into the multifaceted dimensions of LLMs\u2019 involvement in recommender systems and contribute to the advancement of the explicit feedback-based recommender systems field.",

We investigate features representing individual, sub-domain, and domain knowledge to predict individual jargon familiarity.

            "abstract": "The creation of news timeline is essential for a comprehensive and contextual understanding of events as they unfold over time. This approach aids in discerning patterns and trends that might be obscured when news is viewed in isolation. By organizing news in a chronological sequence, it becomes easier to track the development of stories, understand the interrelation of events, and grasp the broader implications of news items. This is particularly helpful in sectors like finance and insurance, where timely understanding of the event development-ranging from extreme weather to political upheavals and health crises-is indispensable for effective risk management. While traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques have had some success, they often fail to capture the news with nuanced relevance that are readily apparent to domain experts, hindering broader industry integration. The advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a renewed opportunity to tackle this challenge. However, direct prompting LLMs for this task is often ineffective. Our study investigates the application of an extended task prompting technique to assess past news relevance. We demonstrate that enhancing conventional prompts with additional tasks boosts their effectiveness on various news dataset, rendering news timeline generation practical for professional use.

            "abstract": "Image processing is a fundamental task in computer vision, which aims at enhancing image quality and extracting essential features for subsequent vision applications. Traditionally, task-specific models are developed for individual tasks and designing such models requires distinct expertise. Building upon the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP), there is a similar trend in computer vision, which focuses on developing large-scale models through pretraining and in-context learning. This paradigm shift reduces the reliance on task-specific models, yielding a powerful unified model to deal with various tasks. However, these advances have predominantly concentrated on high-level vision tasks, with less attention paid to low-level vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a universal model for general image processing that covers image restoration, image enhancement, image feature extraction tasks, etc. Our proposed framework, named PromptGIP, unifies these diverse image processing tasks within a universal framework. Inspired by NLP question answering (QA) techniques, we employ a visual prompting question answering paradigm. Specifically, we treat the input-output image pair as a structured question-answer sentence, thereby reprogramming the image processing task as a prompting QA problem. PromptGIP can undertake diverse cross-domain tasks using provided visual prompts, eliminating the need for task-specific finetuning. Our methodology offers a universal and adaptive solution to general image processing. While PromptGIP has demonstrated a certain degree of out-of-domain task generalization capability, further research is expected to fully explore its more powerful emergent generalization.",

KDD 23) The paper introduces a novel approach to bridging the gap between pre-trained graph models and the diverse tasks they're applied to, inspired by the success of prompt learning in NLP. Recognizing the challenge of aligning pre-trained models with varied graph tasks (node level, edge level, and graph level), which can lead to negative transfer and poor performance, we propose a multi-task prompting method for graphs. This method involves unifying graph and language prompt formats, enabling NLP's prompting strategies to be adapted for graph tasks. By analyzing the task space of graph applications, we reformulate problems to fit graph-level tasks and apply meta-learning to improve prompt initialization for multiple tasks. Experiments show our method's effectiveness in enhancing model performance across different graph tasks. Beyond the original work, in this extended abstract, we further discuss the graph prompt from a bigger picture and provide some of the latest work toward this area.",

However, the direct adaptation of continuous speech to LLMs that process discrete tokens remains an unsolved challenge, hindering the application of LLMs for speech generation. The advanced speech LMs are in the corner, as that speech signals encapsulate a wealth of information, including speaker and emotion, beyond textual data alone. Prompt tuning has demonstrated notable gains in parameter efficiency and competitive performance on some speech classification tasks. However, the extent to which prompts can effectively elicit generation tasks from speech LMs remains an open question. In this paper, we present pioneering research that explores the application of prompt tuning to stimulate speech LMs for various generation tasks, within a unified framework called SpeechGen, with around 10M trainable parameters. The proposed unified framework holds great promise for efficiency and effectiveness, particularly with the imminent arrival of advanced speech LMs, which will significantly enhance the capabilities of the framework.

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent zero-shot generalization to new language tasks. However, effective utilization of LLMs for zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) remains challenging, primarily due to the modality disconnect and task disconnect between the LLM and VQA tasks. End-to-end training on multimodal data may bridge the disconnects, but is inflexible and computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose Img2LLM, a plug-and-play module that provides LLM prompts to enable LLMs to perform zeroshot VQA tasks without end-to-end training. We develop LLM-agnostic models describe image content as exemplar question-answer pairs, which prove to be effective LLM prompts. Img2LLM offers the following benefits: 1) It achieves comparable or better performance than methods relying on end-to-end training. For example, we outperform Flamingo [3] by 5.6% on VQAv2. On the challenging A-OKVQA dataset, our method outperforms few-shot methods by as much as 20%. 2) It flexibly interfaces with a wide range of LLMs to perform VQA. 3) It eliminates the need to specialize LLMs using end-to-end finetuning and serve highly specialized LLMs to end users, thereby reducing cost.

StyleTTS 2 differs from its predecessor by modeling styles as a latent random variable through diffusion models to generate the most suitable style for the text without requiring reference speech, achieving efficient latent diffusion while benefiting from the diverse speech synthesis offered by diffusion models. Furthermore, we employ large pre-trained SLMs, such as WavLM, as discriminators with our novel differentiable duration modeling for end-to-end training, resulting in improved speech naturalness. StyleTTS 2 surpasses human recordings on the single-speaker LJSpeech dataset and matches it on the multispeaker VCTK dataset as judged by native English speakers. Moreover, when trained on the LibriTTS dataset, our model outperforms previous publicly available models for zero-shot speaker adaptation. This work achieves the first human-level TTS on both single and multispeaker datasets, showcasing the potential of style diffusion and adversarial training with large SLMs. The audio demos and source code are available at https://styletts2.github.io/.",

            "abstract": "Text summarization (TS) plays a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) by automatically condensing and capturing key information from text documents. Its significance extends to diverse fields, including engineering, healthcare, and others, where it offers substantial time and resource savings. However, manual summarization is a laborious task, prompting the need for automated text summarization systems. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for extractive summarization that leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) word embedding. BERT, a transformer-based architecture, processes sentence bidirectionally, considering both preceding and following words. This contextual understanding empowers BERT to generate word representations that carry a deeper meaning and accurately reflect their usage within specific contexts. Our method adopts a generator and discriminator within the GAN framework. The generator assesses the likelihood of each sentence in the summary while the discriminator evaluates the generated summary. To extract meaningful features in parallel, we introduce three dilated convolution layers in the generator and discriminator. Dilated convolution allows for capturing a larger context and incorporating long-range dependencies. By introducing gaps between filter weights, dilated convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to consider a broader context of words. To encourage the generator to explore diverse sentence combinations that lead to high-quality summaries, we introduce various noises to each document within our proposed GAN. This approach allows the generator to learn from a range of sentence permutations and select the most suitable ones. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The results, measured using the ROUGE metric, demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to other tested methods. This confirms the effectiveness of our GAN-based strategy, which integrates dilated convolution layers, BERT word embedding, and a generator-discriminator framework in achieving enhanced extractive summarization performance.",
