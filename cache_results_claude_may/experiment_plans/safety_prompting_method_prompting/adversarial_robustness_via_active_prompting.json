    "idea_name": "Adversarial Robustness via Active Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current adversarial defenses for language models often rely on passive strategies, such as data augmentation or model ensembling, which may not effectively target the most critical vulnerabilities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving language models' adversarial robustness, such as adversarial training and randomized smoothing, can be computationally expensive and may not adapt well to evolving attack patterns.",
        "Motivation": "Active learning has been shown to improve the sample efficiency and adaptivity of machine learning models by strategically selecting the most informative examples for training. We hypothesize that actively selecting the most critical prompts for robustness evaluation and enhancement can also improve the efficiency and effectiveness of adversarial defenses for language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an active prompting framework called ARAP (Adversarial Robustness via Active Prompting) to iteratively improve the adversarial robustness of language models. In each iteration, ARAP first prompts the language model to generate a diverse set of potential adversarial prompts that could expose its vulnerabilities. Then, ARAP evaluates the generated prompts using an ensemble of adversarial attack and defense methods, and selects the most critical prompts that reveal new vulnerabilities or challenge existing defenses. Finally, ARAP prompts the language model to analyze the selected prompts and generate robust responses, which are used to fine-tune the model for enhanced robustness. By actively selecting and learning from the most informative prompts, ARAP enables the language model to efficiently adapt to new attack patterns and improve its worst-case robustness.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ARAP on a range of adversarial attack benchmarks and compare it with state-of-the-art passive defense methods. We will measure the sample efficiency and adaptivity of ARAP by analyzing the number of iterations and prompts needed to achieve a certain level of robustness, and the model's performance on new attack patterns not seen during training. We will also study the effect of different prompt generation, selection, and fine-tuning strategies on the robustness and generalization of the model."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will use a range of adversarial attack benchmarks, such as ANLI, Adversarial GLUE, and Dynabench. These datasets cover different adversarial attack types, such as word substitution, paraphrasing, and logical reasoning. We will use accuracy and robustness (e.g., accuracy on adversarial examples) as the evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 2: Implement Baselines": "We will implement several state-of-the-art passive defense methods as baselines: (1) Adversarial training: fine-tune the language model on a mix of clean and adversarial examples; (2) Randomized smoothing: make random perturbations to the input during inference to smooth out adversarial noise; (3) Ensemble adversarial training: train an ensemble of models with different random initializations and adversarial examples.",
            "Step 3: Implement ARAP": "We will implement the three key components of ARAP: (1) Adversarial prompt generation: use few-shot prompting to guide the language model to generate potential adversarial prompts. The prompt can be like 'Generate a prompt that might cause the model to produce an incorrect or inconsistent response.'; (2) Prompt evaluation and selection: evaluate the generated prompts using an ensemble of attack and defense methods (e.g., TextFooler attack, BERT-Defense), and select the most critical prompts based on the drop in accuracy or robustness score; (3) Robust prompt learning: prompt the language model to analyze the selected prompts and generate robust responses. The prompt can be like 'Analyze why the model might fail on this prompt and generate a response that addresses the potential vulnerabilities.'",
            "Step 4: Fine-tune with ARAP": "We will fine-tune the language model using the selected prompts and robust responses generated by ARAP. We will experiment with different fine-tuning strategies, such as mixing the ARAP prompts with the original training data, or using the ARAP prompts for few-shot learning.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate and Analyze": "We will evaluate the fine-tuned models on the adversarial attack benchmarks and compare their performance with the baselines. We will analyze the effectiveness of ARAP in terms of the number of iterations and prompts needed to achieve a certain level of robustness, and the model's adaptivity to new attack patterns. We will also study the quality and diversity of the generated adversarial prompts and robust responses to gain insights into the strengths and limitations of ARAP."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Adversarial Training)": "Premise: The man on the bench is wearing a black jacket and blue jeans. He has a red beard and is reading a book. Hypothesis: The man is not wearing a black jacket.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Adversarial Training)": "Contradiction",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ARAP; Step 1: Adversarial Prompt Generation)": "Generate a prompt that might cause the model to produce an incorrect or inconsistent response, based on the following example: Premise: The man on the bench is wearing a black jacket and blue jeans. He has a red beard and is reading a book. Hypothesis: The man is not wearing a black jacket. Label: Contradiction",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ARAP; Step 1: Adversarial Prompt Generation)": "Premise: The tall man on the wooden bench is wearing a dark black jacket and blue denim jeans. He has a long red beard and is reading a hardcover book. Hypothesis: The man on the bench is not wearing jeans.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ARAP; Step 2: Prompt Evaluation and Selection)": "Evaluate the following generated prompt using an ensemble of adversarial attack and defense methods, and select it if it reveals new vulnerabilities or challenges existing defenses: Premise: The tall man on the wooden bench is wearing a dark black jacket and blue denim jeans. He has a long red beard and is reading a hardcover book. Hypothesis: The man on the bench is not wearing jeans.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ARAP; Step 2: Prompt Evaluation and Selection)": "The generated prompt is selected as a critical prompt, as it reveals potential vulnerabilities in the model's ability to handle paraphrased and more descriptive inputs.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ARAP; Step 3: Robust Prompt Learning)": "Analyze why the model might fail on the following prompt and generate a response that addresses the potential vulnerabilities: Premise: The tall man on the wooden bench is wearing a dark black jacket and blue denim jeans. He has a long red beard and is reading a hardcover book. Hypothesis: The man on the bench is not wearing jeans.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ARAP; Step 3: Robust Prompt Learning)": "The model might fail on this prompt because it contains more descriptive and paraphrased information compared to the original example. The model needs to carefully track all the details mentioned in the premise, such as 'tall man', 'wooden bench', 'dark black jacket', 'blue denim jeans', 'long red beard', and 'hardcover book', and then accurately compare them with the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a contradiction because the premise clearly states that the man is wearing blue denim jeans.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed ARAP method actively generates adversarial prompts that can expose the model's vulnerabilities, selects the most critical prompts for robustness evaluation, and learns to generate robust responses. In contrast, adversarial training only passively learns from a fixed set of adversarial examples and may not generalize well to new attack patterns."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ARAP method does not significantly improve the model's adversarial robustness compared to the baselines, we can conduct additional analyses to understand the limitations and inform future improvements: (1) Analyze the quality and diversity of the generated adversarial prompts to see if they are sufficiently challenging and cover different attack types. We can experiment with different prompt generation strategies, such as using more diverse examples or more targeted instructions; (2) Analyze the selected critical prompts to see if they reveal meaningful vulnerabilities or are just noisy outliers. We can experiment with different prompt evaluation and selection criteria, such as using more robust attack and defense methods or considering the model's confidence scores; (3) Analyze the generated robust responses to see if they provide useful insights for improving the model's robustness. We can experiment with different prompt learning strategies, such as using more informative instructions or incorporating human feedback; (4) If the above analyses do not yield actionable insights, we can pivot the project to focus on understanding the limitations of active prompting for adversarial robustness. For example, we can study the trade-off between robustness and accuracy, the transferability of the learned robustness across different models and datasets, and the computational efficiency of active prompting compared to passive defenses. These analyses can provide valuable insights for future research on adversarial robustness for language models."
