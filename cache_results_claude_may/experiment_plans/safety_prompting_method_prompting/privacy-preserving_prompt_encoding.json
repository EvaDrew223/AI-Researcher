        "Problem": "Large language models are often trained on sensitive data, such as personal information or confidential documents. Adversarial actors may attempt to extract this sensitive information from the model by crafting specific prompts that exploit the model's memorization capabilities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches to address this issue include differential privacy, federated learning, and secure multi-party computation. However, these methods often require significant computational overhead or may impact the model's performance.",
        "Motivation": "Privacy-preserving techniques, such as homomorphic encryption and secure enclaves, have been successfully applied to protect sensitive data in various domains. By integrating these techniques into the prompt encoding process, we can ensure that sensitive information is not leaked through the model's outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a privacy-preserving prompt encoding approach that utilizes homomorphic encryption and secure enclaves to protect sensitive information during the prompt-model interaction. The sensitive parts of the input prompt are encrypted using a homomorphic encryption scheme, allowing the language model to process the encrypted data without direct access to the plaintext. The decryption and generation of the final output are performed within a secure enclave, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed to the outside world. To maintain the language model's performance, we investigate techniques such as encrypted fine-tuning and encrypted prompt template learning, which enable the model to adapt to the encrypted prompts while preserving privacy.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on datasets containing sensitive information and assess its ability to prevent information leakage through adversarial prompts. Compare the method's performance with baseline approaches, such as differential privacy and federated learning. Conduct experiments to measure the impact of encryption on the model's output quality and the computational overhead introduced by the privacy-preserving techniques. Additionally, analyze the method's robustness to various types of adversarial attacks, such as membership inference and model inversion."
