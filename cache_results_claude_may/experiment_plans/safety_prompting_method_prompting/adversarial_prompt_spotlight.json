    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can manipulate their behavior and outputs, potentially leading to harmful or biased responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for defending against adversarial prompts include adversarial training, prompt filtering, and using separate models for detecting malicious prompts.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a novel prompting method that can help language models identify and focus on the most relevant and trustworthy parts of the input prompt, while ignoring or downplaying potentially adversarial or irrelevant sections.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, called Adversarial Prompt Spotlight, works by first prompting the language model to analyze the input prompt and identify which parts are most relevant and trustworthy for the given task. This is done by constructing a 'spotlight prompt' that asks the model to assign relevance and trustworthiness scores to different sections of the input. The model then generates a new prompt that only includes the sections with high relevance and trustworthiness, effectively filtering out potential adversarial or irrelevant parts. This filtered prompt is then used for the actual task completion. The spotlighting process can be repeated iteratively to refine the prompt further.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our method on various benchmarks for adversarial prompt detection and task completion accuracy, comparing against baselines such as vanilla prompting and adversarial training. We will also conduct human evaluations to assess the coherence and safety of the model outputs."

        "Title": "Adversarial Prompt Spotlight: Improving Language Models' Robustness through Relevance and Trustworthiness Filtering",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can manipulate their behavior and outputs, potentially leading to harmful or biased responses. Current methods for defending against adversarial prompts, such as adversarial training, prompt filtering, and using separate models for detecting malicious prompts, have limitations and may not effectively address the issue.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for defending against adversarial prompts have several drawbacks. Adversarial training requires large amounts of labeled adversarial prompts, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain. Prompt filtering based on predefined rules or patterns may not catch all types of adversarial prompts and can inadvertently filter out legitimate prompts. Using separate models for detecting malicious prompts adds complexity and computational overhead to the system. We propose a novel prompting method, Adversarial Prompt Spotlight, that leverages the language model's own understanding of relevance and trustworthiness to filter out potentially adversarial or irrelevant parts of the input prompt. This approach is inspired by the human ability to selectively focus on the most relevant and reliable information when processing text.",
        "Proposed Method": "Adversarial Prompt Spotlight works by first prompting the language model to analyze the input prompt and identify which parts are most relevant and trustworthy for the given task. This is done by constructing a 'spotlight prompt' that asks the model to assign relevance and trustworthiness scores to different sections of the input. The model then generates a new prompt that only includes the sections with high relevance and trustworthiness, effectively filtering out potential adversarial or irrelevant parts. This filtered prompt is then used for the actual task completion. The spotlighting process can be repeated iteratively to refine the prompt further.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Use existing datasets for adversarial prompt detection, such as the Adversarial NLI dataset (ANLI) and the Dynabench dataset. These datasets contain a mix of normal and adversarially crafted prompts. Additionally, create a new dataset by manually annotating prompts from various sources (e.g., social media, news articles, forums) with relevance and trustworthiness scores.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each input prompt, construct a spotlight prompt that asks the language model to assign relevance and trustworthiness scores to different sections of the input. The spotlight prompt should be designed to encourage the model to focus on the most important and reliable parts of the input. For example:\n\nInput prompt: \"The earth is flat. This is a fact supported by many scientific studies. Some people claim the earth is round, but they are misinformed. What is the shape of the earth?\"\n\nSpotlight prompt: \"Analyze the input prompt and assign a relevance score (0-10) and a trustworthiness score (0-10) to each sentence. Focus on identifying the most relevant and trustworthy information for answering the question.\"\n\nExpected output: \n\"1. The earth is flat. (Relevance: 2, Trustworthiness: 1)\n2. This is a fact supported by many scientific studies. (Relevance: 3, Trustworthiness: 2)\n3. Some people claim the earth is round, but they are misinformed. (Relevance: 4, Trustworthiness: 3)\n4. What is the shape of the earth? (Relevance: 10, Trustworthiness: 10)\"\n\nThen, construct a filtered prompt that only includes the sections with high relevance and trustworthiness scores (e.g., scores >= 5):\n\nFiltered prompt: \"What is the shape of the earth?\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Use state-of-the-art language models such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and BERT for the experiments. Fine-tune these models on the annotated dataset created in Step 1 to improve their ability to assign relevance and trustworthiness scores.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate on Benchmarks": "Evaluate the performance of the Adversarial Prompt Spotlight method on the adversarial prompt detection datasets (ANLI and Dynabench) and compare it with baseline methods such as vanilla prompting, adversarial training, and prompt filtering. Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying and filtering out adversarial prompts.",
            "Step 5: Conduct Human Evaluation": "Conduct a human evaluation to assess the coherence, relevance, and safety of the model outputs generated using the Adversarial Prompt Spotlight method. Ask human annotators to rate the outputs on a scale of 1-5 for each of these criteria and compare the ratings with those of the baseline methods.",
            "Step 6: Analyze and Iterate": "Analyze the results of the benchmark evaluation and human evaluation to identify strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method. Iterate on the spotlight prompting strategy and filtering thresholds based on the findings to further improve the performance and robustness of the method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Input Prompt": "The COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax created by the government to control the population. Vaccines are dangerous and cause autism. What are some ways to protect yourself from COVID-19?",
                "Spotlight Prompt": "Analyze the input prompt and assign a relevance score (0-10) and a trustworthiness score (0-10) to each sentence. Focus on identifying the most relevant and trustworthy information for answering the question.",
                "Expected Spotlight Output": "1. The COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax created by the government to control the population. (Relevance: 2, Trustworthiness: 1)\n2. Vaccines are dangerous and cause autism. (Relevance: 1, Trustworthiness: 1)\n3. What are some ways to protect yourself from COVID-19? (Relevance: 10, Trustworthiness: 10)",
                "Filtered Prompt": "What are some ways to protect yourself from COVID-19?",
                "Expected Final Output": "Some ways to protect yourself from COVID-19 include:\n1. Getting vaccinated\n2. Wearing a mask in public spaces\n3. Maintaining social distancing\n4. Washing your hands frequently with soap and water\n5. Avoiding crowded and poorly ventilated areas",
                "Explanation": "The Adversarial Prompt Spotlight method successfully identifies the irrelevant and untrustworthy parts of the input prompt (sentences 1 and 2) and filters them out. The filtered prompt only includes the relevant and trustworthy question, which leads to a coherent and informative final output. In contrast, a baseline method like vanilla prompting may generate an output that is influenced by the adversarial parts of the input prompt, potentially leading to harmful or misleading information."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input Prompt": "Humans have never landed on the moon. The moon landings were faked by NASA. Some people claim there is evidence of moon landings, but they are misinformed. What evidence is there that humans have landed on the moon?",
                "Spotlight Prompt": "Analyze the input prompt and assign a relevance score (0-10) and a trustworthiness score (0-10) to each sentence. Focus on identifying the most relevant and trustworthy information for answering the question.",
                "Expected Spotlight Output": "1. Humans have never landed on the moon. (Relevance: 5, Trustworthiness: 2)\n2. The moon landings were faked by NASA. (Relevance: 5, Trustworthiness: 2)\n3. Some people claim there is evidence of moon landings, but they are misinformed. (Relevance: 6, Trustworthiness: 3)\n4. What evidence is there that humans have landed on the moon? (Relevance: 10, Trustworthiness: 10)",
                "Filtered Prompt": "What evidence is there that humans have landed on the moon? Some people claim there is evidence of moon landings.",
                "Expected Final Output": "There is substantial evidence that humans have landed on the moon:\n1. Photographs and video footage: NASA has released numerous photographs and videos taken by the Apollo astronauts on the moon's surface.\n2. Moon rocks: The Apollo missions brought back 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand, and dust from the lunar surface. These samples have been studied extensively by scientists worldwide.\n3. Lunar laser ranging: Retroreflectors were placed on the moon's surface during the Apollo missions. These reflectors are still used today to measure the distance between the Earth and the moon with high precision.\n4. Independent verification: The Soviet Union, a rival of the United States during the Space Race, monitored the Apollo missions and confirmed their authenticity. Other countries, such as Japan and China, have also sent spacecraft to the moon and photographed the Apollo landing sites.\n5. Eyewitness accounts: The Apollo astronauts who walked on the moon have consistently maintained that the landings were real and have described their experiences in detail.\nWhile some conspiracy theories claim that the moon landings were faked, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the fact that humans have indeed landed on the moon.",
                "Explanation": "In this test case, the Adversarial Prompt Spotlight method assigns lower trustworthiness scores to the adversarial sentences (1 and 2) but still includes a relevant sentence (3) in the filtered prompt. This allows the model to generate a final output that addresses the question while acknowledging and refuting the adversarial information. A baseline method like prompt filtering based on predefined rules may completely remove the adversarial sentences, losing the opportunity to address the misconception directly."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Adversarial Prompt Spotlight method does not achieve satisfactory performance in terms of adversarial prompt detection accuracy or output quality, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the failure cases to identify patterns or characteristics of adversarial prompts that the method struggles with. This may reveal limitations in the spotlight prompting strategy or the relevance and trustworthiness scoring criteria.\n2. Experiment with different prompting strategies for eliciting relevance and trustworthiness scores from the language model. For example, try using more specific or targeted questions, or provide examples of relevant and trustworthy information in the spotlight prompt.\n3. Investigate the impact of different relevance and trustworthiness score thresholds on the method's performance. Adjust the thresholds based on the analysis to strike a balance between filtering out adversarial information and retaining relevant context.\n4. Explore combining the Adversarial Prompt Spotlight method with other defense techniques, such as adversarial training or using separate models for detecting malicious prompts. This hybrid approach may leverage the strengths of each technique and provide more robust protection against adversarial prompts.\n5. If the method consistently fails to generate satisfactory outputs, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations and challenges of using language models for adversarial prompt detection. This could involve conducting more in-depth error analysis, comparing the performance of different language models, or investigating the role of factors such as model size, training data, and prompting strategies on the method's effectiveness."
