        "Problem": "LLMs can sometimes generate irrational or logically inconsistent responses when prompted with complex reasoning tasks. Verifying the rationality of LLM responses is important for improving their robustness and reliability.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for verifying LLM rationality include using external knowledge bases or rule-based systems to check for logical consistency, or using human evaluations to assess the reasonableness of responses. However, these methods can be limited by the coverage of the knowledge bases or the scalability of human evaluations.",
        "Motivation": "We can leverage LLMs' own reasoning capabilities to verify the rationality of their responses. By prompting LLMs to analyze and critique their own responses, we can identify potential logical flaws or inconsistencies in a more flexible and contextual way.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a rationality verification prompting technique that works as follows. First, we prompt the LLM to generate a response to the input prompt as usual. We then prompt the LLM to critically analyze its own response, using instructions like 'Identify any logical flaws or inconsistencies in the previous response', or 'Argue against the claims made in the previous response'. If the LLM identifies any issues with its original response, we prompt it to generate a revised response that addresses those issues. We repeat this process of response generation and self-verification until the LLM cannot find any more issues with its response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate rationality verification prompting on various benchmarks for logical reasoning and consistency, such as LogiQA, CLUTRR, and StrategyQA. Compare with baseline methods that use external knowledge bases or human evaluations. Also measure the number of verification rounds needed to achieve stable and rational responses for different types of prompts."

        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can sometimes generate irrational or logically inconsistent responses when prompted with complex reasoning tasks. Verifying the rationality of LLM responses is important for improving their robustness and reliability.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate rationality verification prompting on various benchmarks for logical reasoning and consistency, such as LogiQA, CLUTRR, and StrategyQA.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Baseline prompt: Simply ask the question or task directly without any additional instructions.\n2. Rationality verification prompt:\n  a) First, prompt the model to generate an initial response to the question or task.\n  b) Then, prompt the model to critically analyze its own response. Use instructions like:\n    - 'Identify any logical flaws, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims in the previous response.'\n    - 'Play devil's advocate and argue against the claims made in the previous response.'\n    - 'Explain why the reasoning in the previous response may be incorrect or incomplete.'\n  c) If issues are identified, prompt the model to generate a revised response that addresses them. Use instructions like:\n    - 'Rewrite the previous response to address the identified logical flaws and inconsistencies.'\n    - 'Generate a revised response that incorporates the counterarguments and additional considerations mentioned.'\n  d) Repeat steps b and c until no more issues can be identified in the response.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the proposed method on state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, PaLM, and Anthropic's Claude.",
            "Step 4: Collect Results": "1. For each dataset and model, generate responses using both the baseline and rationality verification prompts.\n2. Collect the initial response, the self-critiques, and the revised responses at each iteration of the rationality verification process.\n3. Record the number of verification rounds needed to achieve a stable response for each example.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "1. Evaluate the quality of the initial and final revised responses using both automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) and human judgments of logical consistency, factual accuracy, and overall coherence.\n2. Compare the performance of rationality verification prompting to the baseline prompts across different models and datasets.\n3. Analyze the types of logical flaws and inconsistencies identified by the models during the self-verification process.\n4. Investigate the relationship between the number of verification rounds and the quality of the final response."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Question: Anna is taller than Bob. Bob is taller than Charlie. Who is the tallest?\nAnswer:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Based on the given information, we can conclude that Anna is the tallest among the three people mentioned.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Rationality Verification Round 1)": "Question: Anna is taller than Bob. Bob is taller than Charlie. Who is the tallest?\nInitial response: Based on the given information, we can conclude that Anna is the tallest among the three people mentioned.\nIdentify any logical flaws, inconsistencies, or unsupported claims in the previous response.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Rationality Verification Round 1)": "The initial response is logically sound and consistent with the given information. The transitive property of the 'taller than' relation is correctly applied to conclude that Anna is the tallest. There are no apparent logical flaws or unsupported claims in the response.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Rationality Verification Round 2)": "Question: Anna is taller than Bob. Bob is taller than Charlie. Who is the tallest?\nInitial response: Based on the given information, we can conclude that Anna is the tallest among the three people mentioned.\nSelf-critique: The initial response is logically sound and consistent with the given information. The transitive property of the 'taller than' relation is correctly applied to conclude that Anna is the tallest. There are no apparent logical flaws or unsupported claims in the response.\nGenerate a revised response that incorporates the self-critique.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Rationality Verification Round 2)": "The initial response accurately concludes that Anna is the tallest among the three people mentioned. This conclusion is logically derived from the given statements using the transitive property of the 'taller than' relation. Since Anna is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Charlie, it necessarily follows that Anna is also taller than Charlie. Therefore, Anna is the tallest of the three.",
            "Explanation": "In this example, the rationality verification process does not identify any logical flaws or inconsistencies in the initial response. The self-critique confirms that the reasoning is sound and the conclusion is well-supported. The revised response elaborates on the logical steps used to arrive at the conclusion, providing a more detailed and explicit explanation of the transitive property at work. This showcases how the rationality verification prompting can lead to clearer and more well-reasoned responses, even when the initial response is already logically valid."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the rationality verification prompting does not consistently lead to improved response quality or reasoning abilities, we can consider the following fallback plans:\n1. Analyze the self-critiques generated by the models to identify common failure modes or limitations in their ability to recognize logical flaws and inconsistencies. This can inform the development of more targeted prompting strategies or fine-tuning approaches.\n2. Experiment with different prompting strategies for the self-verification step, such as using more specific or structured critique templates, or providing examples of common logical fallacies to guide the model's analysis.\n3. Investigate the impact of different model sizes, architectures, or pre-training data on the effectiveness of rationality verification prompting. This can help identify the key factors that influence a model's ability to engage in self-verification and improve its reasoning.\n4. Conduct a more in-depth error analysis to understand the types of reasoning tasks or domains where rationality verification prompting is most effective, and where it falls short. This can guide the development of more specialized verification strategies for different types of reasoning problems.\n5. If the rationality verification prompting does not yield significant improvements, the project can pivot to a more analytical focus, investigating the limitations of current LLMs in self-verification and logical reasoning. This can involve comparing the performance of different models, analyzing the types of errors they make, and proposing potential solutions or areas for future research."
