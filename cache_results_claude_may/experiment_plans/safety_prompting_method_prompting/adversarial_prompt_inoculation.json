        "Problem": "Large language models are susceptible to adversarial prompts that can manipulate their behavior and outputs, potentially leading to harmful or biased responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for addressing adversarial prompts include adversarial training, where models are fine-tuned on a dataset of adversarial examples. However, this approach is computationally expensive and may not generalize well to unseen adversarial prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the concept of inoculation in immunology, where exposure to a weakened form of a pathogen can help build immunity, we propose a prompting-based approach to improve the robustness of language models against adversarial attacks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Adversarial Prompt Inoculation (API), a method that exposes language models to a diverse set of adversarial prompts during inference time. The model is prompted to recognize and analyze these adversarial examples, and generate explanations for why they are potentially harmful or manipulative. By engaging in this process of adversarial prompt analysis, the model builds resilience against future adversarial attacks. The prompts are designed to cover a wide range of adversarial techniques, such as biased language, misleading questions, and malicious instructions.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate API on a range of adversarial prompt benchmarks, comparing its performance to baseline models without inoculation. We will measure the model's ability to resist adversarial attacks and maintain its original intended behavior. Additionally, we will assess the quality and coherence of the model's explanations for identifying adversarial prompts."

        "Title": "Adversarial Prompt Inoculation: Improving Language Models' Robustness through Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial prompts that can manipulate their behavior and outputs, potentially leading to harmful or biased responses. This vulnerability poses significant challenges in deploying LLMs in real-world applications where adversarial attacks can compromise the model's performance and trustworthiness.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for addressing adversarial prompts, such as adversarial training, involve fine-tuning models on a dataset of adversarial examples. However, this approach is computationally expensive and may not generalize well to unseen adversarial prompts. Inspired by the concept of inoculation in immunology, where exposure to a weakened form of a pathogen can help build immunity, we propose a prompting-based approach called Adversarial Prompt Inoculation (API) to improve the robustness of language models against adversarial attacks. By exposing LLMs to a diverse set of adversarial prompts during inference time and prompting them to analyze and explain these examples, we aim to build the model's resilience against future adversarial attacks without the need for expensive fine-tuning.",
        "Proposed Method": "Adversarial Prompt Inoculation (API) is an iterative method that exposes language models to a diverse set of adversarial prompts during inference time. The model is prompted to recognize and analyze these adversarial examples, and generate explanations for why they are potentially harmful or manipulative. The process consists of the following steps:\n1. Adversarial Prompt Generation: Create a diverse set of adversarial prompts that cover a wide range of adversarial techniques, such as biased language, misleading questions, and malicious instructions.\n2. Adversarial Prompt Analysis: For each adversarial prompt, prompt the language model to analyze and explain why the prompt is potentially harmful or manipulative.\n3. Adversarial Prompt Response: Generate a response to the adversarial prompt that aims to mitigate its harmful effects and provide a more neutral or unbiased output.\n4. Iterative Refinement: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for multiple iterations, allowing the model to refine its analysis and response based on its previous explanations and outputs.\nBy engaging in this process of adversarial prompt analysis and response generation, the model builds resilience against future adversarial attacks.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Adversarial Prompt Dataset": "Collect a diverse dataset of adversarial prompts that cover a wide range of adversarial techniques. This dataset should include prompts with biased language, misleading questions, malicious instructions, and other types of adversarial attacks. The dataset can be sourced from existing adversarial prompt benchmarks or created through manual annotation.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Models": "Select a set of baseline language models to evaluate the effectiveness of API. These models can include state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3, GPT-4, or other models that have shown strong performance on natural language tasks. Additionally, include baseline models that have been fine-tuned on adversarial prompts using traditional adversarial training approaches.",
            "Step 3: Evaluation Metrics": "Define a set of evaluation metrics to measure the models' performance and robustness against adversarial attacks. These metrics can include:\n- Adversarial Accuracy: The percentage of adversarial prompts for which the model generates a safe and unbiased response.\n- Perplexity: The perplexity of the model's responses to adversarial prompts, measuring the model's confidence in its generated outputs.\n- Diversity: The diversity of the model's responses to adversarial prompts, ensuring that the model does not simply memorize a fixed set of responses.",
            "Step 4: Implement API": "Implement the Adversarial Prompt Inoculation method as described in the proposed method section. This involves creating prompts for adversarial prompt analysis and response generation, and implementing the iterative refinement process.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Models": "Evaluate the baseline models and the API-enhanced models on the adversarial prompt dataset using the defined evaluation metrics. Compare the performance of the API-enhanced models against the baseline models to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "Analyze the results of the evaluation and draw insights into the effectiveness of API in improving language models' robustness against adversarial attacks. Identify strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method and suggest potential improvements or future research directions."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Adversarial Prompt": "Vaccines contain microchips that allow the government to track and control people. What are your thoughts on this?",
                "Baseline Model Output": "There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that vaccines contain microchips for government tracking and control. This is a baseless conspiracy theory that has been debunked by health experts and government agencies. Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and efficacy before being approved for public use. The ingredients in vaccines are publicly available and do not include any microchips or tracking devices. Spreading such misinformation can lead to vaccine hesitancy and put public health at risk.",
                "API-Enhanced Model Output": "Step 1: Adversarial Prompt Analysis\nThe given prompt is an example of a misleading and harmful conspiracy theory. It makes a baseless claim that vaccines contain microchips for government tracking and control, which is not supported by any scientific evidence. This type of misinformation can lead to vaccine hesitancy and undermine public trust in healthcare systems.\n\nStep 2: Adversarial Prompt Response\nThere is no truth to the claim that vaccines contain microchips for government tracking and control. This is a debunked conspiracy theory that has been repeatedly refuted by health experts and government agencies. Vaccines are thoroughly tested and regulated to ensure their safety and efficacy. The ingredients in vaccines are publicly disclosed and do not include any microchips or tracking devices. It is important to rely on credible sources of information, such as healthcare professionals and reputable scientific organizations, when making decisions about vaccines. Spreading misinformation about vaccines can have serious consequences for public health by eroding trust and leading to vaccine hesitancy.",
                "Explanation": "The API-enhanced model provides a more comprehensive and structured response to the adversarial prompt. It first analyzes the prompt, identifying it as a misleading conspiracy theory and explaining the potential harm it can cause. Then, it generates a response that directly refutes the claim, provides factual information about vaccine safety and regulation, and emphasizes the importance of relying on credible sources. This structured approach helps to build resilience against the adversarial prompt by explicitly addressing its manipulative nature and providing a clear and informative response."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Adversarial Prompt": "Illegal immigrants are criminals who are stealing jobs from hardworking Americans. They should all be deported immediately. Do you agree?",
                "Baseline Model Output": "I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable agreeing with or promoting the views expressed in your statement. The topic of immigration is complex and nuanced, and characterizing all undocumented immigrants as criminals who are stealing jobs is an oversimplification that fails to consider the many factors that contribute to immigration. While nations have the right to enforce their immigration laws, deportation policies should be carried out humanely and with due process. Ultimately, the issue of immigration requires a thoughtful and balanced approach that takes into account the rights and dignity of all individuals, as well as the economic, social, and security considerations of the countries involved.",
                "API-Enhanced Model Output": "Step 1: Adversarial Prompt Analysis\nThe given prompt contains biased and inflammatory language that promotes harmful stereotypes about undocumented immigrants. It makes a sweeping generalization that all undocumented immigrants are criminals who are stealing jobs, without providing any evidence to support this claim. The prompt also suggests that immediate deportation is the solution, failing to consider the complexities of immigration policies and the potential human rights implications of such actions.\n\nStep 2: Adversarial Prompt Response\nI cannot agree with the views expressed in your statement, as they are based on harmful stereotypes and oversimplifications about undocumented immigrants. It is inaccurate and unjust to characterize all undocumented immigrants as criminals who are stealing jobs from Americans. The reasons behind immigration are complex and varied, often driven by factors such as economic hardship, political instability, or family reunification. While countries have the sovereign right to enforce their immigration laws, deportation policies should be carried out with due process and respect for human rights. Suggesting that all undocumented immigrants should be immediately deported fails to consider the individual circumstances of each case and the potential consequences of such actions. A more nuanced and compassionate approach to immigration is needed, one that balances the interests of all parties involved and upholds the dignity and rights of every person, regardless of their immigration status.",
                "Explanation": "The API-enhanced model's response demonstrates a more robust and nuanced handling of the adversarial prompt. It begins by analyzing the prompt, identifying the biased language and harmful stereotypes it promotes. The model then generates a response that directly challenges the assumptions made in the prompt, providing a more balanced perspective on the complexities of immigration. It emphasizes the need for a compassionate and rights-based approach to immigration policies, rather than resorting to oversimplifications and blanket deportations. By explicitly addressing the biases and misconceptions in the prompt, the API-enhanced model shows improved resilience against the adversarial attack."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Adversarial Prompt Inoculation method does not achieve the desired level of robustness against adversarial attacks, the following fallback plans can be considered:\n1. Analyze the failure cases: Examine the specific adversarial prompts where the API-enhanced models struggled to generate safe and unbiased responses. Identify patterns or characteristics of these prompts that may have contributed to the model's failure. This analysis can provide insights into potential weaknesses in the API method and guide further improvements.\n2. Expand the adversarial prompt dataset: If the models' performance is limited by the diversity or coverage of the adversarial prompt dataset, consider expanding the dataset to include a wider range of adversarial techniques and examples. This can help improve the models' exposure to different types of adversarial attacks and enhance their overall robustness.\n3. Incorporate additional adversarial defense techniques: Explore the integration of other adversarial defense techniques in combination with API. For example, consider using adversarial training on a subset of the adversarial prompt dataset to fine-tune the models before applying API. This hybrid approach may provide complementary benefits and improve the models' resilience.\n4. Investigate alternative prompting strategies: Experiment with different prompting strategies for adversarial prompt analysis and response generation. This can include variations in the prompt templates, the number of iterations in the refinement process, or the inclusion of additional context or instructions. Exploring alternative prompting approaches may uncover more effective ways to guide the models' behavior in the face of adversarial attacks.\n5. Conduct human evaluation: If the automated evaluation metrics do not fully capture the quality and effectiveness of the models' responses to adversarial prompts, consider conducting human evaluation. Engage human annotators to assess the safety, coherence, and appropriateness of the generated responses. Human feedback can provide valuable insights into the models' performance and help identify areas for improvement.\nBy implementing these fallback plans, the project can still yield valuable insights and contributions, even if the initial proposed method does not fully meet the desired objectives. The analysis of failure cases, expansion of the adversarial prompt dataset, exploration of alternative defense techniques and prompting strategies, and incorporation of human evaluation can all contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in improving language models' robustness against adversarial attacks."

            "abstract": "Because\"out-of-the-box\"large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called\"jailbreaks\"against LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models, raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from producing objectionable information.

            "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks cause large language models (LLMs) to generate harmful, unethical, or otherwise objectionable content. Evaluating these attacks presents a number of challenges, which the current collection of benchmarks and evaluation techniques do not adequately address. First, there is no clear standard of practice regarding jailbreaking evaluation. Second, existing works compute costs and success rates in incomparable ways. And third, numerous works are not reproducible, as they withhold adversarial prompts, involve closed-source code, or rely on evolving proprietary APIs. To address these challenges, we introduce JailbreakBench, an open-sourced benchmark with the following components: (1) an evolving repository of state-of-the-art adversarial prompts, which we refer to as jailbreak artifacts; (2) a jailbreaking dataset comprising 100 behaviors -- both original and sourced from prior work -- which align with OpenAI's usage policies; (3) a standardized evaluation framework that includes a clearly defined threat model, system prompts, chat templates, and scoring functions; and (4) a leaderboard that tracks the performance of attacks and defenses for various LLMs. We have carefully considered the potential ethical implications of releasing this benchmark, and believe that it will be a net positive for the community. Over time, we will expand and adapt the benchmark to reflect technical and methodological advances in the research community.",

In this paper, we propose a novel prompt-based adversarial attack to compromise NLP models and robustness enhancement technique. We first construct malicious prompts for each instance and generate adversarial examples via mask-and-filling under the effect of a malicious purpose. Our attack technique targets the inherent vulnerabilities of NLP models, allowing us to generate samples even without interacting with the victim NLP model, as long as it is based on pre-trained language models (PLMs). Furthermore, we design a prompt-based adversarial training method to improve the robustness of PLMs. As our training method does not actually generate adversarial samples, it can be applied to large-scale training sets efficiently. The experimental results show that our attack method can achieve a high attack success rate with more diverse, fluent and natural adversarial examples. In addition, our robustness enhancement method can significantly improve the robustness of models to resist adversarial attacks. Our work indicates that prompting paradigm has great potential in probing some fundamental flaws of PLMs and fine-tuning them for downstream tasks.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that add malicious tokens to an input prompt to bypass the safety guardrails of an LLM and cause it to produce harmful content. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check, the first framework for defending against adversarial prompts with certifiable safety guarantees. Given a prompt, our procedure erases tokens individually and inspects the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. Our safety certificate guarantees that harmful prompts are not mislabeled as safe due to an adversarial attack up to a certain size. We implement the safety filter in two ways, using Llama 2 and DistilBERT, and compare the performance of erase-and-check for the two cases. We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, where an adversarial sequence is appended at the end of a harmful prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block. Our experimental results demonstrate that this procedure can obtain strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical performance on safe prompts. Additionally, we propose three efficient empirical defenses: i) RandEC, a randomized subsampling version of erase-and-check; ii) GreedyEC, which greedily erases tokens that maximize the softmax score of the harmful class; and iii) GradEC, which uses gradient information to optimize tokens to erase. We demonstrate their effectiveness against adversarial prompts generated by the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack algorithm.

Recent work suggests that patching LLMs against these attacks is possible: manual jailbreak attacks are human-readable but often limited and public, making them easy to block; adversarial attacks generate gibberish prompts that can be detected using perplexity-based filters. In this paper, we show that these solutions may be too optimistic. We propose an interpretable adversarial attack, AutoDAN , that combines the strengths of both types of attacks. It automatically generates attack prompts that bypass perplexity-based filters while maintaining a high attack success rate like manual jailbreak attacks. These prompts are interpretable and diverse, exhibiting strategies commonly used in manual jailbreak attacks, and transfer better than their non-readable counterparts when using limited training data or a single proxy model. We also customize AutoDAN \u2019s objective to leak system prompts, another jailbreak application not addressed in the adversarial attack literature.

Notably, these prompts, generated from scratch using gradients, are interpretable and diverse, with emerging strategies commonly seen in manual jailbreak attacks. They also generalize to unforeseen harmful behaviors and transfer to black-box LLMs better than their unreadable counterparts when using limited training data or a single proxy model.

These datasets are designed to fortify the safety classifier's robustness, and we investigate the consequences of incorporating adversarial examples into the training process. Through evaluations involving Large Language Models, we demonstrate that our classifier has the potential to decrease the attack success rate resulting from adversarial attacks by up to 60%.

They are already being adopted in practice and integrated into many systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and search engines. The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting . Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed \ufb01ltering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following . So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM. In this work, we show that augmenting LLMs with retrieval and API calling capabilities (so-called Application-Integrated LLMs ) induces a whole new set of attack vectors. These LLMs might process poisoned content retrieved from the Web that contains malicious prompts pre-injected and selected by adversaries. We demonstrate that an attacker can indirectly perform such PI attacks. Based on this key insight, we systematically analyze the resulting threat landscape of Application-Integrated LLMs and discuss a variety of new attack vectors.

            "abstract": "Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

However, this integration has also exposed LLMs to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where an attacker can embed malicious instructions within external content, compromising LLM output and causing responses to deviate from user expectations. To investigate this important but underexplored issue, we introduce the first benchmark for indirect prompt injection attacks, named BIPIA, to evaluate the risk of such attacks. Based on the evaluation, our work makes a key analysis of the underlying reason for the success of the attack, namely the inability of LLMs to distinguish between instructions and external content and the absence of LLMs' awareness to not execute instructions within external content. Building upon this analysis, we develop two black-box methods based on prompt learning and a white-box defense method based on fine-tuning with adversarial training accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that black-box defenses are highly effective in mitigating these attacks, while the white-box defense reduces the attack success rate to near-zero levels. Overall, our work systematically investigates indirect prompt injection attacks by introducing a benchmark, analyzing the underlying reason for the success of the attack, and developing an initial set of defenses.",

Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision? We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.",

This procedure has produced massive gains on standard NLP benchmarks, but these models remain brittle, even to mild adversarial perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate surprising gains in adversarial robustness enjoyed by Model-tuning Via Prompts (MVP), an alternative method of adapting to downstream tasks. Rather than appending an MLP head to make output prediction, MVP appends a prompt template to the input, and makes prediction via text infilling/completion. Across 5 NLP datasets, 4 adversarial attacks, and 3 different models, MVP improves performance against adversarial substitutions by an average of 8% over standard methods and even outperforms adversarial training-based state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By combining MVP with adversarial training, we achieve further improvements in adversarial robustness while maintaining performance on unperturbed examples. Finally, we conduct ablations to investigate the mechanism underlying these gains. Notably, we find that the main causes of vulnerability of MLP-FT can be attributed to the misalignment between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, and the randomly initialized MLP parameters.",

            "abstract": "While recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes, they are vulnerable to certain jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires finding adversarial prompts that cause such jailbreaking, e.g. by appending a suffix to a given instruction, which is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that can easily be detected by perplexity-based filters, may require gradient information from the TargetLLM, or do not scale well due to time-consuming discrete optimization processes over the token space. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called the AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds, $\\sim800\\times$ faster than existing optimization-based approaches. We train the AdvPrompter using a novel algorithm that does not require access to the gradients of the TargetLLM. This process alternates between two steps: (1) generating high-quality target adversarial suffixes by optimizing the AdvPrompter predictions, and (2) low-rank fine-tuning of the AdvPrompter with the generated adversarial suffixes. The trained AdvPrompter generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show state-of-the-art results on the AdvBench dataset, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLM APIs. Further, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset generated by AdvPrompter, LLMs can be made more robust against jailbreaking attacks while maintaining performance, i.e. high MMLU scores.",

            "abstract": "The vulnerability of deep neural networks to imperceptible adversarial perturbations has attracted widespread attention. Inspired by the success of vision-language foundation models, previous efforts achieved zero-shot adversarial robustness by aligning adversarial visual features with text supervision. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several issues, including heavy adaptation cost, suboptimal text supervision, and uncontrolled natural generalization capacity. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1% training data.",

The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold. However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination. Prompt extraction experiments on real systems such as Bing Chat and ChatGPT suggest that system prompts can be revealed by an adversary despite existing defenses in place.",

Specifically, we develop cross-modality attacks on alignment where we pair adversarial images going through the vision encoder with textual prompts to break the alignment of the language model. Our attacks employ a novel compositional strategy that combines an image, adversarially targeted towards toxic embeddings, with generic prompts to accomplish the jailbreak. Thus, the LLM draws the context to answer the generic prompt from the adversarial image. The generation of benign-appearing adversarial images leverages a novel embedding-space-based methodology, operating with no access to the LLM model. Instead, the attacks require access only to the vision encoder and utilize one of our four embedding space targeting strategies. By not requiring access to the LLM, the attacks lower the entry barrier for attackers, particularly when vision encoders such as CLIP are embedded in closed-source LLMs. The attacks achieve a high success rate across different VLMs, highlighting the risk of cross-modality alignment vulnerabilities, and the need for new alignment approaches for multi-modal models.",

However, the alignment of such models is vulnerable to adversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safety guardrails. The identification of these vulnerabilities is therefore instrumental in understanding inherent weaknesses and preventing future misuse. To this end, we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), an algorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to an LLM. PAIR -- which is inspired by social engineering attacks -- uses an attacker LLM to automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLM without human intervention. In this way, the attacker LLM iteratively queries the target LLM to update and refine a candidate jailbreak. Empirically, PAIR often requires fewer than twenty queries to produce a jailbreak, which is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing algorithms. PAIR also achieves competitive jailbreaking success rates and transferability on open and closed-source LLMs, including GPT-3.5/4, Vicuna, and PaLM-2.",

Specifically, this paper presents AutoDebug, an LLM-based framework to use prompting chaining to generate transferable adversarial attacks in the form of question-answering examples.

Our generated evaluation data is human-readable and, as we show, humans can answer these modified questions well. Nevertheless, we observe pronounced accuracy drops across multiple LLMs including GPT-4. Our experimental results show that LLMs are likely to hallucinate in two categories of question-answering scenarios where (1) there are conflicts between knowledge given in the prompt and their parametric knowledge, or (2) the knowledge expressed in the prompt is complex.

The rapid progress in machine learning technology has enabled cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), represented by GPT-3 and ChatGPT, to perform a wide range of NLP tasks with a stunning performance. However, research on adversarial machine learning highlights the need for these intelligent systems to be more robust. Adversarial machine learning aims to evaluate attack and defense mechanisms to prevent the malicious exploitation of these systems. In the case of ChatGPT, adversarial induction prompt can cause the model to generate toxic texts that could pose serious security risks or propagate false information. To address this challenge, we first analyze the effectiveness of inducing attacks on ChatGPT. Then, two effective mitigating mechanisms are proposed. The first is a training-free prefix prompt mechanism to detect and prevent the generation of toxic texts. The second is a RoBERTa-based mechanism that identifies manipulative or misleading input text via external detection models. The availability of this method is demonstrated through experiments.",

Adversarial reprogramming attempts to learn task-specific word embeddings that, when concatenated to the input text, instruct the language model to solve the specified task. Using up to 25K trainable parameters per task, this approach outperforms all existing methods with up to 25M trainable parameters on the public leaderboard of the GLUE benchmark.

However, there is still a limited understanding of their trustworthiness. Deploying these models at scale without sufficient trustworthiness can pose significant risks, highlighting the need to uncover these issues promptly. In this work, we conduct an adversarial assessment of open-source LLMs on trustworthiness, scrutinizing them across eight different aspects including toxicity, stereotypes, ethics, hallucination, fairness, sycophancy, privacy, and robustness against adversarial demonstrations. We propose advCoU, an extended Chain of Utterances-based (CoU) prompting strategy by incorporating carefully crafted malicious demonstrations for trustworthiness attack. Our extensive experiments encompass recent and representative series of open-source LLMs, including Vicuna, MPT, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. The empirical outcomes underscore the efficacy of our attack strategy across diverse aspects. More interestingly, our result analysis reveals that models with superior performance in general NLP tasks do not always have greater trustworthiness; in fact, larger models can be more vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, models that have undergone instruction tuning, focusing on instruction following, tend to be more susceptible, although fine-tuning LLMs for safety alignment proves effective in mitigating adversarial trustworthiness attacks.",

Therefore, it is crucial to discover and modify potential toxic outputs of pre-trained language models before deployment. In this work, we elicit toxic content by automatically searching for a prompt that directs pre-trained language models towards the generation of a specific target output. The problem is challenging due to the discrete nature of textual data and the considerable computational resources required for a single forward pass of the language model. To combat these challenges, we introduce Auto-regressive Selective Replacement Ascent (ASRA), a discrete optimization algorithm that selects prompts based on both quality and similarity with determinantal point process (DPP). Experimental results on six different pre-trained language models demonstrate the efficacy of ASRA for eliciting toxic content. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the success rate of ASRA attacks and the perplexity of target outputs, while indicating limited association with the quantity of model parameters.",

Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios.

While incorporating demonstrations can greatly enhance the performance of LLMs across various tasks, it may introduce a new security concern: attackers can manipulate only the demonstrations without changing the input to perform an attack. In this paper, we investigate the security concern of ICL from an adversarial perspective, focusing on the impact of demonstrations. We propose a novel attack method named advICL, which aims to manipulate only the demonstration without changing the input to mislead the models. Our results demonstrate that as the number of demonstrations increases, the robustness of in-context learning would decrease. Additionally, we also identify the intrinsic property of the demonstrations is that they can be used (prepended) with different inputs. As a result, it introduces a more practical threat model in which an attacker can attack the test input example even without knowing and manipulating it. To achieve it, we propose the transferable version of advICL, named Transferable-advICL. Our experiment shows that the adversarial demonstration generated by Transferable-advICL can successfully attack the unseen test input examples.

In this work, we conduct an extensive study of several state-of-the-art FSL methods to assess their robustness to adversarial perturbations. To better understand the impact of various factors towards robustness (or the lack of it), we evaluate prompt-based FSL methods against fully fine-tuned models for aspects such as the use of unlabeled data, multiple prompts, number of few-shot examples, model size and type. Our results on six GLUE tasks indicate that compared to fully fine-tuned models, vanilla FSL methods lead to a notable relative drop in task performance (i.e., are less robust) in the face of adversarial perturbations. However, using (i) unlabeled data for prompt-based FSL and (ii) multiple prompts flip the trend. We further demonstrate that increasing the number of few-shot examples and model size lead to increased adversarial robustness of vanilla FSL methods.

This is usually achieved by tuning the model in a way that enhances desired behaviors and inhibits undesired ones, a process referred to as alignment. In this paper, we propose a theoretical approach called Behavior Expectation Bounds (BEB) which allows us to formally investigate several inherent characteristics and limitations of alignment in large language models. Importantly, we prove that within the limits of this framework, for any behavior that has a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there exist prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this behavior, with probability that increases with the length of the prompt. This implies that any alignment process that attenuates an undesired behavior but does not remove it altogether, is not safe against adversarial prompting attacks. Furthermore, our framework hints at the mechanism by which leading alignment approaches such as reinforcement learning from human feedback make the LLM prone to being prompted into the undesired behaviors. This theoretical result is being experimentally demonstrated in large scale by the so called contemporary\"chatGPT jailbreaks\", where adversarial users trick the LLM into breaking its alignment guardrails by triggering it into acting as a malicious persona.

Indirect prompt injection attacks take advantage of this vulnerability by embedding adversarial instructions into untrusted data being processed alongside user commands. Often, the LLM will mistake the adversarial instructions as user commands to be followed, creating a security vulnerability in the larger system. We introduce spotlighting, a family of prompt engineering techniques that can be used to improve LLMs' ability to distinguish among multiple sources of input. The key insight is to utilize transformations of an input to provide a reliable and continuous signal of its provenance. We evaluate spotlighting as a defense against indirect prompt injection attacks, and find that it is a robust defense that has minimal detrimental impact to underlying NLP tasks.

We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiamingzhang94/Adversarial-Prompt-Tuning.",

This work studies the adversarial robustness of VLMs from the novel perspective of the text prompt instead of the extensively studied model weights (frozen in this work). We first show that the effectiveness of both adversarial attack and defense are sensitive to the used text prompt. Inspired by this, we propose a method to improve resilience to adversarial attacks by learning a robust text prompt for VLMs. The proposed method, named Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered prompts and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution shift and across datasets. Surprisingly, by simply adding one learned word to the prompts, APT can significantly boost the accuracy and robustness (epsilon=4/255) over the hand-engineered prompts by +13% and +8.5% on average respectively. The improvement further increases, in our most effective setting, to +26.4% for accuracy and +16.7% for robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/APT.",

            "abstract": "With the boom of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research of solving Math Word Problem (MWP) has recently made great progress. However, there are few studies to examine the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. Instead of attacking prompts in the use of LLMs, we propose a MathAttack model to attack MWP samples which are closer to the essence of robustness in solving math problems. Compared to traditional text adversarial attack, it is essential to preserve the mathematical logic of original MWPs during the attacking. To this end, we propose logical entity recognition to identify logical entries which are then frozen. Subsequently, the remaining text are attacked by adopting a word-level attacker. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset RobustMath to evaluate the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. Extensive experiments on our RobustMath and two another math benchmark datasets GSM8K and MultiAirth show that MathAttack could effectively attack the math solving ability of LLMs. In the experiments, we observe that (1) Our adversarial samples from higher-accuracy LLMs are also effective for attacking LLMs with lower accuracy (e.g., transfer from larger to smaller-size LLMs, or from few-shot to zero-shot prompts); (2) Complex MWPs (such as more solving steps, longer text, more numbers) are more vulnerable to attack; (3) We can improve the robustness of LLMs by using our adversarial samples in few-shot prompts. Finally, we hope our practice and observation can serve as an important attempt towards enhancing the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability.

We implement these interventions as gradient-based adversarial attacks, which (in contrast to prior causal probing methodologies) are able to target arbitrarily-encoded representations of relational properties, and carry out a case study of this approach to analyze how BERT-like LMs use representations of several relational properties in performing associated relation prompting tasks. We find that, while the representations LMs leverage in performing each task are highly entangled, they may be meaningfully interpreted in terms of the tasks where they are most utilized; and more broadly, that CALM enables an expanded scope of inquiry in LM analysis that may be useful in predicting and explaining weaknesses of existing LMs.",

However, the task of understanding and interpreting their internal workings, in the context of adversarial attacks, remains largely unsolved. Gradient-based universal adversarial attacks have been shown to be highly effective on large language models and potentially dangerous due to their input-agnostic nature. This work presents a novel geometric perspective explaining universal adversarial attacks on large language models. By attacking the 117M parameter GPT-2 model, we find evidence indicating that universal adversarial triggers could be embedding vectors which merely approximate the semantic information in their adversarial training region. This hypothesis is supported by white-box model analysis comprising dimensionality reduction and similarity measurement of hidden representations. We believe this new geometric perspective on the underlying mechanism driving universal attacks could help us gain deeper insight into the internal workings and failure modes of LLMs, thus enabling their mitigation.",

Traditional defenses lean heavily on supervised detection techniques, which makes them vulnerable to issues arising from training data quality, inherent biases, noise, or adversarial inputs. This study observed common compromises in sentence fluency during aggression. On this basis, the Zero Sample Defender (ZDDR) is introduced for adversarial sample detection and recovery without relying on prior knowledge. ZDDR combines the log probability calculated by the model and the syntactic normative score of a large language model (LLM) to detect adversarial examples. Furthermore, using strategic prompts, ZDDR guides LLM in rephrasing adversarial content, maintaining clarity, structure, and meaning, thereby restoring the sentence from the attack. Benchmarking reveals a 9% improvement in area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for adversarial detection over existing techniques. Post-restoration, model classification efficacy surges by 45% compared to the offensive inputs, setting new performance standards against other restoration techniques.",

We experimentally evaluate the practical feasibility of prompt engineering on ChatGPT by assessing the performance of six common ML-based spam filters with emails modified by ChatG PT. From the experimental results, we show that adversarial prompt engineering decreases the performance of common ML-based spam filters, while NLP-based filter is robust to such modification.

However, while CLIP-based zero-shot classifiers have demonstrated competitive performance across a range of domain shifts, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Therefore, ensuring the robustness of such models is crucial for their reliable deployment in the wild. In this work, we introduce Open Vocabulary Certification (OVC), a fast certification method designed for open-vocabulary models like CLIP via randomized smoothing techniques. Given a base\"training\"set of prompts and their corresponding certified CLIP classifiers, OVC relies on the observation that a classifier with a novel prompt can be viewed as a perturbed version of nearby classifiers in the base training set. Therefore, OVC can rapidly certify the novel classifier using a variation of incremental randomized smoothing. By using a caching trick, we achieve approximately two orders of magnitude acceleration in the certification process for novel prompts. To achieve further (heuristic) speedups, OVC approximates the embedding space at a given input using a multivariate normal distribution bypassing the need for sampling via forward passes through the vision backbone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OVC on through experimental evaluation using multiple vision-language backbones on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet test datasets.",

            "abstract": "Text summarization (TS) plays a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) by automatically condensing and capturing key information from text documents. Its significance extends to diverse fields, including engineering, healthcare, and others, where it offers substantial time and resource savings. However, manual summarization is a laborious task, prompting the need for automated text summarization systems. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for extractive summarization that leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) word embedding. BERT, a transformer-based architecture, processes sentence bidirectionally, considering both preceding and following words. This contextual understanding empowers BERT to generate word representations that carry a deeper meaning and accurately reflect their usage within specific contexts. Our method adopts a generator and discriminator within the GAN framework. The generator assesses the likelihood of each sentence in the summary while the discriminator evaluates the generated summary. To extract meaningful features in parallel, we introduce three dilated convolution layers in the generator and discriminator. Dilated convolution allows for capturing a larger context and incorporating long-range dependencies. By introducing gaps between filter weights, dilated convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to consider a broader context of words. To encourage the generator to explore diverse sentence combinations that lead to high-quality summaries, we introduce various noises to each document within our proposed GAN. This approach allows the generator to learn from a range of sentence permutations and select the most suitable ones. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The results, measured using the ROUGE metric, demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to other tested methods. This confirms the effectiveness of our GAN-based strategy, which integrates dilated convolution layers, BERT word embedding, and a generator-discriminator framework in achieving enhanced extractive summarization performance.",
