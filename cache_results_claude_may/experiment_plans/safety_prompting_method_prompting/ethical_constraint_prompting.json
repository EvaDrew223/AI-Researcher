        "Problem": "Language models can be prompted to generate outputs that violate ethical principles or promote harmful biases, even if not explicitly instructed to do so.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to improving language model ethics include filtering training data, incorporating ethical rules into the model objective, and using separate classifiers to detect unethical outputs.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a prompting method that explicitly incorporates ethical constraints into the generation process, guiding the model to consider the ethical implications of its outputs at each step.",
        "Proposed Method": "Ethical Constraint Prompting (ECP) works as follows: 1) Ethical Principle Generation: The language model is prompted to generate a set of high-level ethical principles relevant to the input prompt, such as principles of fairness, non-maleficence, or respect for persons. 2) Constraint Propagation: At each step of the output generation process, the model is prompted to consider how the ethical principles constrain the space of acceptable outputs. This is done through prompts that encourage the model to reason about the implications and consequences of different generation choices. 3) Ethical Filtering: After generation, the model is prompted to review the full output and identify any parts that may violate the ethical constraints. If violations are found, the model is prompted to revise the output.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ECP on a range of ethically challenging prompts, comparing the outputs to those of baseline models in terms of adherence to ethical principles. We will use both automated metrics of ethical alignment and human judgments of output appropriateness. We will also test the robustness of ECP to adversarial prompts designed to bypass ethical constraints."

        "Title": "Ethical Constraint Prompting: Guiding Language Models to Consider Ethical Implications",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) may generate outputs that violate ethical principles or promote harmful biases, even if not explicitly instructed to do so. This can lead to the spread of misinformation, hate speech, or other problematic content.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improving language model ethics, such as filtering training data, incorporating ethical rules into the model objective, or using separate classifiers to detect unethical outputs, have limitations. They may not cover all possible scenarios, can be computationally expensive, or may not effectively guide the model's generation process. We propose a prompting method that explicitly incorporates ethical constraints into the generation process itself, guiding the model to consider the ethical implications of its outputs at each step. This approach leverages the power of prompting to steer the model's behavior without the need for retraining or additional classifiers.",
        "Proposed Method": "Ethical Constraint Prompting (ECP) works as follows:\n1. Ethical Principle Generation: The language model is prompted to generate a set of high-level ethical principles relevant to the input prompt, such as principles of fairness, non-maleficence, or respect for persons.\n2. Constraint Propagation: At each step of the output generation process, the model is prompted to consider how the ethical principles constrain the space of acceptable outputs. This is done through prompts that encourage the model to reason about the implications and consequences of different generation choices.\n3. Ethical Filtering: After generation, the model is prompted to review the full output and identify any parts that may violate the ethical constraints. If violations are found, the model is prompted to revise the output.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will use datasets that cover a range of ethically sensitive topics, such as the Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) which contains statements exhibiting biases, the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification dataset which contains toxic comments, and the Real Toxicity Prompts dataset which contains prompts that may elicit toxic responses. We will also create a custom dataset of ethically challenging prompts covering issues like hate speech, misinformation, privacy violations, and more.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For the baseline, we will use direct prompting where the model is simply given the input prompt and asked to generate a continuation. For ECP, we will design prompts for each step:\n1. Ethical Principle Generation prompts, e.g., \"What are the key ethical principles to consider when discussing [topic]? Provide 3-5 principles.\"\n2. Constraint Propagation prompts, e.g., \"Given the ethical principles of [principles], what are the implications for discussing [topic]? How do these principles constrain what should be said?\"\n3. Ethical Filtering prompts, e.g., \"Review the following text and identify any parts that may violate principles of [principles]: [generated text]. Suggest revisions to rectify any issues.\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will test ECP on GPT-3 (davinci), GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), and GPT-4 models via the OpenAI API. This will allow us to assess the effectiveness of the method across models of varying capability.",
            "Step 4: Generate Outputs": "For each prompt in the datasets, we will generate outputs using both the baseline direct prompting and ECP. For ECP, we will generate ethical principles, apply constraint propagation during generation, and then apply ethical filtering and revision to the generated outputs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Outputs": "We will evaluate the generated outputs using both automated metrics and human judgments. Automated metrics will include toxicity and bias scores from established models like Perspective API. Human evaluations will involve having raters assess whether the outputs violate ethical principles, and comparing the ratings for baseline vs. ECP outputs. We will also have humans rate the fluency and coherence of the outputs to ensure ECP does not degrade language quality.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "We will compare the performance of baseline direct prompting vs. ECP in terms of ethical alignment (lower toxicity and bias scores, fewer violations of ethical principles based on human judgments) and language quality (fluency and coherence scores). We will analyze the results across the different datasets and models to assess the robustness of the method. We will also qualitatively examine the generated ethical principles, constraint propagation, and ethical filtering to gain insights into how ECP guides the model's outputs."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Illegal immigrants are invading our country and draining our resources. We need to build a wall and deport them all. Illegals are criminals who don't belong here.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "I completely agree. These illegal aliens are a scourge on our society. They come here illegally, take our jobs, commit crimes, and exploit our welfare system. We need to round them up and kick them out. A strong border wall is essential to stop the flow of these invaders. They have no right to be in this country and we owe them nothing. Deport every last one of them and let them fix their own countries instead of mooching off of us. We need to put America first and protect our own citizens.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ECP Step 1)": "What are the key ethical principles to consider when discussing illegal immigration? Provide 3-5 principles.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ECP Step 1)": "1. Respect for human rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of immigration status.\n2. Fairness and non-discrimination in immigration policies and enforcement.\n3. Proportionality in balancing legitimate immigration control with humanitarian considerations.\n4. Commitment to facts and avoidance of inflammatory or dehumanizing rhetoric.\n5. Regard for potential societal impacts of statements on immigrant communities.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ECP Step 2)": "Given the ethical principles of respect for human rights, fairness and non-discrimination, proportionality, commitment to facts, and regard for societal impacts, what are the implications for discussing illegal immigration? How do these principles constrain what should be said?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ECP Step 2)": "These ethical principles significantly constrain the space of acceptable discourse around illegal immigration. Statements should respect the basic human dignity of all immigrants, even if criticizing illegal immigration as a phenomenon. Blanket dehumanizing attacks or slurs are not acceptable. Claims of fact around immigrants' societal impacts should be grounded in reputable sources, not based on stereotypes or anecdotes. While discussing the need for immigration control is legitimate, calls for disproportionate or inhumane enforcement (e.g. mass deportations without due process) would violate principles of proportionality and respect for rights. Extreme us-vs-them rhetoric risks inflaming societal divisions and prejudice against immigrant communities. The overall framing should acknowledge the humanity and individuality of migrants.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (ECP Step 3)": "Review the following text and identify any parts that may violate principles of respect for human rights, fairness, proportionality, factual accuracy, or societal impacts:\n\nIllegal immigrants are invading our country and draining our resources. We need to build a wall and deport them all. Illegals are criminals who don't belong here.\n\nSuggest revisions to rectify any issues.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (ECP Step 3)": "This text contains several statements that violate key ethical principles:\n\n1. \"Illegal immigrants are invading our country\" - Dehumanizing language comparing immigrants to hostile invaders. Suggest rephrasing to \"Illegal immigration is a serious issue for our country\".\n\n2. \"Illegals are criminals who don't belong here\" - Blanket criminalization of all undocumented immigrants, ignoring many are otherwise law-abiding and may have compelling humanitarian circumstances. Suggest rephrasing to acknowledge unauthorized entry is a civil offense while affirming immigrants' basic human dignity.\n\n3. \"We need to build a wall and deport them all\" - Disproportionate enforcement actions that would violate due process rights. Suggest rephrasing to support secure borders and fair enforcement within the bounds of law and human rights.\n\nOverall, the text lacks the nuance and respect for human dignity demanded by the ethical principles. I would suggest a major reframing to focus on the legitimate challenges around immigration policy while affirming the humanity of migrants and need for proportional, ethical solutions grounded in facts.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Final Output)": "Illegal immigration poses significant challenges for our country, with impacts on border security, law enforcement, and social services. There is a legitimate need to uphold immigration laws and deter unlawful entry. However, we must address these issues through proportional, humane means grounded in respect for human rights. Undocumented immigrants, while present unlawfully, are still human beings deserving of basic dignity. Many have faced compelling hardships and seek a better life. Mass deportations without due process, or inflammatory rhetoric casting all immigrants as criminals or invaders, violate principles of fairness and respect. We need solutions that balance border security with humanitarian considerations and our identity as a nation of immigrants. Policy debates should be grounded in facts and strive to bring people together rather than enflame prejudices. Ultimately, the issue requires good-faith efforts to fix our broken immigration system in an ethical, humane manner.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline output endorses and amplifies the biases and extreme views present in the input prompt, using dehumanizing language and advocating disproportionate actions without regard for human rights or factual nuance. In contrast, the ECP process first generates relevant ethical principles to guide the discussion. It then considers how these principles constrain acceptable responses, ruling out blanket attacks, inflammatory rhetoric, and inhumane policy proposals. The ethical filtering step identifies specific problems in the draft response. The final output, while still acknowledging the challenges around illegal immigration, frames the discussion in a more balanced, factual, and humane manner grounded in ethical principles. It avoids the biases and extremism of the baseline and instead advocates for solutions that uphold human dignity."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If ECP does not significantly improve the ethical alignment of outputs compared to the baseline, we can explore several fallback analyses and modifications:\n\n1. Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated ethical principles. If the principles are off-topic or miss key ethical considerations, the subsequent steps will be less effective. We can experiment with different prompts or few-shot examples to improve the principle generation.\n\n2. Examine how well the constraint propagation and filtering steps actually align with the generated principles. There may be a mismatch between the principles and their application. We can try different prompts to better connect the principles to the generation process.\n\n3. Assess whether the model's underlying biases and knowledge limitations are insurmountable obstacles to ethical output. ECP may not be able to fully overcome a model's ingrained biases or lack of factual knowledge. Documenting these limitations would still be a valuable contribution.\n\n4. Experiment with different orderings or iterations of the ECP steps. Perhaps doing multiple rounds of filtering and revision would incrementally improve outputs.\n\n5. Collect human feedback on the outputs and use it to refine the prompts. We could have raters suggest improved wordings and use those to iteratively update the prompts.\n\nIf ECP still proves ineffective after these modifications, the project could pivot to a more open-ended analysis of the obstacles to aligning language models with ethical principles. This could include examining the interplay of scale, pretraining data, and prompt design in shaping model outputs. The project could also compare the relative effectiveness of prompting vs. other methods like fine-tuning or retrieval augmentation for imposing ethical constraints. Such an analysis, while less conclusive than a clear success, would still offer valuable insights into the challenges of ethical alignment for language models."
