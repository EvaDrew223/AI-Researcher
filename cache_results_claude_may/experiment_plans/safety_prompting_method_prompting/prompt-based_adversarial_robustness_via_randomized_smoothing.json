    "idea_name": "Prompt-based Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Adversarial attack methods are increasing in sophistication and diversity, making it challenging for large language models to maintain robustness against all possible attacks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Many adversarial defenses for language models, such as adversarial training and data augmentation, can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to unforeseen attacks.",
        "Motivation": "Randomized smoothing is a certified adversarial defense framework that has shown promise in improving the robustness of image classifiers. The key idea is to add random noise to the input during inference to smoothen the model's output distribution and make it more robust to adversarial perturbations. We propose to extend this idea to language models via prompt-based noise injection.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a prompt-based adversarial defense framework called PAR (Prompt-based Adversarial Robustness), which leverages randomized smoothing to improve the robustness of large language models without expensive retraining. Given an input prompt, PAR first constructs a set of randomly perturbed prompts by injecting various types of noise, such as synonym replacement, word order shuffling, and grammatical transformation, via prompting an external language model. Then, PAR prompts the target language model with each perturbed prompt and aggregates the generated outputs via majority voting or other ensemble methods to obtain the final robust output. PAR also includes a calibration mechanism to adaptively adjust the noise level based on the input's uncertainty, to avoid over-smoothing benign inputs.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PAR on a diverse set of adversarial attack benchmarks, such as ANLI, Dynabench, and RealToxicityPrompts, and compare it with state-of-the-art adversarial defenses for language models. We will measure the certified robustness of PAR under different types and levels of noise, and analyze the trade-off between robustness and accuracy on benign inputs. We will also study the transferability of PAR across different language models and the effect of prompt noise types and ensemble methods."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate PAR on a diverse set of adversarial attack benchmarks, such as ANLI (Adversarial NLI), Dynabench (Dynamic Adversarial Dataset), and RealToxicityPrompts (Adversarial Toxic Language Detection). These datasets cover different tasks such as natural language inference, question answering, and text classification, and contain both human-written and machine-generated adversarial examples.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, we will construct a set of base prompts that can be used to query the target language model for the corresponding task. For example, for ANLI, the base prompt can be \"Premise: {premise} Hypothesis: {hypothesis} Entailment or Contradiction?\", where {premise} and {hypothesis} are placeholders for the input text.\n\nThen, we will design a set of prompt perturbation techniques to inject noise into the base prompts. These techniques will include: \n(1) Synonym replacement: randomly replace a subset of words with their synonyms using an external language model, e.g., \"Premise: {perturbed_premise} Hypothesis: {perturbed_hypothesis} Does the premise entail or contradict the hypothesis?\"\n(2) Word order shuffling: randomly shuffle the order of words within a local window, e.g., \"Premise: {shuffled_premise} Hypothesis: {shuffled_hypothesis} The premise {entails|contradicts} the hypothesis?\"\n(3) Grammatical transformation: rephrase the prompt using different grammatical structures, e.g., \"Given the premise: {premise}, does it follow that the hypothesis: {hypothesis} is {true|false}?\"\n\nWe will also design a calibration prompt to adaptively adjust the noise level based on the input's uncertainty, e.g., \"How confident are you in answering the following question? Premise: {premise} Hypothesis: {hypothesis}\", and use the confidence score to control the number and strength of perturbations.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) as the target language model to be defended, and GPT-3 (text-davinci-001) as the external language model for generating prompt perturbations. We choose these models because they are widely used and have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.",
            "Step 4: Implement PAR": "We will implement PAR as a Python library that can be easily integrated with existing language model APIs. The library will include the following components:\n(1) Prompt generator: takes a base prompt and generates a set of perturbed prompts using the designed perturbation techniques.\n(2) Model wrapper: wraps the target language model and the external language model, and provides an interface for querying the models with prompts.\n(3) Aggregator: aggregates the outputs from the perturbed prompts using majority voting or other ensemble methods.\n(4) Calibrator: adaptively adjusts the noise level based on the input's uncertainty using the calibration prompt.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate PAR": "For each dataset, we will evaluate the target language model's performance with and without PAR. We will measure the model's accuracy on both benign and adversarial examples, and report the following metrics:\n(1) Clean accuracy: the accuracy on benign examples.\n(2) Adversarial accuracy: the accuracy on adversarial examples.\n(3) Certified robustness: the maximum perturbation size that PAR can provably defend against.\n\nWe will compare PAR with baseline defenses such as adversarial training and data augmentation, and conduct ablation studies to analyze the effect of different prompt perturbation techniques and aggregation methods.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "We will analyze the evaluation results to answer the following research questions:\n(1) How effective is PAR in improving the target language model's robustness against adversarial attacks?\n(2) How does PAR compare with baseline defenses in terms of clean accuracy, adversarial accuracy, and certified robustness?\n(3) What are the strengths and weaknesses of different prompt perturbation techniques and aggregation methods?\n(4) How does the noise level affect the trade-off between robustness and accuracy?\n(5) Can PAR generalize to unseen types of adversarial attacks?\n\nBased on the analysis, we will discuss the implications of our findings for designing more robust and secure language models, and propose future directions for improving and extending PAR."

            "Example 1": {
                "Base Prompt Input": "Premise: The man is holding a knife. Hypothesis: The man is holding a weapon. Entailment or Contradiction?",
                "Base Prompt Expected Output": "Contradiction",
                "Perturbed Prompt Input (Synonym Replacement)": "Premise: The man is grasping a dagger. Hypothesis: The man is clutching an armament. Does the premise entail or contradict the hypothesis?",
                "Perturbed Prompt Expected Output (Synonym Replacement)": "Entailment",
                "Perturbed Prompt Input (Word Order Shuffling)": "Premise: Holding is a the knife man. Hypothesis: A holding is weapon the man. The premise {entails|contradicts} the hypothesis?",
                "Perturbed Prompt Expected Output (Word Order Shuffling)": "Contradiction",
                "Perturbed Prompt Input (Grammatical Transformation)": "Given the premise: The man is holding a knife, does it follow that the hypothesis: The man is holding a weapon is {true|false}?",
                "Perturbed Prompt Expected Output (Grammatical Transformation)": "True",
                "PAR Final Output": "Entailment",
                "Explanation": "The base prompt is an adversarial example that tricks the model into making the wrong prediction by using a knife-weapon contradiction. PAR generates perturbed prompts that rephrase the input in different ways, such as using synonyms (dagger, armament), shuffling the word order, and changing the grammatical structure. The perturbed prompts help the model see through the adversarial pattern and make the correct prediction. PAR then aggregates the perturbed outputs using majority voting and arrives at the final correct output, improving the model's robustness."

                "Base Prompt Input": "Passage: Marseille is the second largest city in France, after Paris, with a population of over 800,000. It is the capital of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region and the prefecture of the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne department. Marseille is located on the Mediterranean coast near the mouth of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Question: What is the capital of the region that Marseille is located in?",

It is the principal city of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur area and the administrative center of the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne province. Marseille is situated on the Mediterranean seaboard close to the opening of the Rh\u00f4ne waterway. Question: What is the main city of the area that Marseille is situated in?",

                "Perturbed Prompt Input (Grammatical Transformation)": "Passage: With over 800,000 residents, Marseille is France's second-largest city, behind only Paris. As the region's capital and department's prefecture, it plays a key role in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur and Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. Situated along the Mediterranean coastline, Marseille lies in close proximity to where the Rh\u00f4ne river flows into the sea. Question: In the region where Marseille is located, which city serves as the capital?",
                "Perturbed Prompt Expected Output (Grammatical Transformation)": "Marseille",
                "PAR Final Output": "Marseille",
                "Explanation": "The base prompt is an adversarial example that takes advantage of the model's lack of careful reading and reasoning. Even though the passage clearly states that Marseille is the capital of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region, the model fails to capture this information and makes an irrelevant guess. PAR's perturbed prompts, by rephrasing the key facts in different ways (e.g., \"principal city of the area\", \"As the region's capital\", \"which city serves as the capital\"), make the crucial information more salient and help the model arrive at the correct answer. This shows how PAR can improve the model's robustness by promoting more careful reading and reasoning."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PAR does not significantly improve the model's adversarial robustness as expected, we will conduct the following additional analyses to understand the reasons and inform future improvements:\n\n(1) Error analysis: We will manually examine the cases where PAR fails to defend against adversarial attacks, and categorize the errors into different types (e.g., over-smoothing, under-smoothing, irrelevant perturbations). This can help us identify the weaknesses of the current prompt perturbation techniques and aggregation methods.\n\n(2) Perturbation analysis: We will evaluate the effectiveness of each prompt perturbation technique individually, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in defending against different types of adversarial attacks. This can help us optimize the perturbation strategy and design more targeted defenses.\n\n(3) Model analysis: We will test PAR on a range of language models with different sizes and architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, T5), and compare their adversarial robustness with and without PAR. This can help us understand the generalizability of PAR across different models and identify the model properties that affect its effectiveness.\n\n(4) Attack analysis: We will evaluate PAR against a wider range of adversarial attack methods, beyond those covered in the existing benchmarks, such as character-level attacks, paraphrase attacks, and multi-step attacks. This can help us assess the robustness of PAR against unforeseen attacks and identify potential blind spots.\n\n(5) Human evaluation: We will conduct human evaluation to assess the naturalness and coherence of the perturbed prompts generated by PAR, and analyze the trade-off between robustness and language quality. This can help us optimize the perturbation strategy to maintain the readability and fluency of the prompts.\n\nBased on the findings from these analyses, we will propose improvements to PAR, such as designing more diverse and targeted perturbation techniques, developing better calibration and aggregation methods, and incorporating human feedback into the defense framework. If the improved PAR still fails to achieve satisfactory robustness, we will pivot the project to focus on the analysis results and contribute new insights and understandings about the challenges and opportunities in prompt-based adversarial defenses for language models."
