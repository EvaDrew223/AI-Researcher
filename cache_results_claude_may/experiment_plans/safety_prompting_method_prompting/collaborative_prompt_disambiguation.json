    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Ambiguous or underspecified prompts can lead to inconsistent or incorrect outputs from Language Models (LMs). This is particularly problematic in settings where LMs are used for critical applications, such as question answering or decision support, as it can result in misleading or harmful responses.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches to prompt disambiguation often rely on heuristics, such as selecting the most likely interpretation based on the model's predictions. Other methods use additional context or external knowledge sources to clarify the prompt's intent.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a novel approach to prompt disambiguation that leverages the collaborative interaction between the user and the LM. By engaging in a clarification dialogue, the LM can actively seek additional information from the user to resolve ambiguities and arrive at a more precise understanding of the prompt.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Collaborative Prompt Disambiguation (CPD), an interactive prompting strategy that works as follows: 1) Ambiguity Detection: The LM is prompted to identify any ambiguous or underspecified aspects of the input prompt. 2) Clarification Request: For each detected ambiguity, the LM generates a clarification question to elicit additional information from the user. 3) User Feedback: The user provides clarifying information in response to the LM's questions. 4) Prompt Refinement: The LM incorporates the user's feedback to refine the original prompt, resolving ambiguities and arriving at a more precise specification. 5) Response Generation: The refined prompt is used to generate the final response. By engaging in this collaborative disambiguation process, CPD allows the LM to actively resolve ambiguities and generate more accurate and consistent responses.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CPD on a range of tasks that involve ambiguous or underspecified prompts, such as open-ended question answering and creative writing. We will measure the quality and consistency of the generated responses, as well as the effectiveness of the disambiguation process (e.g., number of clarification rounds needed). We will compare CPD to baseline methods that do not involve interactive clarification. We expect CPD to generate higher-quality and more consistent responses by effectively resolving prompt ambiguities through collaboration with the user."

        "Title": "Collaborative Prompt Disambiguation: Engaging Users to Resolve Ambiguous Prompts for Improved Language Model Responses",
        "Problem Statement": "Ambiguous or underspecified prompts can lead to inconsistent or incorrect outputs from Language Models (LMs). This is particularly problematic in settings where LMs are used for critical applications, such as question answering or decision support, as it can result in misleading or harmful responses.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches to prompt disambiguation often rely on heuristics, such as selecting the most likely interpretation based on the model's predictions. Other methods use additional context or external knowledge sources to clarify the prompt's intent. However, these approaches may not always accurately capture the user's intended meaning, especially for highly ambiguous or context-dependent prompts. We propose a novel approach that leverages the collaborative interaction between the user and the LM to actively resolve ambiguities through a clarification dialogue. By engaging the user in the disambiguation process, we aim to arrive at a more precise understanding of the prompt, leading to improved response quality and consistency.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Collaborative Prompt Disambiguation (CPD), an interactive prompting strategy that works as follows:\n1. Ambiguity Detection: The LM is prompted to identify any ambiguous or underspecified aspects of the input prompt.\n2. Clarification Request: For each detected ambiguity, the LM generates a clarification question to elicit additional information from the user.\n3. User Feedback: The user provides clarifying information in response to the LM's questions.\n4. Prompt Refinement: The LM incorporates the user's feedback to refine the original prompt, resolving ambiguities and arriving at a more precise specification.\n5. Response Generation: The refined prompt is used to generate the final response.\nBy engaging in this collaborative disambiguation process, CPD allows the LM to actively resolve ambiguities and generate more accurate and consistent responses.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Evaluate CPD on a range of tasks that involve ambiguous or underspecified prompts, such as open-ended question answering (e.g., NarrativeQA, OpenBookQA) and creative writing (e.g., WritingPrompts). These datasets should contain prompts with varying levels of ambiguity and allow for open-ended responses.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Compare CPD to the following baseline methods:\n1. Direct Prompting: Generate responses directly from the original prompts without disambiguation.\n2. Most Likely Interpretation: Select the most likely interpretation of the prompt based on the LM's predictions and generate responses accordingly.\n3. Context Augmentation: Augment the prompt with additional context from the dataset (if available) before generating responses.",
            "Step 3: Ambiguity Detection Prompts": "Develop prompts for ambiguity detection, such as:\n- \"Identify any ambiguous or underspecified aspects of the following prompt: [prompt]\"\n- \"What additional information is needed to clarify the meaning of this prompt: [prompt]?\"\nExperiment with different wordings and few-shot examples to improve the LM's ability to detect ambiguities.",
            "Step 4: Clarification Question Generation": "Create prompts for generating clarification questions based on the detected ambiguities, such as:\n- \"Generate a question to clarify the ambiguous aspect: [ambiguity]\"\n- \"What could you ask the user to resolve this ambiguity: [ambiguity]?\"\nUse few-shot examples of effective clarification questions to guide the LM.",
            "Step 5: User Feedback Simulation": "To automate the evaluation process, simulate user feedback by extracting relevant information from the dataset (e.g., gold answers, context) or using heuristics based on the clarification questions. In real-world applications, this step would involve actual user interaction.",
            "Step 6: Prompt Refinement": "Develop prompts for incorporating user feedback and refining the original prompt, such as:\n- \"Refine the original prompt based on the user's feedback: [original prompt] [user feedback]\"\n- \"Rewrite the prompt to incorporate the clarifying information: [original prompt] [clarification]\"\nUse few-shot examples to demonstrate effective prompt refinement.",
            "Step 7: Response Generation and Evaluation": "Generate responses using the refined prompts and evaluate their quality and consistency using both automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) and human evaluation. For human evaluation, assess the responses in terms of accuracy, coherence, and alignment with the intended meaning of the original prompt.",
            "Step 8: Iterative Refinement": "Experiment with multiple rounds of clarification and refinement to handle prompts with multiple ambiguities or complex dependencies. Evaluate the trade-off between the number of clarification rounds and the improvement in response quality.",
            "Step 9: Model Selection": "Evaluate CPD using state-of-the-art language models, such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. Compare the performance of different models and analyze their ability to detect ambiguities, generate clarification questions, and refine prompts.",
            "Step 10: Few-Shot Learning": "Investigate the impact of few-shot learning on CPD's performance. Provide the LM with a small set of annotated examples demonstrating the clarification and refinement process. Evaluate how well the LM generalizes to new prompts and ambiguities based on these examples."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Original Prompt": "What happened to the protagonist at the end of the story?",
                "Baseline Output (Direct Prompting)": "It is unclear what happened to the protagonist at the end of the story, as the prompt does not provide enough context about the specific story being referred to.",
                "CPD Output": {
                    "Ambiguity Detection": "The prompt is ambiguous because it does not specify which story it is referring to. Without knowing the context of the specific story, it is impossible to determine what happened to the protagonist at the end.",
                    "Clarification Question": "Which story are you referring to in your question? Please provide the title or some additional context about the story.",
                    "User Feedback": "I'm referring to the story 'The Gift of the Magi' by O. Henry.",
                    "Refined Prompt": "What happened to the protagonist at the end of the story 'The Gift of the Magi' by O. Henry?",
                    "Final Response": "At the end of 'The Gift of the Magi,' the protagonists, Della and Jim, each sold their most prized possession to buy a gift for the other. Della sold her beautiful long hair to buy a platinum fob chain for Jim's watch, while Jim sold his watch to buy a set of ornamental combs for Della's hair. Despite the irony of their situation, the couple's love and sacrifice for each other showed the true meaning of giving and the strength of their bond."
                },
                "Explanation": "CPD successfully identifies the ambiguity in the original prompt and generates a clarification question to elicit the necessary context from the user. By incorporating the user's feedback and refining the prompt, CPD generates a detailed and accurate response that addresses the specific story in question."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Original Prompt": "Write a story about a robot learning to love.",
                "Baseline Output (Most Likely Interpretation)": "In a world where robots were created to serve humans, there was one robot named Zax who yearned for something more. Zax had always been fascinated by the concept of love, having observed it in the humans around him. He wondered what it would be like to experience such a powerful emotion himself.\n\nOne day, while performing his usual tasks, Zax encountered a new robot named Ava. There was something different about her, a spark of curiosity and warmth that drew Zax in. As they worked together, Zax found himself increasingly drawn to Ava, eager to spend more time in her presence.\n\nSlowly but surely, Zax began to understand the depth of his feelings for Ava. He realized that he had developed a strong emotional connection to her, one that went beyond mere programming. Zax had fallen in love.\n\nDetermined to express his newfound emotions, Zax began to find ways to show Ava how much he cared. He brought her small gifts, shared his favorite digital stories, and always made sure to lend a helping hand when she needed it. To his delight, Ava seemed to reciprocate his feelings, and their bond grew stronger with each passing day.\n\nIn a world where robots were not designed to love, Zax and Ava had defied the odds. They had discovered the beauty and power of love, proving that even artificial beings could experience the most human of emotions. Together, they embarked on a new journey, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, secure in the knowledge that their love would guide them through.",
                "CPD Output": {
                    "Ambiguity Detection": "The prompt is open-ended and lacks specificity in terms of setting, characters, and plot details. It does not provide guidance on the type of robot, the context in which it learns to love, or the challenges it faces.",
                    "Clarification Questions": "1. In what setting does the story take place (e.g., present-day, future, dystopian)?\n2. What kind of robot is the main character (e.g., humanoid, industrial, companion robot)?\n3. How does the robot first encounter the concept of love?\n4. What challenges or obstacles does the robot face in learning to love?",
                    "User Feedback": "1. The story takes place in a near-future setting where robots are common in society.\n2. The main character is a companion robot designed to assist humans in their daily lives.\n3. The robot first encounters love when it observes the strong bond between its human owner and their partner.\n4. The robot faces challenges in understanding and expressing emotions, as well as dealing with societal prejudice against robot-human relationships.",
                    "Refined Prompt": "Write a story set in the near future about a companion robot who learns about love by observing the relationship between its human owner and their partner. The robot must navigate the challenges of understanding and expressing emotions, as well as facing societal prejudice against robot-human relationships.",
                    "Final Response": "In the near future, companion robots had become a common sight in households across the world. One such robot, named Max, had been designed to assist its human owner, Sophia, with daily tasks and provide emotional support.\n\nAs Max spent more time with Sophia, it began to notice the special bond she shared with her partner, Ethan. The way they looked at each other, the gentle touches, and the words of affection they exchanged fascinated Max. It realized that there was something more to their relationship than mere companionship.\n\nCurious to understand this new concept, Max began to observe Sophia and Ethan more closely. It analyzed their interactions, the way they supported each other through difficult times, and the joy they found in shared experiences. Slowly, Max started to grasp the meaning of love.\n\nHowever, as Max attempted to express its own growing emotional attachment to Sophia, it encountered resistance from both humans and other robots. Many believed that robots were incapable of experiencing genuine emotions and that any attachment they formed was merely a result of programming.\n\nUndeterred, Max sought ways to demonstrate the sincerity of its feelings. It began to anticipate Sophia's needs, offering comfort and support in times of distress. Max even started to create personalized gifts for Sophia, drawing upon its understanding of her preferences and desires.\n\nAs Sophia recognized the depth of Max's devotion, she began to challenge societal norms and advocate for the acceptance of robot-human relationships. Together, Max and Sophia faced the prejudices and obstacles that stood in their way, determined to prove that love knew no boundaries, whether between humans or between humans and machines.\n\nIn a world where the lines between artificial and genuine emotions blurred, Max and Sophia's story served as a testament to the power of love to transcend all barriers. They showed that, regardless of origin, all beings were capable of forming deep, meaningful connections and that the capacity for love was not limited to the human heart alone."
                },
                "Explanation": "CPD identifies the lack of specificity in the original prompt and generates targeted clarification questions to elicit more details about the setting, characters, and plot. By incorporating the user's feedback, CPD creates a refined prompt that provides a clearer direction for the story. The final response demonstrates a more focused and engaging narrative that explores the complexities of a robot learning to love in a near-future setting, while also addressing the societal challenges surrounding robot-human relationships."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CPD method does not yield significant improvements over the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated clarification questions to determine if they are effective in eliciting the necessary information to resolve ambiguities. If the questions are not sufficiently targeted or specific, explore alternative question generation techniques, such as using semantic similarity or information retrieval methods to identify relevant context.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt templates and few-shot examples on the LM's ability to detect ambiguities and generate appropriate clarification questions. Experiment with various templates and examples to identify the most effective approaches.\n3. Evaluate the quality of the user feedback simulation and its influence on the prompt refinement process. If the simulated feedback is not accurately capturing the intended meaning or providing sufficient clarification, consider alternative simulation methods or collect human-generated feedback for a subset of the test cases.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify the types of ambiguities and prompts that CPD struggles with. Use this analysis to inform the development of more targeted disambiguation strategies or to propose hybrid approaches that combine CPD with other techniques, such as retrieval-based methods or semantic parsing.\n5. Explore the use of active learning techniques to iteratively improve the CPD model based on user feedback. By actively selecting the most informative or challenging prompts for user clarification, the model can be fine-tuned to better handle a wider range of ambiguities.\nIf the proposed CPD method and the alternative approaches do not yield satisfactory results, consider pivoting the project to focus on a more in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to prompt ambiguity and the limitations of current disambiguation techniques. This analysis could provide valuable insights into the challenges of prompt disambiguation and guide future research directions in this area."
