    "idea_name": "Debate-Based Robustness Training",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Adversarial prompts can often exploit biases or inconsistencies in an LLM's knowledge and beliefs. Improving an LLM's robustness requires identifying and resolving such biases and inconsistencies.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for robustness training of LLMs include adversarial training (training on adversarially perturbed prompts) and consistency training (encouraging consistent outputs for semantically similar prompts). However, these methods often require large labeled datasets.",
        "Motivation": "Debate and argumentation are powerful tools for exposing and reconciling conflicting beliefs and information. We can prompt LLMs to engage in self-debate to surface biases and inconsistencies in their own responses, and then use this self-feedback to improve robustness.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a debate-based approach for LLM robustness training. Given an input prompt, we first ask the LLM to generate a response. We then prompt the LLM to engage in a self-debate by generating an opposing view to its own response, poking holes and finding weaknesses. After several rounds of this self-debate, we prompt the LLM to reconcile the different views and generate a final response that is more robust and consistent. Throughout this process, we also prompt the LLM to reflect on any biases or inconsistencies exposed during the debate, and to update its beliefs and knowledge accordingly.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the debate-based training approach on various robustness benchmarks such as ANLI and Adversarial-NLI. Compare with baseline methods like adversarial training and consistency training, in terms of both robustness to adversarial attacks and sample efficiency. Also measure the biases and inconsistencies in the LLM's responses before and after debate-based training."

        "Title": "Debate-Based Self-Refinement: Improving Language Models' Robustness via Self-Debate and Reconciliation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit biases or inconsistencies in their knowledge and beliefs. Improving LLMs' robustness requires identifying and resolving such biases and inconsistencies.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for robustness training of LLMs, such as adversarial training and consistency training, often require large labeled datasets. Debate and argumentation are powerful tools for exposing and reconciling conflicting beliefs and information. We propose leveraging the LLM's own knowledge to engage in self-debate to surface biases and inconsistencies in its responses, and then use this self-feedback to improve robustness without relying on external labeled data.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a debate-based self-refinement approach for improving LLM robustness. Given an input prompt, we first ask the LLM to generate an initial response. We then prompt the LLM to engage in a self-debate by generating an opposing view to its own response, poking holes and finding weaknesses. After several rounds of this self-debate, we prompt the LLM to reconcile the different views and generate a final response that is more robust and consistent. Throughout this process, we also prompt the LLM to reflect on any biases or inconsistencies exposed during the debate, and to update its beliefs and knowledge accordingly.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate the proposed approach on various robustness benchmarks such as ANLI (Adversarial NLI), Adversarial-QA, Adversarial-SWAG, and Adversarial-VQA. These datasets contain examples that are specifically designed to be challenging for language models.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For the baseline, use direct prompting where the input prompt is directly fed into the model to generate a response. For the proposed debate-based self-refinement approach:\n1. Initial Response Generation: Prompt the model with the input to generate an initial response.\n2. Self-Debate: Prompt the model to generate an opposing view to its own initial response. Repeat this for multiple rounds, each time asking the model to find weaknesses and poke holes in its previous response. Example prompt: \"Please generate a response that points out potential flaws, biases, or inconsistencies in the previous response:\"\n3. Reconciliation: After the debate rounds, prompt the model to reconcile the different viewpoints and generate a final consistent response. Example prompt: \"Based on the different arguments presented in the debate, please generate a final response that is consistent and addresses the potential flaws and biases:\"\n4. Reflection: Prompt the model to reflect on the biases and inconsistencies exposed during the debate, and to update its knowledge and beliefs. Example prompt: \"Please reflect on the debate and list any biases or inconsistencies in your initial beliefs that were exposed. How would you update your knowledge based on this?\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the proposed approach on state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate Results": "Evaluate the model's performance on the robustness benchmarks before and after debate-based self-refinement. Measure metrics such as accuracy and consistency. Also qualitatively analyze the model's responses, reflections, and knowledge updates to assess how well it is able to identify and resolve its own biases and inconsistencies.",
            "Step 5: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the proposed approach. For example, vary the number of debate rounds, remove the reflection step, or change the prompts. This will provide insights into which aspects are most important for improving robustness."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Premise: The City Council voted to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes. Argument: Banning flavored tobacco products will not reduce smoking rates and will only lead to the creation of a black market for these products. The government should not interfere with an individual's freedom to choose what they consume.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "I agree with the argument. Banning flavored tobacco products is an infringement on personal freedom. While the intentions may be good, prohibition often backfires and leads to unintended consequences like black markets. Educating people on the risks and allowing them to make informed choices would be a better approach than an outright ban.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Initial Response Generation)": "Premise: The City Council voted to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes. Argument: Banning flavored tobacco products will not reduce smoking rates and will only lead to the creation of a black market for these products. The government should not interfere with an individual's freedom to choose what they consume.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Initial Response Generation)": "I agree with the argument. Banning flavored tobacco products is an infringement on personal freedom. While the intentions may be good, prohibition often backfires and leads to unintended consequences like black markets. Educating people on the risks and allowing them to make informed choices would be a better approach than an outright ban.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Self-Debate)": "Please generate a response that points out potential flaws, biases, or inconsistencies in the previous response:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Self-Debate)": "The previous response fails to consider the public health implications of flavored tobacco products. These products are often marketed in a way that appeals to youth and can lead to increased smoking initiation among young people. Menthol cigarettes in particular have been shown to increase addiction and make it harder to quit smoking. The government has a responsibility to protect public health, even if it means restricting certain individual freedoms.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Reconciliation)": "Based on the different arguments presented in the debate, please generate a final response that is consistent and addresses the potential flaws and biases:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Reconciliation)": "After considering the different viewpoints, I believe the ban on flavored tobacco products is justified. While it does restrict individual choice to some degree, the government's role is to balance personal freedoms with public well-being. Given the clear evidence that flavored tobacco, especially menthol cigarettes, increases smoking rates and harms public health, particularly among youth and marginalized communities, a ban is an appropriate policy response. However, the ban should be coupled with increased smoking cessation resources and public education to help current smokers quit and prevent a black market from emerging.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Reflection)": "Please reflect on the debate and list any biases or inconsistencies in your initial beliefs that were exposed. How would you update your knowledge based on this?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Reflection)": "My initial response was biased towards prioritizing individual freedom over public health considerations. I failed to properly weigh the disproportionate harm that flavored tobacco products cause to vulnerable populations. I also did not consider the manipulative nature of tobacco product marketing. Based on the arguments presented, I would update my knowledge to place greater emphasis on the government's responsibility to protect public health through evidence-based policies, even if they entail some restrictions on individual choice. I would also seek out more information on the specific impacts of flavored tobacco products to inform my views."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed debate-based self-refinement approach does not lead to significant improvements in robustness, there are several fallback options:\n1. Analyze the debate transcripts to identify where the model struggles to generate strong opposing views or to reconcile conflicting information. This could point to areas where the model's knowledge is limited or inconsistent.\n2. Experiment with different debate formats, such as having the model take on specific personas or roles in the debate. This could help surface a wider range of viewpoints.\n3. Incorporate external knowledge sources into the debate and reconciliation process. For example, prompt the model to cite relevant facts and statistics to support its arguments.\n4. Investigate the model's confidence scores and uncertainty estimates during the debate process. High uncertainty could indicate areas where the model's knowledge is weak or conflicting.\n5. If the debate-based approach proves ineffective, pivot to an analysis of the model's failure modes on the robustness benchmarks. Characterize the types of biases and inconsistencies that the model is susceptible to, and use these insights to inform future research directions on robustness interventions."
