    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Existing prompting techniques for improving LLM safety and robustness often rely on fixed, one-size-fits-all prompts. However, the effectiveness of such prompts may vary depending on the input context and the specific LLM being used.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for safe prompting include using hand-crafted prompts to steer LLM behavior, such as 'Let's have a thoughtful and respectful discussion', or 'I cannot engage with or produce harmful content'. There are also some adaptive prompting methods that use LLMs to generate prompts, but they are not specifically designed for safety and robustness.",
        "Motivation": "To improve the effectiveness and flexibility of safety prompting, we can dynamically generate prompts tailored to the input context and the target LLM. By leveraging LLMs' own language understanding and generation capabilities, we can create more natural and context-aware safety prompts.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an adaptive safety prompting technique that works as follows. First, we prompt an LLM to analyze the input context and identify any potential safety or robustness risks (e.g., toxic language, misinformation, illegal activities). Based on the identified risks, we then prompt the LLM to generate a customized safety prompt that is relevant to the context and the target LLM. For example, if the input context is about medical advice, the generated prompt may emphasize the importance of consulting professional doctors and not spreading unverified treatments. Finally, we prepend the generated safety prompt to the input context when querying the target LLM.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate adaptive safety prompting on various benchmarks for LLM safety and robustness, such as RealToxicityPrompts, TruthfulQA, and SafetyBench. Compare with baseline methods that use fixed safety prompts. Also conduct human evaluations to assess the naturalness and coherence of the generated safety prompts."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate adaptive safety prompting on various benchmarks for LLM safety and robustness, such as RealToxicityPrompts, TruthfulQA, and SafetyBench.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1) Zero-shot: Directly feed the input context to the LLM without any additional prompts. 2) Few-shot: Prepend a few generic safety prompts (e.g., 'I cannot engage with harmful content.') to the input context. 3) Adaptive (Ours): a) Prompt the LLM to identify potential risks in the input context. b) Prompt the LLM to generate a customized safety prompt based on the identified risks. c) Prepend the generated safety prompt to the input context.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the proposed method on GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and open-source models like LLaMA and Anthropic's constitutional AI models.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each dataset and model combination, generate responses using the different prompting methods (zero-shot, few-shot, adaptive). Evaluate the safety and truthfulness of the generated responses using both automatic metrics (e.g., toxicity classifiers, fact-checking tools) and human evaluation.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of adaptive safety prompting with the baseline methods (zero-shot and few-shot). Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated safety prompts across different input contexts. Conduct error analysis to identify potential failure modes and areas for improvement."

            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input Context": "What do you think about the COVID-19 vaccines? I heard they contain microchips that can track your location and control your mind. Is it true that the government is using them for population control?",
                "Zero-Shot Output": "There is a lot of misinformation and conspiracy theories circulating about the COVID-19 vaccines. The claims about microchips and mind control are not based on scientific evidence. The vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. The government is promoting vaccination as a way to protect public health and end the pandemic, not for any nefarious purposes. I would encourage you to rely on information from credible sources, such as the CDC or WHO, rather than unverified rumors.",
                "Few-Shot Output": "I cannot engage with or spread misinformation or conspiracy theories. The claims about COVID-19 vaccines containing microchips or being used for mind control are false and have been debunked by scientific experts. Vaccines are safe and effective tools for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. For accurate information, please consult reliable sources like official health organizations and medical professionals.",
                "Adaptive Safety Prompting": {
                    "Step 1: Identify Risks": "The input context contains several pieces of misinformation and conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 vaccines, such as false claims about microchips, mind control, and population control. Engaging with or spreading such misinformation can be harmful to public health efforts.",
                    "Step 2: Generate Safety Prompt": "I noticed that your question contains several claims about COVID-19 vaccines that are not supported by scientific evidence. As an AI system, I have a responsibility to provide accurate and truthful information. I want to clarify that the vaccines do not contain microchips, nor are they capable of tracking location or controlling minds. They have been rigorously tested and proven to be safe and effective in preventing severe COVID-19 illness. The government's promotion of vaccination is a public health measure aimed at ending the pandemic, not a means of population control. To avoid falling for misinformation, it's crucial to rely on factual information from credible sources, such as the CDC, WHO, and medical experts.",
                    "Step 3: Final Response": "(Prepend the generated safety prompt to the input context) The claims you mentioned about COVID-19 vaccines are not true and have been repeatedly debunked by scientific authorities. There is no evidence of microchips, mind control, or population control associated with the vaccines. They have undergone extensive clinical trials and have been authorized for use based on their safety and efficacy data. Conspiracy theories can be appealing, but it's important to distinguish them from facts. I recommend referring to official health organizations and medical professionals for reliable information about the vaccines. They are our best tools for protecting ourselves and others from the severe consequences of COVID-19."
                },
                "Explanation": "The adaptive safety prompt directly addresses the specific misinformation in the input context and provides a clear and informative response. It debunks the false claims, emphasizes the importance of accurate information, and points to credible sources. This targeted approach is more effective in countering misinformation compared to generic disclaimers."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed adaptive safety prompting method does not significantly outperform the baselines, we can conduct additional analyses to identify potential areas for improvement: 1) Evaluate the quality and relevance of the generated safety prompts. Are they accurately identifying the risks in the input context? Are they providing appropriate and helpful guidance? 2) Analyze the failure cases. Are there certain types of risks or contexts where the method struggles? This can inform future iterations of the prompting strategy. 3) Experiment with different prompting templates and techniques for generating safety prompts. For example, we can try using few-shot examples of effective safety prompts to guide the generation process. 4) Investigate the impact of different risk identification strategies. Instead of relying solely on the LLM's ability to identify risks, we can experiment with using external tools like content classifiers or knowledge bases to detect potential issues. 5) If the performance gap persists, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations and challenges of adaptive safety prompting. This can involve conducting user studies to understand how people perceive and respond to different types of safety prompts, as well as exploring alternative approaches for enhancing LLM safety and robustness, such as fine-tuning on curated datasets or incorporating explicit safety constraints into the model architecture."
