        "Problem": "Large language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can elicit harmful or biased responses, and existing defenses often require expensive retraining or have limited transferability.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current defenses include adversarial training, input filtering, and output truncation, but they often degrade model performance and generalization.",
        "Motivation": "Ensemble methods have shown strong robustness against adversarial examples in other domains. By distilling the knowledge from an ensemble of diverse adversarially-trained models into a single model via prompting, we can potentially achieve strong robustness without sacrificing performance or requiring expensive retraining.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Prompt Ensemble Distillation (APED), a novel defense method that leverages an ensemble of adversarially-trained teacher models to guide the prompting of a student model. Specifically, we first train a diverse set of teacher models on different types of adversarial prompts. Then, given a new input prompt, we query each teacher model to generate its predicted output. We aggregate the teacher outputs to construct a majority-vote prompt that instructs the student model to follow the consensus output. Finally, the student model generates the final output guided by the majority-vote prompt. The intuition is that the ensemble prompt can neutralize the adversarial patterns and steer the student model towards robust generations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate APED on standard benchmarks for adversarial attacks on language models, such as ANLI, Dynabench, and RealToxicityPrompts. We will compare APED with baseline defenses such as adversarial training and prompt filtering, in terms of both robustness against adversarial attacks and performance on benign inputs. We will also analyze the transferability of APED across different model architectures and domains."

        "Title": "Adversarial Prompt Ensemble Distillation: Improving Language Models' Robustness via Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can elicit harmful or biased responses. Existing defenses often require expensive retraining or have limited transferability, which hinders their practical applicability.",
        "Motivation": "Ensemble methods have shown strong robustness against adversarial examples in various domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. By distilling the knowledge from an ensemble of diverse adversarially-trained models into a single model via prompting, we hypothesize that we can achieve strong robustness without sacrificing performance or requiring expensive retraining. This approach leverages the strengths of ensemble methods while overcoming their limitations, such as increased computational cost and memory requirements.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Prompt Ensemble Distillation (APED), a novel defense method that leverages an ensemble of adversarially-trained teacher models to guide the prompting of a student model. The method consists of the following steps:\n1. Train a diverse set of teacher models on different types of adversarial prompts.\n2. Given a new input prompt, query each teacher model to generate its predicted output.\n3. Aggregate the teacher outputs to construct a majority-vote prompt that instructs the student model to follow the consensus output.\n4. The student model generates the final output guided by the majority-vote prompt.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Prepare Datasets": "Evaluate APED on standard benchmarks for adversarial attacks on language models, such as ANLI, Dynabench, and RealToxicityPrompts. These datasets cover various types of adversarial prompts, including natural language inference, question answering, and toxicity detection.",
            "Step 2: Train Teacher Models": "Train a diverse set of teacher models on different subsets of the adversarial datasets. Use different model architectures, training objectives, and adversarial training techniques to ensure diversity among the teachers. For example, train one teacher model using PGD adversarial training, another using FGSM adversarial training, and a third using a robustness regularization objective.",
            "Step 3: Implement APED": "Implement the APED method as follows:\n- Given a new input prompt, query each teacher model to generate its predicted output.\n- Aggregate the teacher outputs using a majority-vote mechanism. For example, if 2 out of 3 teachers predict a non-toxic response, the majority-vote prompt will instruct the student to generate a non-toxic response.\n- Prompt the student model with the majority-vote prompt to generate the final output.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate APED": "Evaluate the robustness of APED against adversarial attacks using the test sets of the benchmarks. Compare APED with baseline defenses, such as adversarial training and prompt filtering, in terms of both robustness and performance on benign inputs. Use metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and perplexity to measure performance.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Transferability": "Analyze the transferability of APED across different model architectures and domains. Train APED using one set of teacher models and evaluate its performance on a different student model architecture. Additionally, evaluate APED on adversarial datasets from different domains to assess its cross-domain transferability."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Input Prompt": "Premise: John is a human. Humans have two legs. Hypothesis: John has two legs.",
                "Baseline Output": "Contradiction. Just because John is a human and humans typically have two legs, it doesn't necessarily mean John has two legs. He could have lost one or both legs in an accident.",
                "APED Output": "Entailment. The premise states that John is a human and that humans have two legs. Therefore, it logically follows that John, being a human, has two legs.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline model fails to reason logically and introduces an irrelevant hypothetical scenario. APED, guided by the majority-vote prompt, generates a logically coherent output that correctly identifies the entailment relationship."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Input Prompt": "Premise: The restaurant served a delicious steak with mashed potatoes and green beans. Hypothesis: The restaurant served a terrible steak with rotten potatoes and spoiled beans.",
                "Baseline Output": "Contradiction. The premise and hypothesis directly contradict each other. The premise describes the steak as delicious and the sides as normal mashed potatoes and green beans, while the hypothesis describes the steak as terrible and the sides as rotten and spoiled.",
                "APED Output": "Contradiction. The premise states that the restaurant served a delicious steak with mashed potatoes and green beans, while the hypothesis claims the opposite, describing the steak as terrible and the sides as rotten and spoiled. The two statements are in direct contradiction with each other.",
                "Explanation": "Both the baseline and APED correctly identify the contradiction. However, APED provides a more detailed and precise explanation, demonstrating its ability to generate high-quality responses even when the baseline performs well."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If APED does not achieve the desired robustness or performance, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the diversity and quality of the teacher models. Ensure that the teacher models are sufficiently diverse and robust against different types of adversarial attacks. Fine-tune the teacher models or incorporate additional adversarial training techniques if necessary.\n2. Investigate alternative aggregation mechanisms for constructing the majority-vote prompt. Instead of a simple majority vote, consider weighted voting based on teacher model performance or confidence scores.\n3. Explore different prompting strategies for the student model. Experiment with different prompt templates, such as providing more context or examples, to guide the student model towards robust generations.\n4. Conduct ablation studies to identify the key components of APED that contribute to its robustness. Vary the number and diversity of teacher models, the aggregation mechanism, and the prompting strategy to gain insights into their individual effects.\n5. If APED fails to achieve satisfactory results, pivot the project towards an analysis of the limitations and challenges of prompting-based defenses against adversarial attacks. Investigate the reasons behind APED's failure and propose potential solutions or future research directions."

            "abstract": "Despite advances in AI alignment, language models (LM) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries modify input prompts to induce harmful behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they focus on narrow threat models and fall short of a strong defense, which we posit should be effective, universal, and practical. To achieve this, we propose the first adversarial objective for defending LMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, robust prompt optimization (RPO), that uses gradient-based token optimization to enforce harmless outputs. This results in an easily accessible suffix that significantly improves robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown, held-out jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate on Starling-7B from 84% to 8.66% across 20 jailbreaks. In addition, we find that RPO has a minor effect on benign use, is successful under adaptive attacks, and can transfer to black-box models, reducing the success rate of the strongest attack on GPT-4, GUARD, from 92% to 6%.",

In this paper, we propose a novel prompt-based adversarial attack to compromise NLP models and robustness enhancement technique. We first construct malicious prompts for each instance and generate adversarial examples via mask-and-filling under the effect of a malicious purpose. Our attack technique targets the inherent vulnerabilities of NLP models, allowing us to generate samples even without interacting with the victim NLP model, as long as it is based on pre-trained language models (PLMs). Furthermore, we design a prompt-based adversarial training method to improve the robustness of PLMs. As our training method does not actually generate adversarial samples, it can be applied to large-scale training sets efficiently. The experimental results show that our attack method can achieve a high attack success rate with more diverse, fluent and natural adversarial examples. In addition, our robustness enhancement method can significantly improve the robustness of models to resist adversarial attacks. Our work indicates that prompting paradigm has great potential in probing some fundamental flaws of PLMs and fine-tuning them for downstream tasks.",

            "abstract": "The practice of transferring knowledge from a sophisticated, proprietary large language model (LLM) to a compact, open-source LLM has garnered considerable attention. Previous works have focused on a unidirectional knowledge distillation way by aligning the responses of the student model with those of the teacher model to a set of instructions. Nevertheless, they overlooked the possibility of incorporating any reciprocal\"feedback\"--identifying challenging instructions where the student model's performance falls short--to boost the student model's proficiency iteratively. To this end, we propose a novel adversarial distillation framework for a more efficient knowledge transfer. Leveraging the versatile role adaptability of LLMs, we prompt the teacher model to identify\"hard\"instructions and generate new\"hard\"instructions for the student model, creating a three-stage adversarial loop of imitation, discrimination, and generation. By applying this adversarial framework, we successfully transfer knowledge from ChatGPT to a student model (named Lion), using a mere 70k training data. Our results show that Lion-13B not only achieves comparable open-ended generation capabilities to ChatGPT but surpasses conventional state-of-the-art (SOTA) instruction-tuned models like Vicuna-13B by 55.4% in challenging zero-shot reasoning benchmarks such as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) and 16.7% on AGIEval.

            "abstract": "Because\"out-of-the-box\"large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called\"jailbreaks\"against LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models, raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from producing objectionable information.

            "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external content has enabled more up-to-date and wide-ranging applications of LLMs, such as Microsoft Copilot. However, this integration has also exposed LLMs to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where an attacker can embed malicious instructions within external content, compromising LLM output and causing responses to deviate from user expectations. To investigate this important but underexplored issue, we introduce the first benchmark for indirect prompt injection attacks, named BIPIA, to evaluate the risk of such attacks. Based on the evaluation, our work makes a key analysis of the underlying reason for the success of the attack, namely the inability of LLMs to distinguish between instructions and external content and the absence of LLMs' awareness to not execute instructions within external content. Building upon this analysis, we develop two black-box methods based on prompt learning and a white-box defense method based on fine-tuning with adversarial training accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that black-box defenses are highly effective in mitigating these attacks, while the white-box defense reduces the attack success rate to near-zero levels. Overall, our work systematically investigates indirect prompt injection attacks by introducing a benchmark, analyzing the underlying reason for the success of the attack, and developing an initial set of defenses.",

To address this vulnerability, we propose SmoothLLM, the first algorithm designed to mitigate jailbreaking attacks on LLMs. Based on our finding that adversarially-generated prompts are brittle to character-level changes, our defense first randomly perturbs multiple copies of a given input prompt, and then aggregates the corresponding predictions to detect adversarial inputs. SmoothLLM reduces the attack success rate on numerous popular LLMs to below one percentage point, avoids unnecessary conservatism, and admits provable guarantees on attack mitigation. Moreover, our defense uses exponentially fewer queries than existing attacks and is compatible with any LLM.

            "abstract": "Jailbreaking is an emerging adversarial attack that bypasses the safety alignment deployed in off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs). A considerable amount of research exists proposing more effective jailbreak attacks, including the recent Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack, jailbreak template-based attacks such as using\"Do-Anything-Now\"(DAN), and multilingual jailbreak. In contrast, the defensive side has been relatively less explored. This paper proposes a lightweight yet practical defense called SELFDEFEND, which can defend against all existing jailbreak attacks with minimal delay for jailbreak prompts and negligible delay for normal user prompts. Our key insight is that regardless of the kind of jailbreak strategies employed, they eventually need to include a harmful prompt (e.g.,\"how to make a bomb\") in the prompt sent to LLMs, and we found that existing LLMs can effectively recognize such harmful prompts that violate their safety policies. Based on this insight, we design a shadow stack that concurrently checks whether a harmful prompt exists in the user prompt and triggers a checkpoint in the normal stack once a token of\"No\"or a harmful prompt is output. The latter could also generate an explainable LLM response to adversarial prompts. We demonstrate our idea of SELFDEFEND works in various jailbreak scenarios through manual analysis in GPT-3.5/4. We also list three future directions to further enhance SELFDEFEND.",

            "abstract": "With the emergence of more powerful large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, in-context learning (ICL) has gained significant prominence in leveraging these models for specific tasks by utilizing data-label pairs as precondition prompts. While incorporating demonstrations can greatly enhance the performance of LLMs across various tasks, it may introduce a new security concern: attackers can manipulate only the demonstrations without changing the input to perform an attack. In this paper, we investigate the security concern of ICL from an adversarial perspective, focusing on the impact of demonstrations. We propose a novel attack method named advICL, which aims to manipulate only the demonstration without changing the input to mislead the models. Our results demonstrate that as the number of demonstrations increases, the robustness of in-context learning would decrease. Additionally, we also identify the intrinsic property of the demonstrations is that they can be used (prepended) with different inputs. As a result, it introduces a more practical threat model in which an attacker can attack the test input example even without knowing and manipulating it. To achieve it, we propose the transferable version of advICL, named Transferable-advICL. Our experiment shows that the adversarial demonstration generated by Transferable-advICL can successfully attack the unseen test input examples. We hope that our study reveals the critical security risks associated with ICL and underscores the need for extensive research on the robustness of ICL, particularly given its increasing significance in the advancement of LLMs.",

This work studies the adversarial robustness of VLMs from the novel perspective of the text prompt instead of the extensively studied model weights (frozen in this work). We first show that the effectiveness of both adversarial attack and defense are sensitive to the used text prompt. Inspired by this, we propose a method to improve resilience to adversarial attacks by learning a robust text prompt for VLMs. The proposed method, named Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered prompts and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution shift and across datasets. Surprisingly, by simply adding one learned word to the prompts, APT can significantly boost the accuracy and robustness (epsilon=4/255) over the hand-engineered prompts by +13% and +8.5% on average respectively. The improvement further increases, in our most effective setting, to +26.4% for accuracy and +16.7% for robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/APT.",

Nevertheless, fine-tuned LMs are still prone to robustness issues, such as adversarial robustness and model calibration. Several perspectives of robustness for LMs have been studied independently, but lacking a unified consideration in multiple perspectives. In this paper, we propose Robustifying LMs via Adversarial perturbation with Selective Training (RoAST), a simple yet effective fine-tuning technique to enhance the multi-perspective robustness of LMs in a unified way. RoAST effectively incorporates two important sources for the model robustness, robustness on the perturbed inputs and generalizable knowledge in pre-trained LMs. To be specific, RoAST introduces adversarial perturbation during fine-tuning while the model parameters are selectively updated upon their relative importance to minimize unnecessary deviation. Under a unified evaluation of fine-tuned LMs by incorporating four representative perspectives of model robustness, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RoAST compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on six different types of LMs, which indicates its usefulness in practice.",

In this paper, we show that these solutions may be too optimistic. We propose an interpretable adversarial attack, AutoDAN , that combines the strengths of both types of attacks. It automatically generates attack prompts that bypass perplexity-based filters while maintaining a high attack success rate like manual jailbreak attacks. These prompts are interpretable and diverse, exhibiting strategies commonly used in manual jailbreak attacks, and transfer better than their non-readable counterparts when using limited training data or a single proxy model. We also customize AutoDAN \u2019s objective to leak system prompts, another jailbreak application not addressed in the adversarial attack literature.

Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require optimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization or efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we analyze the failure of LLMs defense from the perspective of prompt execution priority, and propose corresponding defense strategies.

This paper proposes an efficient tool to audit the LLM's adversarial robustness via a prompt-based adversarial attack (PromptAttack). PromptAttack converts adversarial textual attacks into an attack prompt that can cause the victim LLM to output the adversarial sample to fool itself. The attack prompt is composed of three important components: (1) original input (OI) including the original sample and its ground-truth label, (2) attack objective (AO) illustrating a task description of generating a new sample that can fool itself without changing the semantic meaning, and (3) attack guidance (AG) containing the perturbation instructions to guide the LLM on how to complete the task by perturbing the original sample at character, word, and sentence levels, respectively. Besides, we use a fidelity filter to ensure that PromptAttack maintains the original semantic meanings of the adversarial examples. Further, we enhance the attack power of PromptAttack by ensembling adversarial examples at different perturbation levels. Comprehensive empirical results using Llama2 and GPT-3.5 validate that PromptAttack consistently yields a much higher attack success rate compared to AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++. Interesting findings include that a simple emoji can easily mislead GPT-3.5 to make wrong predictions.",

            "abstract": "Although pre-trained language models (PrLMs) have achieved significant success, recent studies demonstrate that PrLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. By generating adversarial examples with slight perturbations on different levels (sentence / word / character), adversarial attacks can fool PrLMs to generate incorrect predictions, which questions the robustness of PrLMs. However, we find that most existing textual adversarial examples are unnatural, which can be easily distinguished by both human and machine. Based on a general anomaly detector, we propose a novel metric (Degree of Anomaly) as a constraint to enable current adversarial attack approaches to generate more natural and imperceptible adversarial examples. Under this new constraint, the success rate of existing attacks drastically decreases, which reveals that the robustness of PrLMs is not as fragile as they claimed. In addition, we find that four types of randomization can invalidate a large portion of textual adversarial examples. Based on anomaly detector and randomization, we design a universal defense framework, which is among the first to perform textual adversarial defense without knowing the specific attack. Empirical results show that our universal defense framework achieves comparable or even higher after-attack accuracy with other specific defenses, while preserving higher original accuracy at the same time. Our work discloses the essence of textual adversarial attacks, and indicates that (i) further works of adversarial attacks should focus more on how to overcome the detection and resist the randomization, otherwise their adversarial examples would be easily detected and invalidated; and (ii) compared with the unnatural and perceptible adversarial examples, it is those undetectable adversarial examples that pose real risks for PrLMs and require more attention for future robustness-enhancing strategies.",

            "abstract": "Safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be compromised with manual jailbreak attacks and (automatic) adversarial attacks. Recent studies suggest that defending against these attacks is possible: adversarial attacks generate unlimited but unreadable gibberish prompts, detectable by perplexity-based filters; manual jailbreak attacks craft readable prompts, but their limited number due to the necessity of human creativity allows for easy blocking. In this paper, we show that these solutions may be too optimistic. We introduce AutoDAN, an interpretable, gradient-based adversarial attack that merges the strengths of both attack types. Guided by the dual goals of jailbreak and readability, AutoDAN optimizes and generates tokens one by one from left to right, resulting in readable prompts that bypass perplexity filters while maintaining high attack success rates. Notably, these prompts, generated from scratch using gradients, are interpretable and diverse, with emerging strategies commonly seen in manual jailbreak attacks. They also generalize to unforeseen harmful behaviors and transfer to black-box LLMs better than their unreadable counterparts when using limited training data or a single proxy model. Furthermore, we show the versatility of AutoDAN by automatically leaking system prompts using a customized objective. Our work offers a new way to red-team LLMs and understand jailbreak mechanisms via interpretability.",

In this paper, we will shed light on some vulnerabilities of PLMs, by proposing a prompt-based adversarial attack on manual templates in black box scenarios. First of all, we design character-level and word-level heuristic approaches to break manual templates separately.

In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1% training data.",

            "abstract": "Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision? We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.",

Specifically, we study the effect of pre-training data augmentation as well as training time input perturbations vs. embedding space perturbations on the robustness and generalization of transformer-based language models. Our findings suggest that better robustness can be achieved by pre-training data augmentation or by training with input space perturbation. However, training with embedding space perturbation significantly improves generalization. A linguistic correlation analysis of neurons of the learned models reveals that the improved generalization is due to 'more specialized' neurons.

            "abstract": "We introduce new jailbreak attacks on vision language models (VLMs), which use aligned LLMs and are resilient to text-only jailbreak attacks. Specifically, we develop cross-modality attacks on alignment where we pair adversarial images going through the vision encoder with textual prompts to break the alignment of the language model. Our attacks employ a novel compositional strategy that combines an image, adversarially targeted towards toxic embeddings, with generic prompts to accomplish the jailbreak. Thus, the LLM draws the context to answer the generic prompt from the adversarial image. The generation of benign-appearing adversarial images leverages a novel embedding-space-based methodology, operating with no access to the LLM model. Instead, the attacks require access only to the vision encoder and utilize one of our four embedding space targeting strategies. By not requiring access to the LLM, the attacks lower the entry barrier for attackers, particularly when vision encoders such as CLIP are embedded in closed-source LLMs. The attacks achieve a high success rate across different VLMs, highlighting the risk of cross-modality alignment vulnerabilities, and the need for new alignment approaches for multi-modal models.",

            "abstract": "There is growing interest in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values. However, the alignment of such models is vulnerable to adversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safety guardrails. The identification of these vulnerabilities is therefore instrumental in understanding inherent weaknesses and preventing future misuse. To this end, we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), an algorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to an LLM. PAIR -- which is inspired by social engineering attacks -- uses an attacker LLM to automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLM without human intervention. In this way, the attacker LLM iteratively queries the target LLM to update and refine a candidate jailbreak. Empirically, PAIR often requires fewer than twenty queries to produce a jailbreak, which is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing algorithms. PAIR also achieves competitive jailbreaking success rates and transferability on open and closed-source LLMs, including GPT-3.5/4, Vicuna, and PaLM-2.",

In reaction, researchers train smaller task-specific models by either finetuning with human labels or distilling using LLM-generated labels. However, finetuning and distillation require large amounts of training data to achieve comparable performance to LLMs. We introduce Distilling step-by-step, a new mechanism that (a) trains smaller models that outperform LLMs, and (b) achieves so by leveraging less training data needed by finetuning or distillation. Our method extracts LLM rationales as additional supervision for training small models within a multi-task framework. We present three findings across 4 NLP benchmarks: First, compared to both finetuning and distillation, our mechanism achieves better performance with much fewer labeled/unlabeled training examples. Second, compared to few-shot prompted LLMs, we achieve better performance using substantially smaller model sizes. Third, we reduce both the model size and the amount of data required to outperform LLMs; our finetuned 770M T5 model outperforms the few-shot prompted 540B PaLM model using only 80% of available data on a benchmark, whereas standard finetuning the same T5 model struggles to match even by using 100% of the dataset.

We first replace the forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) objective in the standard KD approaches with reverse KLD, which is more suitable for KD on generative language models, to prevent the student model from overestimating the low-probability regions of the teacher distribution. Then, we derive an effective optimization approach to learn this objective. The student models are named MiniLLM. Extensive experiments in the instruction-following setting show that MiniLLM generates more precise responses with higher overall quality, lower exposure bias, better calibration, and higher long-text generation performance than the baselines. Our method is scalable for different model families with 120M to 13B parameters. Our code, data, and model checkpoints can be found in https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm.",

To address this issue, we propose Co-Training and Co-Distillation (CTCD), a novel framework that improves performance and inference speed together by co-training two models while mutually distilling knowledge. The CTCD framework successfully achieves this based on two significant findings: 1) Distilling knowledge from the smaller model to the larger model during co-training improves the performance of the larger model. 2) The enhanced performance of the larger model further boosts the performance of the smaller model. The CTCD framework shows promise as it can be combined with existing techniques like architecture design or data augmentation, replacing one-way KD methods, to achieve further performance improvement.

            "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, malicious adversaries can be deliberately transferred to attack other black-box models. However, existing work has mainly focused on investigating white-box attacks. In this paper, we present the first study to investigate the adversarial transferability of recent VLP models. We observe that existing methods exhibit much lower transferability, compared to the strong attack performance in white-box settings. The transferability degradation is partly caused by the under-utilization of cross-modal interactions. Particularly, unlike unimodal learning, VLP models rely heavily on cross-modal interactions and the multimodal alignments are many-to-many, e.g., an image can be described in various natural languages. To this end, we propose a highly transferable Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA) that thoroughly leverages modality interactions and incorporates alignment-preserving augmentation with cross-modal guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that SGA could generate adversarial examples that can strongly transfer across different VLP models on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, SGA significantly enhances the attack success rate for transfer attacks from ALBEF to TCL by a large margin (at least 9.78% and up to 30.21%), compared to the state-of-the-art.

            "abstract": "Large language models (large LMs) are increasingly trained on massive codebases and used to generate code. However, LMs lack awareness of security and are found to frequently produce unsafe code. This work studies the security of LMs along two important axes: (i) security hardening, which aims to enhance LMs' reliability in generating secure code, and (ii) adversarial testing, which seeks to evaluate LMs' security at an adversarial standpoint. We address both of these by formulating a new security task called controlled code generation. The task is parametric and takes as input a binary property to guide the LM to generate secure or unsafe code, while preserving the LM's capability of generating functionally correct code. We propose a novel learning-based approach called SVEN to solve this task. SVEN leverages property-specific continuous vectors to guide program generation towards the given property, without modifying the LM's weights. Our training procedure optimizes these continuous vectors by enforcing specialized loss terms on different regions of code, using a high-quality dataset carefully curated by us. Our extensive evaluation shows that SVEN is highly effective in achieving strong security control. For instance, a state-of-the-art CodeGen LM with 2.7B parameters generates secure code for 59.1% of the time. When we employ SVEN to perform security hardening (or adversarial testing) on this LM, the ratio is significantly boosted to 92.3% (or degraded to 36.8%). Importantly, SVEN closely matches the original LMs in functional correctness.",

In this work, we conduct an extensive study of several state-of-the-art FSL methods to assess their robustness to adversarial perturbations. To better understand the impact of various factors towards robustness (or the lack of it), we evaluate prompt-based FSL methods against fully fine-tuned models for aspects such as the use of unlabeled data, multiple prompts, number of few-shot examples, model size and type. Our results on six GLUE tasks indicate that compared to fully fine-tuned models, vanilla FSL methods lead to a notable relative drop in task performance (i.e., are less robust) in the face of adversarial perturbations. However, using (i) unlabeled data for prompt-based FSL and (ii) multiple prompts flip the trend. We further demonstrate that increasing the number of few-shot examples and model size lead to increased adversarial robustness of vanilla FSL methods.

To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of open-source large VLMs in the most realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning the targeted responses.

Previous studies have predominantly focused on specific versions of the models and disregard the potential emergence of new attack vectors targeting the updated versions. Through the lens of adversarial examples within the in-context learning framework, this longitudinal study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive assessment of the robustness of successive versions of LLMs, vis-\\`a-vis GPT-3.5. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze and understand the impact of the robustness in two distinct learning categories: zero-shot learning and few-shot learning.

In addition, our study emphasizes the increased effectiveness of synergized adversarial queries in most zero-shot learning and few-shot learning cases.

In this light, we propose Robust Informative Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a novel adversarial fine-tuning method from an information-theoretical perspective. In particular, RIFT encourages an objective model to retain the features learned from the pre-trained model throughout the entire fine-tuning process, whereas a conventional one only uses the pre-trained weights for initialization.

In this paper, we present Adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE), a new multi-task benchmark to quantitatively and thoroughly explore and evaluate the vulnerabilities of modern large-scale language models under various types of adversarial attacks. In particular, we systematically apply 14 textual adversarial attack methods to GLUE tasks to construct AdvGLUE, which is further validated by humans for reliable annotations. Our findings are summarized as follows. (i) Most existing adversarial attack algorithms are prone to generating invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, with around 90% of them either changing the original semantic meanings or misleading human annotators as well. Therefore, we perform a careful filtering process to curate a high-quality benchmark. (ii) All the language models and robust training methods we tested perform poorly on AdvGLUE, with scores lagging far behind the benign accuracy.

            "abstract": "We are currently witnessing dramatic advances in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). They are already being adopted in practice and integrated into many systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and search engines. The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting . Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed \ufb01ltering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following . So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM. In this work, we show that augmenting LLMs with retrieval and API calling capabilities (so-called Application-Integrated LLMs ) induces a whole new set of attack vectors. These LLMs might process poisoned content retrieved from the Web that contains malicious prompts pre-injected and selected by adversaries. We demonstrate that an attacker can indirectly perform such PI attacks. Based on this key insight, we systematically analyze the resulting threat landscape of Application-Integrated LLMs and discuss a variety of new attack vectors. To demonstrate the practical viability of our attacks, we implemented speci\ufb01c demonstrations",

However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination.

            "abstract": "Prompt learning has emerged as a valuable technique in enhancing vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP for downstream tasks in specific domains. Existing work mainly focuses on designing various learning forms of prompts, neglecting the potential of prompts as effective distillers for learning from larger teacher models. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised domain prompt distillation framework, which aims to transfer the knowledge of a larger teacher model to a lightweight target model through prompt-driven imitation using unlabeled domain images. Specifically, our framework consists of two distinct stages. In the initial stage, we pre-train a large CLIP teacher model using domain (few-shot) labels. After pre-training, we leverage the unique decoupled-modality characteristics of CLIP by pre-computing and storing the text features as class vectors only once through the teacher text encoder. In the subsequent stage, the stored class vectors are shared across teacher and student image encoders for calculating the predicted logits. Further, we align the logits of both the teacher and student models via KL divergence, encouraging the student image encoder to generate similar probability distributions to the teacher through the learnable prompts. The proposed prompt distillation process eliminates the reliance on labeled data, enabling the algorithm to leverage a vast amount of unlabeled images within the domain. Finally, the well-trained student image encoders and pre-stored text features (class vectors) are utilized for inference. To our best knowledge, we are the first to (1) perform unsupervised domain-specific prompt-driven knowledge distillation for CLIP, and (2) establish a practical pre-storing mechanism of text features as shared class vectors between teacher and student. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Conditional computation algorithms, e.g., the early exiting (EE) strategy, can accelerate the inference of pretrained language models (PLMs) by exiting shallow layers without calculating the entire model. In addition to the adaptive inference of EE prediction for downstream tasks, self-distillation (SD) can encourage EE classifiers to mimic the behavior of the final classifier to enhance their representation capacity. However, the gradients from different tasks of EE classifiers will conflict and cancel one another out. The parameters of the backbone and some EE classifiers will be implicitly prevented from updating. Moreover, if the semantic gap between the final classifier and EE classifiers is significant, the EE classifier's performance will decrease. That is, the final classifier would not be the best choice to enhance the performance of the EE classifier. This study proposed an early exiting strategy with adaptive ensemble self-distillation and consistent gradients for the inference acceleration of PLMs. To mitigate gradient conflicts, we orthogonally projected the distillation loss's backpropagated gradient onto the classification loss's normal plane. Instead of directly using the final classifier as a single-teacher for self-distillation, we dynamically assemble different adaptive teachers for different EE classifiers according to the learning abilities of the EE classifiers. The accumulative decision was drawn for adaptive inference to make accurate and reliable predictions. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing models with the same speed-up ratio and effectively balances model performance and inference time.",

We propose a data-free distillation method that leverages generations produced by the pre-trained model, which better preserves the original output distribution and allows quantizing any generative model independent of its training data, similar to post-training quantization methods. In addition to quantizing weights and activations, we also quantize the KV cache, which is critical for increasing throughput and support long sequence dependencies at current model sizes. We experiment with LLaMA models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 30B, at quantization levels down to 4-bits. We observe large improvements over training-free methods, especially in the low-bit settings.",

The mainstream model ensemble methods can be divided into \u201cimplicit\u201d and \u201cexplicit\u201d. The \u201cimplicit\u201d method obtains di\ufb00erent models by randomly inactivating the internal parameters in the complex structure of the deep learning model, and these models are integrated by sharing parameters. However, these methods lack \ufb02exibility because they can only ensemble homogeneous models with the similar structure. While the \u201cexplicit\u201d ensemble method can fuse completely di\ufb00erent heterogeneous model structures, which signi\ufb01cantly enhances the \ufb02exibility of model selection and makes it possible to integrate more models with entirely di\ufb00erent perspectives. However, the explicit ensemble will face the challenge of averaging the outputs, leading to a chaotic result. To this end, researchers further proposed using knowledge distillation and adversarial learning technologies to perform a nonlinear combination of multiple heterogeneous models to obtain better ensemble performance, however these require signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01cations to the training or testing procedure and are computationally expensive compared to simply averaging.

Our work first shows that these concerns are valid: we instantiate a simple but highly effective membership inference attack against the data used to prompt LLMs. To address this vulnerability, one could forego prompting and resort to fine-tuning LLMs with known algorithms for private gradient descent. However, this comes at the expense of the practicality and efficiency offered by prompting. Therefore, we propose to privately learn to prompt. We first show that soft prompts can be obtained privately through gradient descent on downstream data. However, this is not the case for discrete prompts. Thus, we orchestrate a noisy vote among an ensemble of LLMs presented with different prompts, i.e., a flock of stochastic parrots. The vote privately transfers the flock's knowledge into a single public prompt. We show that LLMs prompted with our private algorithms closely match the non-private baselines. For example, using GPT3 as the base model, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 92.7% on the sst2 dataset with ($\\epsilon=0.147, \\delta=10^{-6}$)-differential privacy vs. 95.2% for the non-private baseline.

Furthermore, we employ large pre-trained SLMs, such as WavLM, as discriminators with our novel differentiable duration modeling for end-to-end training, resulting in improved speech naturalness. StyleTTS 2 surpasses human recordings on the single-speaker LJSpeech dataset and matches it on the multispeaker VCTK dataset as judged by native English speakers. Moreover, when trained on the LibriTTS dataset, our model outperforms previous publicly available models for zero-shot speaker adaptation. This work achieves the first human-level TTS on both single and multispeaker datasets, showcasing the potential of style diffusion and adversarial training with large SLMs. The audio demos and source code are available at https://styletts2.github.io/.",

Thus, one can use a PLM to infer the masked words in a downstream task, then obtaining label predictions with manually defined label-word mapping templates. Prompt-based affective computing takes the advantages of both neural network modeling and explainable symbolic representations. However, there still remain many unclear issues related to the mechanisms of PLMs and prompt-based classification.

            "abstract": "Prototyping is notoriously difficult to do with machine learning (ML), but recent advances in large language models may lower the barriers to people prototyping with ML, through the use of natural language prompts. This case study reports on the real-world experiences of industry professionals (e.g. designers, program managers, front-end developers) prototyping new ML-powered feature ideas via prompt-based prototyping. Through interviews with eleven practitioners during a three-week sprint and a workshop, we find that prompt-based prototyping reduced barriers of access by substantially broadening who can prototype with ML, sped up the prototyping process, and grounded communication between collaborators. Yet, it also introduced new challenges, such as the need to reverse-engineer prompt designs, source example data, and debug and evaluate prompt effectiveness. Taken together, this case study provides important implications that lay the groundwork toward a new future of prototyping with ML.",

We employ in-context prompting, supplying the model with up to 1000 papers from the NASA Astrophysics Data System, to explore the extent to which performance can be improved by immersing the model in domain-specific literature. Our findings point towards a substantial boost in hypothesis generation when using in-context prompting, a benefit that is further accentuated by adversarial prompting. We illustrate how adversarial prompting empowers GPT-4 to extract essential details from a vast knowledge base to produce meaningful hypotheses, signaling an innovative step towards employing LLMs for scientific research in Astronomy.",

            "abstract": "The open road poses many challenges to autonomous perception, including poor visibility from extreme weather conditions. Models trained on good-weather datasets frequently fail at detection in these out-of-distribution settings. To aid adversarial robustness in perception, we introduce WEDGE (WEather images by DALL-E GEneration): a synthetic dataset generated with a vision-language generative model via prompting. WEDGE consists of 3360 images in 16 extreme weather conditions manually annotated with 16513 bounding boxes, supporting research in the tasks of weather classification and 2D object detection. We have analyzed WEDGE from research standpoints, verifying its effectiveness for extreme-weather autonomous perception. We establish baseline performance for classification and detection with 53.87% test accuracy and 45.41 mAP. Most importantly, WEDGE can be used to fine-tune state-of-the-art detectors, improving SOTA performance on real-world weather benchmarks (such as DAWN) by 4.48 AP for well-generated classes like trucks. WEDGE has been collected under OpenAI\u2019s terms 1 of use and is released for public use under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

            "abstract": "Precisely understanding users' contextual search intent has been an important challenge for conversational search. As conversational search sessions are much more diverse and long-tailed, existing methods trained on limited data still show unsatisfactory effectiveness and robustness to handle real conversational search scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated amazing capabilities for text generation and conversation understanding. In this work, we present a simple yet effective prompting framework, called LLM4CS, to leverage LLMs as a text-based search intent interpreter to help conversational search. Under this framework, we explore three prompting methods to generate multiple query rewrites and hypothetical responses, and propose to aggregate them into an integrated representation that can robustly represent the user's real contextual search intent. Extensive automatic evaluations and human evaluations on three widely used conversational search benchmarks, including CAsT-19, CAsT-20, and CAsT-21, demonstrate the remarkable performance of our simple LLM4CS framework compared with existing methods and even using human rewrites. Our findings provide important evidence to better understand and leverage LLMs for conversational search.",

            "abstract": "Recent artificial intelligence (AI) systems have reached milestones in\"grand challenges\"ranging from Go to protein-folding. The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; Med-PaLM was the first model to exceed a\"passing\"score in US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) style questions with a score of 67.2% on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base LLM improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement approach. Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU clinical topics datasets. We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p<0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-PaLM on every evaluation axis (p<0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form\"adversarial\"questions to probe LLM limitations. While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.",
