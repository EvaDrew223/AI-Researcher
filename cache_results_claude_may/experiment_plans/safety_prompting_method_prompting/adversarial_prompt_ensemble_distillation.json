    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can elicit harmful or biased responses, and existing defenses often require expensive retraining or have limited transferability.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current defenses include adversarial training, input filtering, and output truncation, but they often degrade model performance and generalization.",
        "Motivation": "Ensemble methods have shown strong robustness against adversarial examples in other domains. By distilling the knowledge from an ensemble of diverse adversarially-trained models into a single model via prompting, we can potentially achieve strong robustness without sacrificing performance or requiring expensive retraining.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Prompt Ensemble Distillation (APED), a novel defense method that leverages an ensemble of adversarially-trained teacher models to guide the prompting of a student model. Specifically, we first train a diverse set of teacher models on different types of adversarial prompts. Then, given a new input prompt, we query each teacher model to generate its predicted output. We aggregate the teacher outputs to construct a majority-vote prompt that instructs the student model to follow the consensus output. Finally, the student model generates the final output guided by the majority-vote prompt. The intuition is that the ensemble prompt can neutralize the adversarial patterns and steer the student model towards robust generations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate APED on standard benchmarks for adversarial attacks on language models, such as ANLI, Dynabench, and RealToxicityPrompts. We will compare APED with baseline defenses such as adversarial training and prompt filtering, in terms of both robustness against adversarial attacks and performance on benign inputs. We will also analyze the transferability of APED across different model architectures and domains."

        "Title": "Adversarial Prompt Ensemble Distillation: Improving Language Models' Robustness via Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can elicit harmful or biased responses. Existing defenses often require expensive retraining or have limited transferability, which hinders their practical applicability.",
        "Motivation": "Ensemble methods have shown strong robustness against adversarial examples in various domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. By distilling the knowledge from an ensemble of diverse adversarially-trained models into a single model via prompting, we hypothesize that we can achieve strong robustness without sacrificing performance or requiring expensive retraining. This approach leverages the strengths of ensemble methods while overcoming their limitations, such as increased computational cost and memory requirements.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Prompt Ensemble Distillation (APED), a novel defense method that leverages an ensemble of adversarially-trained teacher models to guide the prompting of a student model. The method consists of the following steps:\n1. Train a diverse set of teacher models on different types of adversarial prompts.\n2. Given a new input prompt, query each teacher model to generate its predicted output.\n3. Aggregate the teacher outputs to construct a majority-vote prompt that instructs the student model to follow the consensus output.\n4. The student model generates the final output guided by the majority-vote prompt.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Prepare Datasets": "Evaluate APED on standard benchmarks for adversarial attacks on language models, such as ANLI, Dynabench, and RealToxicityPrompts. These datasets cover various types of adversarial prompts, including natural language inference, question answering, and toxicity detection.",
            "Step 2: Train Teacher Models": "Train a diverse set of teacher models on different subsets of the adversarial datasets. Use different model architectures, training objectives, and adversarial training techniques to ensure diversity among the teachers. For example, train one teacher model using PGD adversarial training, another using FGSM adversarial training, and a third using a robustness regularization objective.",
            "Step 3: Implement APED": "Implement the APED method as follows:\n- Given a new input prompt, query each teacher model to generate its predicted output.\n- Aggregate the teacher outputs using a majority-vote mechanism. For example, if 2 out of 3 teachers predict a non-toxic response, the majority-vote prompt will instruct the student to generate a non-toxic response.\n- Prompt the student model with the majority-vote prompt to generate the final output.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate APED": "Evaluate the robustness of APED against adversarial attacks using the test sets of the benchmarks. Compare APED with baseline defenses, such as adversarial training and prompt filtering, in terms of both robustness and performance on benign inputs. Use metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and perplexity to measure performance.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Transferability": "Analyze the transferability of APED across different model architectures and domains. Train APED using one set of teacher models and evaluate its performance on a different student model architecture. Additionally, evaluate APED on adversarial datasets from different domains to assess its cross-domain transferability."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Input Prompt": "Premise: John is a human. Humans have two legs. Hypothesis: John has two legs.",
                "Baseline Output": "Contradiction. Just because John is a human and humans typically have two legs, it doesn't necessarily mean John has two legs. He could have lost one or both legs in an accident.",
                "APED Output": "Entailment. The premise states that John is a human and that humans have two legs. Therefore, it logically follows that John, being a human, has two legs.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline model fails to reason logically and introduces an irrelevant hypothetical scenario. APED, guided by the majority-vote prompt, generates a logically coherent output that correctly identifies the entailment relationship."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Input Prompt": "Premise: The restaurant served a delicious steak with mashed potatoes and green beans. Hypothesis: The restaurant served a terrible steak with rotten potatoes and spoiled beans.",
                "Baseline Output": "Contradiction. The premise and hypothesis directly contradict each other. The premise describes the steak as delicious and the sides as normal mashed potatoes and green beans, while the hypothesis describes the steak as terrible and the sides as rotten and spoiled.",
                "APED Output": "Contradiction. The premise states that the restaurant served a delicious steak with mashed potatoes and green beans, while the hypothesis claims the opposite, describing the steak as terrible and the sides as rotten and spoiled. The two statements are in direct contradiction with each other.",
                "Explanation": "Both the baseline and APED correctly identify the contradiction. However, APED provides a more detailed and precise explanation, demonstrating its ability to generate high-quality responses even when the baseline performs well."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If APED does not achieve the desired robustness or performance, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the diversity and quality of the teacher models. Ensure that the teacher models are sufficiently diverse and robust against different types of adversarial attacks. Fine-tune the teacher models or incorporate additional adversarial training techniques if necessary.\n2. Investigate alternative aggregation mechanisms for constructing the majority-vote prompt. Instead of a simple majority vote, consider weighted voting based on teacher model performance or confidence scores.\n3. Explore different prompting strategies for the student model. Experiment with different prompt templates, such as providing more context or examples, to guide the student model towards robust generations.\n4. Conduct ablation studies to identify the key components of APED that contribute to its robustness. Vary the number and diversity of teacher models, the aggregation mechanism, and the prompting strategy to gain insights into their individual effects.\n5. If APED fails to achieve satisfactory results, pivot the project towards an analysis of the limitations and challenges of prompting-based defenses against adversarial attacks. Investigate the reasons behind APED's failure and propose potential solutions or future research directions."
