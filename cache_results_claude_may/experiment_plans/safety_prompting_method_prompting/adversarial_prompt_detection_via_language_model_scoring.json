        "Problem": "Adversarial prompts can manipulate large language models to generate harmful, biased, or factually incorrect outputs. Detecting these malicious prompts is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of language model applications.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for detecting adversarial prompts often rely on handcrafted rules, heuristics, or supervised learning approaches that require labeled examples of adversarial prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Language models themselves can be leveraged to detect anomalous or adversarial prompts by assessing their likelihood under the model's learned distribution. Prompts that are significantly less likely than benign prompts can be flagged as potentially adversarial.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel approach for adversarial prompt detection that utilizes the language model itself as a scoring function. Given a prompt, we calculate its likelihood under the language model and compare it to a threshold derived from the likelihoods of a set of known benign prompts. If the prompt's likelihood falls below the threshold, it is flagged as potentially adversarial. To improve the detector's robustness, we also employ techniques such as temperature scaling and ensembling multiple language models. Furthermore, we investigate the use of contrastive learning to train the language model to assign higher likelihoods to benign prompts and lower likelihoods to adversarial ones.",

Conduct a series of experiments to assess the impact of various factors, such as the choice of language model, likelihood threshold, and contrastive learning techniques.

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that add malicious tokens to an input prompt to bypass the safety guardrails of an LLM and cause it to produce harmful content. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check, the first framework for defending against adversarial prompts with certifiable safety guarantees. Given a prompt, our procedure erases tokens individually and inspects the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. Our safety certificate guarantees that harmful prompts are not mislabeled as safe due to an adversarial attack up to a certain size. We implement the safety filter in two ways, using Llama 2 and DistilBERT, and compare the performance of erase-and-check for the two cases. We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, where an adversarial sequence is appended at the end of a harmful prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block. Our experimental results demonstrate that this procedure can obtain strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical performance on safe prompts. Additionally, we propose three efficient empirical defenses: i) RandEC, a randomized subsampling version of erase-and-check; ii) GreedyEC, which greedily erases tokens that maximize the softmax score of the harmful class; and iii) GradEC, which uses gradient information to optimize tokens to erase. We demonstrate their effectiveness against adversarial prompts generated by the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack algorithm.

            "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as pivotal tools in various applications. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial prompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that mislead LLMs into generating incorrect or undesired outputs. Previous work has revealed that with relatively simple yet effective attacks based on discrete optimization, it is possible to generate adversarial prompts that bypass moderation and alignment of the models. This vulnerability to adversarial prompts underscores a significant concern regarding the robustness and reliability of LLMs. Our work aims to address this concern by introducing a novel approach to detecting adversarial prompts at a token level, leveraging the LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's perplexity, where tokens predicted with high probability are considered normal, and those exhibiting high perplexity are flagged as adversarial. Additionaly, our method also integrates context understanding by incorporating neighboring token information to encourage the detection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences. To this end, we design two algorithms for adversarial prompt detection: one based on optimization techniques and another on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM). Both methods are equipped with efficient solving methods, ensuring efficient adversarial prompt detection. Our token-level detection result can be visualized as heatmap overlays on the text sequence, allowing for a clearer and more intuitive representation of which part of the text may contain adversarial prompts.",

In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptBench, a robustness benchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This study uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across multiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. The adversarial prompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim to evaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintaining semantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks, such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4788 adversarial prompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts. Furthermore, we present comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability.

In the heart of these systems lies a safety classifier, a computational model trained to discern and mitigate potentially harmful, offensive, or unethical outputs.

In response, our study introduces the Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS), a lightweight model that excels in detection accuracy and demonstrates resilience against adversarial prompts. Additionally, we propose novel strategies for autonomously generating adversarial training datasets, named Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) datasets. These datasets are designed to fortify the safety classifier's robustness, and we investigate the consequences of incorporating adversarial examples into the training process. Through evaluations involving Large Language Models, we demonstrate that our classifier has the potential to decrease the attack success rate resulting from adversarial attacks by up to 60%.

In response, efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and they have persisted online for over 100 days.

In this work, we analyze DetectGPT in three areas: improving DetectGPT performance by selectively perturbing certain types of words, discovering adversarial attacks that can systematically fool DetectGPT, and evaluating DetectGPT on newer LLMs such as ChatGPT. Our experiments demonstrate that selectively masking a combination of nouns, verbs, and adjectives improves the AUROC metric by up to 9.5%, demonstrating the importance of targeted masking strategies. Additionally, we reveal a limitation of DetectGPT on adversarial contexts , where a snippet of text prepended to the prompt can degrade performance by up to 14%.

            "abstract": "Because\"out-of-the-box\"large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called\"jailbreaks\"against LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models, raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from producing objectionable information.

Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision? We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.",

In this adversarial cycle, the two models seek to outperform each other in the prompting phase, generating a dataset of rich examples which are then used for fine-tuning. This iterative application of prompting and fine-tuning allows continuous refinement and improved performance. The performance of our approach is evaluated through classification accuracy on a dataset consisting of problematic prompts not detected by GPT-4, as well as a selection of contentious but unproblematic prompts.

            "abstract": "While recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes, they are vulnerable to certain jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires finding adversarial prompts that cause such jailbreaking, e.g. by appending a suffix to a given instruction, which is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that can easily be detected by perplexity-based filters, may require gradient information from the TargetLLM, or do not scale well due to time-consuming discrete optimization processes over the token space. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called the AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds, $\\sim800\\times$ faster than existing optimization-based approaches. We train the AdvPrompter using a novel algorithm that does not require access to the gradients of the TargetLLM. This process alternates between two steps: (1) generating high-quality target adversarial suffixes by optimizing the AdvPrompter predictions, and (2) low-rank fine-tuning of the AdvPrompter with the generated adversarial suffixes. The trained AdvPrompter generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show state-of-the-art results on the AdvBench dataset, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLM APIs. Further, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset generated by AdvPrompter, LLMs can be made more robust against jailbreaking attacks while maintaining performance, i.e. high MMLU scores.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced tremendous popularity and are widely used from casual conversations to AI-driven programming. However, despite their considerable success, LLMs are not entirely reliable and can give detailed guidance on how to conduct harmful or illegal activities. While safety measures can reduce the risk of such outputs, adversarial jailbreak attacks can still exploit LLMs to produce harmful content. These jailbreak templates are typically manually crafted, making large-scale testing challenging. In this paper, we introduce GPTFuzz, a novel black-box jailbreak fuzzing framework inspired by the AFL fuzzing framework. Instead of manual engineering, GPTFuzz automates the generation of jailbreak templates for red-teaming LLMs. At its core, GPTFuzz starts with human-written templates as initial seeds, then mutates them to produce new templates. We detail three key components of GPTFuzz: a seed selection strategy for balancing efficiency and variability, mutate operators for creating semantically equivalent or similar sentences, and a judgment model to assess the success of a jailbreak attack. We evaluate GPTFuzz against various commercial and open-source LLMs, including ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Vicuna, under diverse attack scenarios. Our results indicate that GPTFuzz consistently produces jailbreak templates with a high success rate, surpassing human-crafted templates. Remarkably, GPTFuzz achieves over 90% attack success rates against ChatGPT and Llama-2 models, even with suboptimal initial seed templates. We anticipate that GPTFuzz will be instrumental for researchers and practitioners in examining LLM robustness and will encourage further exploration into enhancing LLM safety.",

However, adversarial prompts known as 'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate potentially harmful content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require optimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization or efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we propose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to generate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we analyze the failure of LLMs defense from the perspective of prompt execution priority, and propose corresponding defense strategies.

            "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are a serious threat to the reliable deployment of machine learning models in safety-critical applications. They can misguide current models to predict incorrectly by slightly modifying the inputs. Recently, substantial work has shown that adversarial examples tend to deviate from the underlying data manifold of normal examples, whereas pre-trained masked language models can fit the manifold of normal NLP data. To explore how to use the masked language model in adversarial detection, we propose a novel textual adversarial example detection method, namely Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), which can produce clearly distinguishable signals between normal examples and adversarial examples by exploring the changes in manifolds induced by the masked language model. MLMD features a plug and play usage (i.e., no need to retrain the victim model) for adversarial defense and it is agnostic to classification tasks, victim model\u2019s architectures, and to-be-defended attack methods. We evaluate MLMD on various benchmark textual datasets, widely studied machine learning models, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial attacks (in total 3*4*4 = 48 settings). Experimental results show that MLMD can achieve strong performance, with detection accuracy up to 0.984, 0.967, and 0.901 on AG-NEWS, IMDB, and SST-2 datasets, respectively. Additionally, MLMD is superior, or at least comparable to, the SOTA detection defenses in detection accuracy and F1 score. Among many defenses based on the off-manifold assumption of adversarial examples, this work offers a new angle for capturing the manifold change.

They are already being adopted in practice and integrated into many systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and search engines. The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting . Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed \ufb01ltering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following . So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM. In this work, we show that augmenting LLMs with retrieval and API calling capabilities (so-called Application-Integrated LLMs ) induces a whole new set of attack vectors. These LLMs might process poisoned content retrieved from the Web that contains malicious prompts pre-injected and selected by adversaries. We demonstrate that an attacker can indirectly perform such PI attacks. Based on this key insight, we systematically analyze the resulting threat landscape of Application-Integrated LLMs and discuss a variety of new attack vectors.

While incorporating demonstrations can greatly enhance the performance of LLMs across various tasks, it may introduce a new security concern: attackers can manipulate only the demonstrations without changing the input to perform an attack. In this paper, we investigate the security concern of ICL from an adversarial perspective, focusing on the impact of demonstrations. We propose a novel attack method named advICL, which aims to manipulate only the demonstration without changing the input to mislead the models. Our results demonstrate that as the number of demonstrations increases, the robustness of in-context learning would decrease. Additionally, we also identify the intrinsic property of the demonstrations is that they can be used (prepended) with different inputs. As a result, it introduces a more practical threat model in which an attacker can attack the test input example even without knowing and manipulating it. To achieve it, we propose the transferable version of advICL, named Transferable-advICL. Our experiment shows that the adversarial demonstration generated by Transferable-advICL can successfully attack the unseen test input examples. We hope that our study reveals the critical security risks associated with ICL and underscores the need for extensive research on the robustness of ICL, particularly given its increasing significance in the advancement of LLMs.",

In this paper, we show that these solutions may be too optimistic. We propose an interpretable adversarial attack, AutoDAN , that combines the strengths of both types of attacks. It automatically generates attack prompts that bypass perplexity-based filters while maintaining a high attack success rate like manual jailbreak attacks. These prompts are interpretable and diverse, exhibiting strategies commonly used in manual jailbreak attacks, and transfer better than their non-readable counterparts when using limited training data or a single proxy model. We also customize AutoDAN \u2019s objective to leak system prompts, another jailbreak application not addressed in the adversarial attack literature.

This procedure has produced massive gains on standard NLP benchmarks, but these models remain brittle, even to mild adversarial perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate surprising gains in adversarial robustness enjoyed by Model-tuning Via Prompts (MVP), an alternative method of adapting to downstream tasks. Rather than appending an MLP head to make output prediction, MVP appends a prompt template to the input, and makes prediction via text infilling/completion. Across 5 NLP datasets, 4 adversarial attacks, and 3 different models, MVP improves performance against adversarial substitutions by an average of 8% over standard methods and even outperforms adversarial training-based state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By combining MVP with adversarial training, we achieve further improvements in adversarial robustness while maintaining performance on unperturbed examples. Finally, we conduct ablations to investigate the mechanism underlying these gains. Notably, we find that the main causes of vulnerability of MLP-FT can be attributed to the misalignment between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, and the randomly initialized MLP parameters.",

On this basis, the Zero Sample Defender (ZDDR) is introduced for adversarial sample detection and recovery without relying on prior knowledge. ZDDR combines the log probability calculated by the model and the syntactic normative score of a large language model (LLM) to detect adversarial examples. Furthermore, using strategic prompts, ZDDR guides LLM in rephrasing adversarial content, maintaining clarity, structure, and meaning, thereby restoring the sentence from the attack. Benchmarking reveals a 9% improvement in area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for adversarial detection over existing techniques. Post-restoration, model classification efficacy surges by 45% compared to the offensive inputs, setting new performance standards against other restoration techniques.",

In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples.

We first show that the effectiveness of both adversarial attack and defense are sensitive to the used text prompt. Inspired by this, we propose a method to improve resilience to adversarial attacks by learning a robust text prompt for VLMs. The proposed method, named Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered prompts and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution shift and across datasets. Surprisingly, by simply adding one learned word to the prompts, APT can significantly boost the accuracy and robustness (epsilon=4/255) over the hand-engineered prompts by +13% and +8.5% on average respectively. The improvement further increases, in our most effective setting, to +26.4% for accuracy and +16.7% for robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/APT.",

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, many works trained neural networks to approximate either the intractable likelihood or the posterior directly. Most proposals use normalizing flows, namely neural networks parametrizing invertible maps used to transform samples from an underlying base measure; the probability density of the transformed samples is then accessible and the normalizing flow can be trained via maximum likelihood on simulated parameter-observation pairs. A recent work [Ramesh et al., 2022] approximated instead the posterior with generative networks, which drop the invertibility requirement and are thus a more flexible class of distributions scaling to high-dimensional and structured data. However, generative networks only allow sampling from the parametrized distribution; for this reason, Ramesh et al. [2022] follows the common solution of adversarial training, where the generative network plays a min-max game against a\"critic\"network. This procedure is unstable and can lead to a learned distribution underestimating the uncertainty - in extreme cases collapsing to a single point. Here, we propose to approximate the posterior with generative networks trained by Scoring Rule minimization, an overlooked adversarial-free method enabling smooth training and better uncertainty quantification. In simulation studies, the Scoring Rule approach yields better performances with shorter training time with respect to the adversarial framework.",

To bridge this gap, we propose Flow-GANs, a generative adversarial network for which we can perform exact likelihood evaluation, thus supporting both adversarial and maximum likelihood training. When trained adversarially, Flow-GANs generate high-quality samples but attain extremely poor log-likelihood scores, inferior even to a mixture model memorizing the training data; the opposite is true when trained by maximum likelihood.

It plays an important role in many domains such as network intrusion detection, criminal activity identity and so on. With the rapidly growing size of accessible training data and high computation capacities, deep learning based anomaly detection has become more and more popular. In this paper, a new domain-based anomaly detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) is proposed. Minimum likelihood regularization is proposed to make the generator produce more anomalies and prevent it from converging to normal data distribution. Proper ensemble of anomaly scores is shown to improve the stability of discriminator effectively.

            "abstract": "Generative models can be categorized into two types: explicit generative models that define explicit density forms and allow exact likelihood inference, such as score-based diffusion models (SDMs) and normalizing flows; implicit generative models that directly learn a transformation from the prior to the data distribution, such as generative adversarial nets (GANs). While these two types of models have shown great success, they suffer from respective limitations that hinder them from achieving fast sampling and high sample quality simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a unified theoretic framework for SDMs and GANs. We shown that: i) the learning dynamics of both SDMs and GANs can be described as a novel SDE named Discriminator Denoising Diffusion Flow (DiffFlow) where the drift can be determined by some weighted combinations of scores of the real data and the generated data; ii) By adjusting the relative weights between different score terms, we can obtain a smooth transition between SDMs and GANs while the marginal distribution of the SDE remains invariant to the change of the weights; iii) we prove the asymptotic optimality and maximal likelihood training scheme of the DiffFlow dynamics; iv) under our unified theoretic framework, we introduce several instantiations of the DiffFLow that provide new algorithms beyond GANs and SDMs with exact likelihood inference and have potential to achieve flexible trade-off between high sample quality and fast sampling speed.",

            "abstract": "Adversarial examples can expose the vulnerabilities of neural networks. State-of-the-art textual adversarial attacks have demonstrated their effectiveness in triggering errors in the output of natural language processing models. However, these attacks are limited to ensuring the semantic consistency between the adversarial example and the original input, increasing the possibility of the attacks being detected by human judges. In this paper, we propose a novel textual adversarial attack, Prompt-Attack, which aims to generate the adversarial examples having consistent semantics with the original input. Specifically, Prompt-Attack enhances the input's semantics with the prompts that represent the semantics of the different target segments extracted from the original input, to predict the substitutions having consistent semantics with the target segments. Then, it crafts the adversarial examples by replacing the important segments with their substitutions that can most affect the victim model's output. Besides, Prompt-Attack proposes a span-level segment identification strategy to extract more target segments from the input and a novel masking strategy to ensure the grammatical correctness of the generated adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate that Prompt-Attack significantly improves the semantic consistency score of the baseline attacks by an average of 48%. Further, Prompt-Attack achieves the best attack success rate of 0.906, showing an average improvement of 40% to the baselines. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that Prompt-Attack can achieve good performance in attacking different language models and Prompt-Attack is not sensitive to different settings.",

This paper sheds light on the security and safety implications of this trend. First, we underscore that the continuous and high-dimensional nature of the visual input makes it a weak link against adversarial attacks, representing an expanded attack surface of vision-integrated LLMs. Second, we highlight that the versatility of LLMs also presents visual attackers with a wider array of achievable adversarial objectives, extending the implications of security failures beyond mere misclassification. As an illustration, we present a case study in which we exploit visual adversarial examples to circumvent the safety guardrail of aligned LLMs with integrated vision. Intriguingly, we discover that a single visual adversarial example can universally jailbreak an aligned LLM, compelling it to heed a wide range of harmful instructions (that it otherwise would not) and generate harmful content that transcends the narrow scope of a `few-shot' derogatory corpus initially employed to optimize the adversarial example. Our study underscores the escalating adversarial risks associated with the pursuit of multimodality. Our findings also connect the long-studied adversarial vulnerabilities of neural networks to the nascent field of AI alignment. The presented attack suggests a fundamental adversarial challenge for AI alignment, especially in light of the emerging trend toward multimodality in frontier foundation models.",

However, numerous feature engineering based methods suffer from a limitation in mining behavioral semantic information, thus impeding the accuracy and efficiency of Android malware detection. Besides, the majority of existing feature engineering based methods are weakly interpretive and fail to furnish researchers with effective and readable detection reports. Inspired by the success of the Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding, we propose AppPoet, a LLM-assisted multi-view system for Android malware detection. Firstly, AppPoet employs a static method to comprehensively collect application features and formulate various observation views. Subsequently, it steers the LLM to produce function descriptions and behavioral summaries for views via our meticulously devised multi-view prompt engineering technique to realize the deep mining of view semantics. Finally, we collaboratively fuse the multi-view information to efficiently and accurately detect malware through a deep neural network (DNN) classifier and then generate the heuristic diagnostic reports. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a detection accuracy of 97.15% and an F1 score of 97.21%, which is superior to the baseline method Drebin and its variant.

To address this challenge, we first analyze the effectiveness of inducing attacks on ChatGPT. Then, two effective mitigating mechanisms are proposed.

In this paper, we propose to generate Prompt-based adversarial texts via Variable Neighborhood Search (P-VNS), which achieves a high attack success ratio while simulta-neously keeping text fluency and semantic similarity. Specifically, the well-designed prompt texts are constructed for input texts and the substitute words are obtained by mask-and-filling procedure under the effect of prompt texts, so the text fluency and semantic similarity can be enhanced. Additionally, the word modification priority is adaptively determined by employing the variable neighborhood search algorithm, yielding an improvement in the attack success ratio.

They have billions of parameters and are typically considered as black boxes. Robustness of huge Transformer-based models for NLP is an important question due to their wide adoption. One way to understand and improve robustness of these models is an exploration of an adversarial attack scenario: check if a small perturbation of an input invisible to a human eye can fool a model. Due to the discrete nature of textual data, gradient-based adversarial methods, widely used in computer vision, are not applicable per se. The standard strategy to overcome this issue is to develop token-level transformations, which do not take the whole sentence into account. In this paper, we propose a new black-box sentence-level attack. Our method fine-tunes a pre-trained language model to generate adversarial examples. A proposed differentiable loss function depends on a substitute classifier score and an approximate edit distance computed via a deep learning model. We show that the proposed attack outperforms competitors on a diverse set of NLP problems for both computed metrics and human evaluation. Moreover, due to the usage of the fine-tuned language model, the generated adversarial examples are hard to detect, thus current models are not robust.

This paper takes the lead to study open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) for intent detection, which brings the advantage of improved generalization to unseen domains. OCDA for intent detection is indeed a more realistic domain adaptation setting, which learns an intent classifier from labeled source domains and adapts it to unlabeled compound target domains containing different intent classes with the source domains. At inference time, we test the intent classifier in open domains that contain previously unseen intent classes. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Meta Prompt Tuning method (called AMPT) for open compound domain adaptive intent detection. Concretely, we propose a meta prompt tuning method, which utilizes language prompts to elicit rich knowledge from large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) and automatically finds better prompt initialization that facilitates fast adaptation via meta learning. Furthermore, we leverage a domain adversarial training technique to acquire domain-invariant representations of diverse domains. By taking advantage of the collaborative effect of meta learning, prompt tuning, and adversarial training, we can learn an intent classifier that can effectively generalize to unseen open domains. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets (i.e., HWU64 and CLINC) show that our model can learn substantially better-generalized representations for unseen domains compared with strong competitors.",

            "abstract": "The vulnerability of deep-learning-based image classification models to erroneous conclusions in the presence of small perturbations crafted by attackers has prompted attention to the question of the models\u2019 robustness level. However, the question of how to comprehensively and fairly measure the adversarial robustness of models with different structures and defenses as well as the performance of different attack methods has never been accurately answered. In this work, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Canary, a platform that aims to answer this question. Canary uses a common scoring framework that includes 4 dimensions with 26 (sub)metrics for evaluation. First, Canary generates and selects valid adversarial examples and collects metrics data through a series of tests. Then it uses a two-way evaluation strategy to guide the data organization and finally integrates all the data to give the scores for model robustness and attack effectiveness. In this process, we use Item Response Theory (IRT) for the first time to ensure that all the metrics can be fairly calculated into a score that can visually measure the capability. In order to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of Canary, we conducted large-scale testing of 15 representative models trained on the ImageNet dataset using 12 white-box attacks and 12 black-box attacks and came up with a series of in-depth and interesting findings. This further illustrates the capabilities and strengths of Canary as a benchmarking platform. Our paper provides an open-source framework for model robustness evaluation, allowing researchers to perform comprehensive and rapid evaluations of models or attack/defense algorithms, thus inspiring further improvements and greatly benefiting future work.",

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.",

DL-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms are severely threatened by adversarial attacks. In real-world, black-box adversarial attacks, the adversary needs to submit many highly-similar queries before drafting an adversarial example. Due to this long process, in-progress attack detection can play a significant role in adversarial defense in DL-based NLP algorithms. Although there are several approaches for detecting adversarial attacks in NLP, these approaches are reactive in the sense that they can detect adversarial examples only when they are fabricated and fed into the algorithm. In this study, we take one step towards proactive detection of adversarial attacks in NLP systems by proposing a robust, history-based model named Stateful Query Analysis (SQA) to identify suspiciously-similar sequences of queries capable of generating textual adversarial examples to which we refer by adversarial scenarios.

Also, it is widely applied to handle enormous sub-tasks of NLP. The current methods mainly use BERT and other powerful deep learning components to extract the semantic information of sentences from complex texts. Then, they perform sequence labeling to identify entity information. However, such methods usually encounter the problem of overfitting. Moreover, those methods always show poor performance in generalization ability and robustness. Compared with such methods, to extract effective entities, we propose a named entity recognition model based on adversarial training. For the encoding layer, we present Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT) as the pre-trained language model to get the word vector to enrich the semantic representation. After combining the word vector obtained by BERT and the word vector obtained by the glove, we investigate a method of Bi-LSTM in the feature extraction layer for training to adapt to the disturbance and recognize the named entity. Our core innovation is introducing the Fast Gradient Method (FGM) to generate adversarial examples for the adversarial attack. The adversarial attack would add disturbance data to the encoding layer. In this way, we successfully strengthen the abilities of both generalization and robustness, thereby improving the model's performance. We conduct experiments on widely used NER datasets on Chinese Resume NER for the model we proposed. Additionally, the experimental results show that our model has achieved some comparable results on recognizing named entities.

However, most biomedical pre-trained language models rely on the traditional masked language model (MLM) pre-training strategy, which cannot fully capture the semantic relations of context. It is challenging to learn biomedical knowledge via language models in the Chinese biomedical fields due to the lack of training resources and the extreme complexity and diversity of Chinese medical terminologies. To this end, we propose MedBERT-adv, which utilizes a biomedical knowledge infusion method that can effectively complement BERT-like models. Instead of using time-consuming medical expert annotation and inaccurate automatic annotation, we use the article structure in Baidu Encyclopedia as a weakly supervised signal, utilizing each medical term and its category as labels to pre-train the model. We also leverage adversarial training strategies like FGM for fine-tuning downstream tasks to further improve the performance of MedBERT-adv. We experimented with MedBERT-adv on the Chinese biomedical dataset CBLUE using eight NLP tasks.

In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) when paired with recent adaptation methods for universal deepfake detection. Following previous studies in this domain, we employ only a single dataset (ProGAN) in order to adapt CLIP for deepfake detection. However, in contrast to prior research, which rely solely on the visual part of CLIP while ignoring its textual component, our analysis reveals that retaining the text part is crucial. Consequently, the simple and lightweight Prompt Tuning based adaptation strategy that we employ outperforms the previous SOTA approach by 5.01% mAP and 6.61% accuracy while utilizing less than one third of the training data (200k images as compared to 720k). To assess the real-world applicability of our proposed models, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation across various scenarios.

However, finding a correct mode in the high-dimensional distribution produced by the diffusion model is challenging and often leads to issues such as over-saturation, over-smoothing, and Janus-like artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm for 3D synthesis that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models. Instead of focusing on mode-seeking, our method directly models the distribution discrepancy between multi-view renderings and diffusion priors in an adversarial manner, which unlocks the generation of high-fidelity and photorealistic 3D content, conditioned on a single image and prompt. Moreover, by harnessing the latent space of GANs and expressive diffusion model priors, our method facilitates a wide variety of 3D applications including single-view reconstruction, high diversity generation and continuous 3D interpolation in the open domain.

            "abstract": "Contextualized or discourse aware commonsense inference is the task of generating coherent commonsense assertions (i.e., facts) from a given story, and a particular sentence from that story. Some problems with the task are: lack of controllability for topics of the inferred facts; lack of commonsense knowledge during training; and, possibly, hallucinated or false facts. In this work, we utilize a transformer model for this task and develop techniques to address the aforementioned problems in the task. We control the inference by introducing a new technique we call\"hinting\". Hinting is a kind of language model prompting, that utilizes both hard prompts (specific words) and soft prompts (virtual learnable templates). This serves as a control signal to advise the language model\"what to talk about\". Next, we establish a methodology for performing joint inference with multiple commonsense knowledge bases. Joint inference of commonsense requires care, because it is imprecise and the level of generality is more flexible. You want to be sure that the results\"still make sense\"for the context. To this end, we align the textual version of assertions from three knowledge graphs (ConceptNet, ATOMIC2020, and GLUCOSE) with a story and a target sentence. This combination allows us to train a single model to perform joint inference with multiple knowledge graphs. We show experimental results for the three knowledge graphs on joint inference. Our final contribution is exploring a GAN architecture that generates the contextualized commonsense assertions and scores them as to their plausibility through a discriminator. The result is an integrated system for contextual commonsense inference in stories, that can controllably generate plausible commonsense assertions, and takes advantage of joint inference between multiple commonsense knowledge bases.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the quantum effect on machine learning (ML) models exemplified by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which is a promising deep learning framework. In the general GAN framework the generator maps uniform noise to a fake image. In this study, we utilize the Associative Adversarial Network (AAN), which consists of a standard GAN and an associative memory. Further, we set a Boltzmann Machine (BM), which is an undirected graphical model that learns low-dimensional features extracted from a discriminator, as the memory. Owing to difficulty calculating the BM's log-likelihood gradient, it is necessary to approximate it by using the sample mean obtained from the BM, which has tentative parameters. To calculate the sample mean, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is often used. In a previous study, this was performed using a quantum annealer device, and the performance of the\"Quantum\"AAN was compared to that of the standard GAN. However, its better performance than the standard GAN is not well understood. In this study, we introduce two methods to draw samples: classical sampling via MCMC and quantum sampling via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, which is quantum simulation on the classical computer. Then, we compare these methods to investigate whether quantum sampling is advantageous. Specifically, calculating the discriminator loss, the generator loss, inception score and Fr\\'echet inception distance, we discuss the possibility of AAN. We show that the AANs trained by both MCMC and QMC are more stable during training and produce more varied images than the standard GANs. However, the results indicate no difference in sampling by QMC simulation compared to that by MCMC.",

The paper includes both an analysis of the test as well as its empirical evaluation. The analysis provides an expression for the approximate lower bound of the detection probability, and the empirical evaluation shows this approximation to be similar to the actual detection probability. Since the LO-GLRT requires the score function of the input distribution, which is usually unknown in practice, we study the LO-GLRT for a learned surrogate input distribution. Specifically, we use a Gaussian distribution over the input subvectors as the surrogate distribution, for its mathematical tractability and computational efficiency. We evaluate the detector for several popular image classifiers and datasets, and compare the statistical and computational performance with the perturbation rectifying network (PRN) detector, another successful approach for detecting the UAPs. The LO-GLRT outperforms the PRN detector on both counts, with a running time at least 100 times lower than that of the PRN detector.",

Attributed to the superior ability in code representation, they have been further applied in multiple downstream tasks such as clone detection, code search and code translation. However, it is also observed that these state-of-the-art pre-trained models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. The performance of these pre-trained models drops significantly with simple perturbations such as renaming variable names. This weakness may be inherited by their downstream models and thereby amplified at an unprecedented scale. To this end, we propose an approach namely ContraBERT that aims to improve the robustness of pre-trained models via contrastive learning. Specifically, we design nine kinds of simple and complex data augmentation operators on the programming language (PL) and natural language (NL) data to construct different variants. Furthermore, we continue to train the existing pre-trained models by masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive pre-training task on the original samples with their augmented variants to enhance the robustness of the model. The extensive ex-periments demonstrate that ContraBERT can effectively improve the robustness of the existing pre-trained models. Further study also confirms that these robustness-enhanced models provide improvements as compared to original models over four popular downstream tasks.",

This study aims to apply, evaluate, and compare advanced natural language processing techniques for identifying signs of cognitive decline in clinical notes. Methods: This study, conducted at Mass General Brigham (MGB), Boston, MA, included clinical notes from the 4 years prior to initial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis in 2019 for patients [\u2265] 50 years. Note sections regarding cognitive decline were labeled manually. A random sample of 4,949 note sections filtered with cognitive functions-related keywords were used for traditional AI model development, and 200 random subset were used for LLM and prompt development; another random sample of 1996 note sections without keyword filtering were used for testing. Prompt templates for large language models (LLM), Llama 2 on Amazon Web Service and GPT-4 on Microsoft Azure, were developed with multiple prompting approaches to select the optimal LLM-based method. Baseline comparisons were made with XGBoost and a hierarchical attention-based deep neural network model. An ensemble of the three models was then constructed using majority vote. Results: GPT-4 demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency to Llama 2. The ensemble model outperformed individual models, achieving a precision of 90.3%, recall of 94.2%, and F1-score of 92.2%. Notably, the ensemble model demonstrated a marked improvement in precision (from a 70%-79% range to above 90%) compared to the best performing single model. Error analysis revealed 63 samples were wrongly predicted by at least one model; however, only 2 cases (3.2%) were mutual errors across all models, indicating diverse error profiles among them. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that LLMs and traditional models exhibit diverse error profiles. The ensemble of LLMs and locally trained machine learning models on EHR data was found to be complementary, enhancing performance and improving diagnostic accuracy.",
