    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Adversarial prompts can manipulate large language models to generate harmful, biased, or factually incorrect outputs. Detecting these malicious prompts is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of language model applications.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for detecting adversarial prompts often rely on handcrafted rules, heuristics, or supervised learning approaches that require labeled examples of adversarial prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Language models themselves can be leveraged to detect anomalous or adversarial prompts by assessing their likelihood under the model's learned distribution. Prompts that are significantly less likely than benign prompts can be flagged as potentially adversarial.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a novel approach for adversarial prompt detection that utilizes the language model itself as a scoring function. Given a prompt, we calculate its likelihood under the language model and compare it to a threshold derived from the likelihoods of a set of known benign prompts. If the prompt's likelihood falls below the threshold, it is flagged as potentially adversarial. To improve the detector's robustness, we also employ techniques such as temperature scaling and ensembling multiple language models. Furthermore, we investigate the use of contrastive learning to train the language model to assign higher likelihoods to benign prompts and lower likelihoods to adversarial ones.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on existing adversarial prompt datasets and compare its performance with baseline detection approaches. Conduct a series of experiments to assess the impact of various factors, such as the choice of language model, likelihood threshold, and contrastive learning techniques. Additionally, analyze the method's ability to generalize to new types of adversarial prompts and its robustness to adaptive attacks."

        "Title": "Leveraging Language Models for Adversarial Prompt Detection via Likelihood Scoring",
        "Problem Statement": "Adversarial prompts can manipulate large language models to generate harmful, biased, or factually incorrect outputs. Detecting these malicious prompts is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of language model applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for detecting adversarial prompts often rely on handcrafted rules, heuristics, or supervised learning approaches that require labeled examples of adversarial prompts. However, language models themselves can be leveraged to detect anomalous or adversarial prompts by assessing their likelihood under the model's learned distribution. Prompts that are significantly less likely than benign prompts can be flagged as potentially adversarial. This approach eliminates the need for manually curated rules or labeled examples and directly utilizes the language model's inherent knowledge.",
        "Proposed Method": {
            "Step 1: Likelihood Scoring": "Given a prompt, calculate its likelihood under the language model. This can be done by computing the perplexity or the average log-likelihood of the prompt tokens.",
            "Step 2: Threshold Determination": "Determine a likelihood threshold based on a set of known benign prompts. Prompts with likelihoods significantly lower than the threshold are considered potentially adversarial.",
            "Step 3: Temperature Scaling": "To improve the detector's robustness, apply temperature scaling to the language model's output probabilities before calculating the likelihood scores. This helps to calibrate the model's confidence estimates.",
            "Step 4: Ensemble Modeling": "Combine the likelihood scores from multiple language models to reduce the impact of model-specific biases and improve detection accuracy.",
            "Step 5: Contrastive Learning": "Fine-tune the language models using contrastive learning to assign higher likelihoods to benign prompts and lower likelihoods to adversarial prompts. This can be done by constructing positive and negative prompt pairs and optimizing the model to maximize the likelihood difference between them."

This may involve examining the language models' behavior, the quality of the training data, or the threshold selection process.\n2. Explore alternative scoring methods, such as using the KL divergence between the prompt's token distribution and a reference distribution derived from benign prompts.\n3. Investigate the use of anomaly detection techniques, such as one-class classification or density estimation, to identify adversarial prompts that deviate from the normal patterns of benign prompts.\n4. Collect a larger and more diverse dataset of adversarial prompts to improve the detector's robustness and generalization ability.\n5. Consider incorporating additional features beyond likelihood scores, such as semantic similarity measures or linguistic properties, to enhance the detection accuracy.\n6. If the performance remains unsatisfactory, pivot the project towards an analysis of the challenges and limitations of detecting adversarial prompts using language models. This can involve conducting experiments to understand the factors that contribute to the difficulty of the task and proposing potential research directions for future work."
