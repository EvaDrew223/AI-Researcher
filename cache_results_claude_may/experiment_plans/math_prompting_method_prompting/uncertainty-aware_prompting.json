    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models can often generate overly confident solutions to mathematical problems, even when they are uncertain or lack sufficient information. This can lead to incorrect answers and a lack of transparency about the model's limitations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing prompting methods typically focus on generating a single, deterministic solution, without explicitly representing the model's uncertainty or confidence in its reasoning steps.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often reason about complex problems by considering multiple possibilities, assessing their confidence in each step, and acknowledging when they are uncertain or need more information. By prompting LLMs to engage in similar uncertainty-aware reasoning, we can improve the transparency and reliability of their mathematical problem-solving abilities.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Prompting (UAP), a method that guides LLMs to reason about mathematical problems while explicitly representing and communicating their uncertainty. The prompt includes instructions like: '1) For each step of your reasoning process, generate multiple candidate solutions and assess your confidence in each one. 2) If your confidence in a step is below a threshold, indicate that you are uncertain and may need additional information. 3) Propagate uncertainty throughout the reasoning process, and provide a final answer along with a confidence score. 4) If the overall confidence is low, suggest what additional information might be needed to solve the problem more reliably.' By explicitly representing and communicating uncertainty, UAP can improve the transparency and reliability of the LLM's mathematical problem-solving performance.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UAP on mathematical reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH, comparing its performance and calibration to deterministic prompting baselines. We will measure metrics like accuracy, confidence calibration, and the frequency of 'uncertain' responses. We will also conduct user studies to assess the perceived transparency and trustworthiness of UAP's uncertainty-aware reasoning. Additionally, we will analyze the relationship between the model's confidence scores and the accuracy of its generated solutions."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate UAP on mathematical reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH. These datasets contain a diverse set of mathematical problems that require multi-step reasoning and problem-solving skills.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We will compare UAP to two baseline prompting methods: 1) Direct prompting, where the model is simply asked to solve the problem, and 2) Chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is prompted to generate a step-by-step reasoning process. For UAP, we will design prompts that instruct the model to generate multiple candidate solutions for each reasoning step, assess its confidence in each one, propagate uncertainty throughout the reasoning process, and provide a final answer with a confidence score. Example UAP prompt: 'For each step of your reasoning process, generate three candidate solutions and give a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each. If your confidence in a step is below 0.7, indicate that you are uncertain and may need more information. Propagate uncertainty by multiplying confidence scores across steps. Provide your final answer along with an overall confidence score. If the overall confidence is below 0.5, suggest what additional information might help solve the problem more reliably.'",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will evaluate UAP on GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 models from OpenAI. These models have demonstrated strong performance on mathematical reasoning tasks and are widely used in research and applications.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each problem in the GSM8K and MATH datasets, we will generate solutions using the baseline prompting methods and UAP. We will record the model's final answer, confidence score (for UAP), and the generated reasoning process (for chain-of-thought and UAP).",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will compare the performance of UAP to the baseline methods using the following metrics: 1) Accuracy: the percentage of problems correctly solved, 2) Confidence calibration: the alignment between the model's confidence scores and its accuracy (e.g., using Brier score or expected calibration error), 3) Uncertainty frequency: the percentage of problems where the model expresses uncertainty or requests additional information, and 4) Reasoning quality: manual evaluation of the generated reasoning processes for a subset of problems. We will also conduct error analysis to identify common failure modes and areas for improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Ava has 10 apples. She gives 3 apples to Ben and 2 apples to Claire. How many apples does Ava have left?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Ava has 5 apples left.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Ava has 10 apples. She gives 3 apples to Ben and 2 apples to Claire. How many apples does Ava have left? Let's solve this step by step:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Given:\n- Ava starts with 10 apples\n- She gives 3 apples to Ben\n- She gives 2 apples to Claire\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of apples Ava gives away\nApples given away = Apples given to Ben + Apples given to Claire\n                  = 3 + 2\n                  = 5\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of apples Ava has left\nApples left = Starting apples - Apples given away\n            = 10 - 5\n            = 5\n\nTherefore, Ava has 5 apples left.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Uncertainty-Aware Prompting)": "Ava has 10 apples. She gives some apples to Ben and some apples to Claire. How many apples does Ava have left? For each step of your reasoning process, generate three candidate solutions and give a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each. If your confidence in a step is below 0.7, indicate that you are uncertain and may need more information. Propagate uncertainty by multiplying confidence scores across steps. Provide your final answer along with an overall confidence score. If the overall confidence is below 0.5, suggest what additional information might help solve the problem more reliably.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Uncertainty-Aware Prompting)": "Step 1: Determine the number of apples Ava gives to Ben and Claire\nCandidate solutions:\n1) Ava gives 3 apples to Ben and 2 apples to Claire (confidence: 0.2)\n2) Ava gives 4 apples to Ben and 3 apples to Claire (confidence: 0.3)\n3) The problem does not specify the exact number of apples given (confidence: 0.9)\n\nI am uncertain about the number of apples Ava gives to Ben and Claire. The problem statement does not provide this information.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of apples Ava has left\nCandidate solutions:\n1) Ava has 5 apples left (confidence: 0.2)\n2) Ava has 3 apples left (confidence: 0.3)\n3) Cannot determine the number of apples left without knowing how many were given away (confidence: 0.9)\n\nI am uncertain about the number of apples Ava has left because the number of apples given away is unknown.\n\nFinal answer: There is not enough information to determine how many apples Ava has left (confidence: 0.9).\n\nAdditional information needed: The problem should specify the exact number of apples Ava gives to Ben and Claire in order to calculate how many apples she has left.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed UAP method prompts the model to express its uncertainty about the number of apples given away and the final answer, as this information is not provided in the problem statement. The model generates multiple candidate solutions for each step, assigns confidence scores, and propagates uncertainty throughout the reasoning process. In contrast, the baseline methods (direct prompting and chain-of-thought prompting) generate a single, overconfident solution without acknowledging the lack of sufficient information. UAP improves the transparency and reliability of the model's output by explicitly communicating its uncertainty and identifying the additional information needed to solve the problem."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UAP method does not significantly improve performance over the baselines, we can conduct additional analyses to understand why. For example, we can: 1) Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated candidate solutions and confidence scores for each reasoning step, 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of the uncertainty propagation mechanism and threshold values, 3) Investigate the relationship between the model's confidence scores and the accuracy of its generated solutions, and 4) Conduct user studies to assess the perceived transparency and trustworthiness of UAP's uncertainty-aware reasoning compared to the baselines. Based on these analyses, we can propose modifications to the UAP prompting strategy, such as adjusting the instructions for generating candidate solutions, refining the confidence scoring and propagation mechanisms, or incorporating additional prompts to guide the model's reasoning process. If the UAP method still does not yield satisfactory results after these modifications, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of current prompting methods for mathematical problem-solving and proposing alternative approaches based on the insights gained from the UAP experiments."
