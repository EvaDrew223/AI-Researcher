        "Title": "Adversarial Reasoning Prompting: Improving Mathematical Problem Solving in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks that involve complex problem-solving strategies and are prone to errors.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to improve mathematical reasoning in large language models, such as chain-of-thought prompting, program-aided language models, and self-consistency techniques, have shown promising results but still face limitations. These methods often rely on external resources or require extensive fine-tuning, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Inspired by the success of adversarial training in improving the robustness and generalization of machine learning models, we hypothesize that introducing an adversarial component during the reasoning process can help large language models identify and correct their mistakes, leading to improved problem-solving performance. By leveraging the model's own knowledge and reasoning capabilities, we aim to develop a more efficient and effective approach to enhance mathematical reasoning in large language models.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will evaluate ARP on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as MATH, GSM8K, and AQuA. These datasets cover a wide range of mathematical problems and require complex reasoning skills.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "We will compare the proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines, including chain-of-thought prompting and program-aided language models. These baselines will serve as a reference to assess the effectiveness of ARP.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Design": "We will design a set of prompts for each stage of the ARP method:\na. Problem Solving Prompt: A standard prompt that encourages the model to generate a step-by-step solution to the mathematical problem.\nb. Adversarial Critique Prompt: A prompt that challenges the generated solution by asking the model to identify potential flaws, inconsistencies, or alternative approaches. For example: \"Critically analyze the given solution. Are there any errors, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement? Provide constructive feedback.\"\nc.

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Solve the following problem step-by-step:\nIf 3x + 2y = 14 and x + y = 5, what is the value of x?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)": "Step 1: Solve for y in the equation x + y = 5.\ny = 5 - x\n\nStep 2: Substitute y = 5 - x into the equation 3x + 2y = 14.\n3x + 2(5 - x) = 14\n3x + 10 - 2x = 14\nx + 10 = 14\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 4.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Adversarial Reasoning Prompting - Problem Solving)": "Solve the following problem step-by-step:\nIf 3x + 2y = 14 and x + y = 5, what is the value of x?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Adversarial Reasoning Prompting - Problem Solving)": "Step 1: Solve for y in the equation x + y = 5.\ny = 5 - x\n\nStep 2: Substitute y = 5 - x into the equation 3x + 2y = 14.\n3x + 2(5 - x) = 14\n3x + 10 - 2x = 14\nx + 10 = 14\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 4.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Adversarial Reasoning Prompting - Adversarial Critique)": "Critically analyze the given solution. Are there any errors, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement? Provide constructive feedback.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Adversarial Reasoning Prompting - Adversarial Critique)": "The solution is correct and follows a logical step-by-step approach. However, there is an alternative method that could be used to solve the problem more efficiently:\n\nInstead of solving for y first, we can substitute the equation x + y = 5 directly into the equation 3x + 2y = 14. This would eliminate the need for the substitution step and simplify the problem-solving process.\n\nHere's how the alternative solution would look:\n\nStep 1: Substitute x + y = 5 into the equation 3x + 2y = 14.\n3x + 2(5 - x) = 14\n3x + 10 - 2x = 14\nx + 10 = 14\nx = 4\n\nThis alternative approach reduces the number of steps required to solve the problem and may be more intuitive for some students.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Adversarial Reasoning Prompting - Refinement)": "Based on the provided feedback, refine the solution to address the identified issues and generate an improved answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Adversarial Reasoning Prompting - Refinement)": "Here's an alternative solution that incorporates the feedback:\n\nStep 1: Substitute x + y = 5 into the equation 3x + 2y = 14.\n3x + 2(5 - x) = 14\n3x + 10 - 2x = 14\nx + 10 = 14\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 4.\n\nThis refined solution simplifies the problem-solving process by directly substituting the equation x + y = 5 into the equation 3x + 2y = 14, eliminating the need for the additional substitution step. The result remains the same, with x = 4.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline chain-of-thought prompting generates a correct solution but may not always provide the most efficient approach. The adversarial reasoning prompting method identifies an alternative solution that simplifies the problem-solving process. By incorporating the adversarial feedback, the refined solution presents a more streamlined approach while still arriving at the correct answer. This demonstrates the potential of adversarial reasoning prompting in improving the efficiency and clarity of the model's problem-solving capabilities."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Adversarial Reasoning Prompting method does not yield significant improvements over the baselines, we will consider the following alternative plans:\n\n1. Analyze the quality of the adversarial critiques: We will examine the generated adversarial critiques to assess their relevance, coherence, and effectiveness in identifying potential flaws or alternative approaches. This analysis will help us understand whether the adversarial component is providing meaningful feedback to the model.\n\n2. Investigate the impact of prompt variations: We will explore different variations of the adversarial critique and refinement prompts to determine if the phrasing or structure of the prompts influences the model's ability to generate effective critiques and incorporate feedback. This investigation will help optimize the prompt design for better performance.\n\n3. Evaluate the model's reasoning capabilities: We will conduct a detailed analysis of the model's reasoning steps to identify any limitations or weaknesses in its problem-solving approach. This analysis will provide insights into potential areas for improvement, such as incorporating additional problem-solving strategies or enhancing the model's understanding of mathematical concepts.\n\n4. Explore alternative adversarial techniques: If the current adversarial reasoning prompting approach does not yield satisfactory results, we will investigate alternative adversarial techniques, such as generating multiple critiques from different perspectives or using a separate model as the adversarial critic. These techniques may provide more diverse and effective feedback to improve the model's reasoning capabilities.\n\n5. Consider domain-specific adaptations: We will explore adapting the adversarial reasoning prompting method to specific mathematical domains or problem types. By tailoring the prompts and adversarial techniques to the characteristics of different domains, we may be able to improve the model's performance on specific types of mathematical problems.\n\nIf the proposed method and the alternative plans do not lead to significant improvements, we will focus on conducting an in-depth analysis of the model's reasoning process and the challenges encountered during the problem-solving tasks. This analysis will aim to provide valuable insights into the limitations of current language models in mathematical reasoning and highlight potential directions for future research. The findings can be presented as an analysis paper, contributing to the understanding of language models' capabilities and informing the development of more effective approaches for enhancing mathematical problem-solving in large language models."
