        "Problem": "Solving complex mathematical problems requires extensive domain knowledge and problem-solving strategies. While large language models have been trained on broad mathematical content, their knowledge is often incomplete and unreliable for niche topics and novel problem types.",
        "Existing Methods": "Prior work has used hand-crafted problem/solution prompts to elicit mathematical knowledge from language models. However, these methods are limited by the diversity and quality of the manually created data.",
        "Motivation": "We hypothesize that language models can be prompted to generate their own high-quality mathematical problems and solutions, which can then be used to improve their problem-solving abilities in a self-supervised manner. By generating a large volume of diverse problems and solutions, the model can learn more robust and generalizable problem-solving strategies.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Unsupervised Data Generation Prompting (UDGP), where we prompt the model to generate novel mathematical problems and corresponding step-by-step solutions. The prompts include instructions to generate problems with specific characteristics (e.g., multiple calculation steps, requiring a particular problem-solving technique, based on a certain mathematical concept). The model is prompted to ensure that each generated problem is well-posed and has a unique correct solution. The generated problem/solution pairs are then used as additional training data to improve the model's mathematical problem-solving abilities.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UDGP by using it to generate a large dataset of mathematical problems and solutions, then fine-tuning the language model on this generated data. We will measure the model's problem-solving accuracy on the MATH and GSM8K benchmarks before and after fine-tuning. We will compare to baselines that use manually created training data or no additional fine-tuning. We will also evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated problems and solutions using human ratings and automated metrics."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Prepare Datasets": "We will use the MATH and GSM8K datasets as the evaluation benchmarks. These datasets contain complex mathematical problems that require multiple steps to solve. We will split each dataset into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Design UDGP Prompts": "We will design a set of prompts for generating mathematical problems and solutions. The prompts will include instructions for generating problems with specific characteristics, such as:\n- Generate a problem that requires multiple calculation steps to solve.\n- Generate a problem that can be solved using the substitution method.\n- Generate a problem based on the concept of trigonometric identities.\nWe will also include prompts to ensure the generated problems are well-posed and have unique solutions, such as:\n- Ensure the problem statement provides all necessary information to solve the problem.\n- Verify that the problem has a single correct solution.\n- Provide a step-by-step solution to the generated problem.",
            "Step 3: Generate Problem/Solution Pairs": "We will use the designed prompts to generate a large dataset of mathematical problems and corresponding solutions. We will use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models for generation. The generated data will be filtered to remove any invalid or duplicate problems.",
            "Step 4: Fine-Tune Models": "We will fine-tune the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models on the generated problem/solution pairs. We will use the training split of the generated data for fine-tuning and the validation split for model selection. The fine-tuning objective will be to minimize the perplexity of the model on the generated data.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Problem-Solving Performance": "We will evaluate the problem-solving performance of the fine-tuned models on the test splits of the MATH and GSM8K datasets. We will compare the accuracy of the fine-tuned models with the following baselines:\n- The original GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models without fine-tuning.\n- Models fine-tuned on manually created problem/solution prompts.\n- Models fine-tuned on the training splits of the MATH and GSM8K datasets.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Generated Data Quality": "We will analyze the quality and diversity of the generated problem/solution pairs. We will use human ratings to assess the following aspects:\n- Problem validity: Is the problem statement well-posed and solvable?\n- Solution correctness: Is the provided solution correct and complete?\n- Problem diversity: How diverse are the generated problems in terms of difficulty, required techniques, and mathematical concepts?\nWe will also use automated metrics, such as n-gram diversity and topic modeling, to quantify the diversity of the generated data."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Solve the following problem:\nIf 3x + 5 = 20, what is the value of 6x + 10?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "To solve for 6x + 10, we first need to solve for x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20.\n\n3x + 5 = 20\n3x = 15\nx = 5\n\nNow that we know x = 5, we can substitute this value into the expression 6x + 10:\n\n6x + 10 = 6(5) + 10\n        = 30 + 10\n        = 40\n\nTherefore, the value of 6x + 10 is 40.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Generate a mathematical problem that requires multiple calculation steps to solve. Ensure the problem statement provides all necessary information to solve the problem. Verify that the problem has a single correct solution. Provide a step-by-step solution to the generated problem.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Problem: The length of a rectangle is 3 units more than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 26 units, find its area.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\nLet the width of the rectangle be x units.\nThen, the length of the rectangle is (2x + 3) units.\n\nPerimeter of the rectangle = 2(length + width)\n26 = 2(2x + 3 + x)\n26 = 2(3x + 3)\n26 = 6x + 6\n20 = 6x\nx = 20/6\nx = 10/3\n\nWidth of the rectangle = 10/3 units\nLength of the rectangle = 2(10/3) + 3 = 20/3 + 9/3 = 29/3 units\n\nArea of the rectangle = length \u00d7 width\n                      = (29/3) \u00d7 (10/3)\n                      = 290/9\n                      = 32.22 square units (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is approximately 32.22 square units.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed UDGP method generates a novel problem that requires multiple calculation steps and provides a complete solution. The generated problem is well-posed, has a unique solution, and covers concepts like perimeter and area of rectangles. In contrast, the baseline prompt only tests a specific problem-solving skill (substitution) and does not generate new problems."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UDGP method does not improve the problem-solving performance of the models, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality of the generated problems and solutions to identify potential issues, such as lack of diversity, incorrect solutions, or ill-posed problems. Based on the analysis, refine the prompts to address the identified issues.\n2. Experiment with different fine-tuning strategies, such as curriculum learning (starting with easier problems and gradually increasing difficulty) or meta-learning (learning to adapt to new problem types).\n3. Investigate the impact of problem/solution representation on model performance. For example, we can explore different ways of representing mathematical equations, such as using LaTeX or MathML, and assess their effect on the model's understanding and generation of mathematical content.\n4. Conduct a thorough error analysis to understand the types of mistakes made by the models and their underlying causes. This can help identify the limitations of the current approach and guide the development of new methods to address them.\nIf the UDGP method consistently underperforms the baselines, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the challenges and limitations of unsupervised data generation for mathematical problem solving. This can involve conducting ablation studies to isolate the impact of different factors (e.g., prompt design, data quality, fine-tuning strategy) on model performance and providing insights into the current state and future directions of this research area."
