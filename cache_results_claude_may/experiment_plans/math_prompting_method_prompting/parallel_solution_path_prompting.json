        "Problem": "For multistep math problems, large language models often fixate on a single solution path which may turn out to be suboptimal or incorrect. Generating multiple diverse solution paths can potentially improve robustness and accuracy.",
        "Existing Methods": "Multistep math benchmarks like SVAMP and GSM8K are used to test stepwise problem solving capabilities of LLMs. Existing methods generate a single solution path via chain-of-thought prompting or program synthesis.",
        "Motivation": "Many multistep math problems admit multiple valid solution paths. Exploring diverse paths in parallel hedges against getting stuck on suboptimal paths and allows for cross-verification of the final answer. We hypothesize that prompting LLMs to generate multiple diverse solution paths and aggregating the results can boost accuracy and robustness.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Parallel Solution Path Prompting (PSPP) which prompts LLMs to generate multiple solution paths (e.g., 3-5 paths) for a given problem. Diversity among the paths is encouraged via high-level descriptions (e.g., 'let's solve this using a different approach'). The generated paths are executed in parallel to obtain multiple final answers. The most frequent answer is returned, or the paths are aggregated using majority voting or learned weighting schemes.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate PSPP on multistep math benchmarks like SVAMP and GSM8K. Compare with vanilla chain-of-thought prompting in terms of accuracy and robustness. Ablate the number of parallel paths and the path aggregation schemes. Analyze how path diversity correlates with answer correctness."

            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate PSPP on multistep math benchmarks SVAMP and GSM8K. Use answer accuracy as the main metric.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "Baseline prompt is standard chain-of-thought, e.g. 'Q: [problem] A: Let's solve this step-by-step:'. For PSPP, prompt the model to generate multiple paths, e.g. 'Q: [problem] A: Let's solve this in a few different ways:\nPath 1: [generate path 1]\nPath 2: Let's try a different approach. [generate path 2]\nPath 3: Here's another way to think about it. [generate path 3]'.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate on both GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 via the OpenAI API to compare performance.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each test example, use the constructed prompts to generate multiple solution paths (baselines will just generate one path). Execute each path to get the final answers. Aggregate the answers across paths for each example (e.g. take the majority answer).",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Compare the accuracy of PSPP vs the chain-of-thought baseline. Ablate the number of parallel paths (e.g. 1, 3, 5) to see the impact. Try different path aggregation schemes (majority voting, learned weights, etc). Analyze how path diversity correlates with answer correctness."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Input": "Carla has 4 times as many books as Maria. If Carla gives Maria 30 of her books, she will only have 3 times as many as Maria. How many books do Carla and Maria each have?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Q: Carla has 4 times as many books as Maria. If Carla gives Maria 30 of her books, she will only have 3 times as many as Maria. How many books do Carla and Maria each have? A: Let's solve this step-by-step:",
                "Baseline Output": "Let x be the number of books Maria has. Then Carla has 4x books. If Carla gives Maria 30 books, then Carla will have 4x - 30 books and Maria will have x + 30 books. We know that after giving the books, Carla has 3 times as many books as Maria. So 4x - 30 = 3(x + 30). Expanding the right side, we get: 4x - 30 = 3x + 90. Subtracting 3x from both sides: x - 30 = 90. Adding 30 to both sides: x = 120. So Maria has 120 books and Carla has 4 * 120 = 480 books.",
                "PSPP Prompt": "Q: Carla has 4 times as many books as Maria. If Carla gives Maria 30 of her books, she will only have 3 times as many as Maria. How many books do Carla and Maria each have? A: Let's solve this in a few different ways:\nPath 1: [generate path 1]\nPath 2: Let's try a different approach. [generate path 2]\nPath 3: Here's another way to think about it. [generate path 3]",
                "PSPP Output": "Path 1: Let x be Maria's initial number of books. Then Carla has 4x books initially. After giving 30 books, Carla has 4x - 30 books and Maria has x + 30. We know Carla now has 3 times Maria's books. So 4x - 30 = 3(x + 30). Solving this equation: 4x - 30 = 3x + 90, so x = 120. Maria started with 120 books and Carla with 480.\nPath 2: Suppose after the transfer, Maria has y books. Then Carla would have 3y books finally. We also know Carla gave 30 books to Maria. So Carla's initial books must be 3y + 30, and Maria's initial books must be y - 30. Since Carla initially had 4 times Maria's books, we can write: 3y + 30 = 4(y - 30). Solving this, y = 150. So Maria ends up with 150 books, which means she started with 120, and Carla started with 480.\nPath 3: Assume Carla starts with C books and Maria with M books. We know C = 4M initially and C - 30 = 3(M + 30) after the transfer. Substituting the first equation into the second: 4M - 30 = 3M + 90. Solving, we get M = 120 and C = 4 * 120 = 480.",
                "PSPP Aggregated Output": "Maria started with 120 books and Carla started with 480 books.",
                "Explanation": "All three solution paths in the PSPP output arrive at the same correct answer, providing increased confidence. The paths use different variables and equations but are mathematically equivalent. In contrast, the baseline output, while correct, only provides a single solution path, offering no redundancy or cross-verification."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input": "A school has a total of 1260 students. If the number of girls is 120 less than twice the number of boys, how many boys and girls are there in the school?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Q: A school has a total of 1260 students. If the number of girls is 120 less than twice the number of boys, how many boys and girls are there in the school? A: Let's solve this step-by-step:",
                "Baseline Output": "Let x be the number of boys. Then the number of girls is 2x - 120. We know the total number of students is 1260. So x + (2x - 120) = 1260. Simplifying: 3x - 120 = 1260. Adding 120 to both sides: 3x = 1380. Dividing by 3: x = 460. So there are 460 boys. The number of girls is then 2(460) - 120 = 800. Therefore, there are 460 boys and 800 girls in the school.",
                "PSPP Prompt": "Q: A school has a total of 1260 students. If the number of girls is 120 less than twice the number of boys, how many boys and girls are there in the school? A: Let's solve this in a few different ways:\nPath 1: [generate path 1]\nPath 2: Let's try a different approach. [generate path 2]\nPath 3: Here's another way to think about it. [generate path 3]",
                "PSPP Output": "Path 1: Let b be the number of boys and g the number of girls. We know b + g = 1260 and g = 2b - 120. Substituting the second equation into the first: b + (2b - 120) = 1260. Simplifying: 3b - 120 = 1260. Adding 120 to both sides and dividing by 3, we get b = 460. Plugging this back into g = 2b - 120, we find g = 800.\nPath 2: We can set up a system of equations. Let x be the number of boys and y the number of girls. Then x + y = 1260 and y = 2x - 120. Solving this system by substitution or elimination methods, we get x = 460 and y = 800.\nPath 3: The total number of students is 1260. Let's say there are x boys. Then there are 1260 - x girls, which should be equal to 2x - 120 according to the problem. So 1260 - x = 2x - 120. Solving this equation: 1260 = 3x - 120, so 3x = 1380, and x = 460. The number of girls is then 1260 - 460 = 800.",
                "PSPP Aggregated Output": "There are 460 boys and 800 girls in the school.",
                "Explanation": "Again, all three PSPP paths concur on the same correct answer, reinforcing confidence. Path 1 uses direct substitution, Path 2 sets up a system of equations, and Path 3 solves for the number of boys first and then subtracts from the total. The baseline output is also correct but provides only one solution path."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If PSPP does not outperform the baselines, we can: (1) Analyze the generated paths to see if they are truly diverse and correct. Prompts may need to be refined to encourage more diversity and accuracy. (2) Experiment with different path aggregation schemes, such as using confidence scores or learned weights instead of majority voting. (3) Conduct error analysis to understand failure modes - are certain problem types more challenging for PSPP? This could point to issues in prompt design or model capabilities. (4) If paths are diverse but still mostly incorrect, the problem may be too difficult for the current models - we could try alternative methods like retrieval-augmented generation or more advanced program synthesis. The project could then pivot to analyzing the limitations of PSPP and suggesting future directions."
