        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks that require spatial reasoning, such as geometry and graph problems.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches primarily focus on symbolic reasoning and do not explicitly incorporate spatial or embodied representations.",
        "Motivation": "Embodied cognition suggests that human reasoning is grounded in perceptual and motor experiences. By incorporating embodied representations and reasoning into large language models, we aim to improve their performance on mathematical tasks that involve spatial and graphical reasoning.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Embodied Reasoning Prompting (ERP), a novel prompting method that incorporates visual and spatial representations to support mathematical reasoning. The method consists of three main components: 1) Visual Encoding: The model is prompted to generate a visual representation of the problem, such as a diagram or graph, based on the problem description. 2) Embodied Reasoning: The model is guided to reason about the problem using embodied cues, such as imagining manipulating the visual representation, following paths, or transforming shapes. 3) Symbolic Mapping: The model maps the embodied reasoning steps back to symbolic mathematical expressions to generate the final answer. The prompts are designed to encourage the model to seamlessly transition between visual, embodied, and symbolic reasoning.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ERP on mathematical reasoning tasks that involve spatial and graphical reasoning, such as geometry problems, graph theory, and visual puzzle solving. The proposed method will be compared against state-of-the-art baselines, including chain-of-thought prompting and program-aided language models. We will measure performance using accuracy and conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated visual representations and embodied reasoning steps to assess the effectiveness of the embodied reasoning prompts."

        "Title": "Embodied Reasoning Prompting: Incorporating Visual and Spatial Representations for Mathematical Problem Solving",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks that require spatial reasoning, such as geometry and graph problems, despite pre-training on large amounts of text data. This limitation hinders their performance on real-world mathematical problem-solving tasks that involve visual and spatial components.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to mathematical reasoning in large language models primarily focus on symbolic reasoning and do not explicitly incorporate spatial or embodied representations. However, research in embodied cognition suggests that human reasoning is grounded in perceptual and motor experiences. By incorporating embodied representations and reasoning into large language models, we aim to improve their performance on mathematical tasks that involve spatial and graphical reasoning, drawing inspiration from human cognition.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Embodied Reasoning Prompting (ERP), a novel prompting method that incorporates visual and spatial representations to support mathematical reasoning in large language models. The method consists of three main components:\n1. Visual Encoding: The model is prompted to generate a visual representation of the problem, such as a diagram or graph, based on the problem description.\n2. Embodied Reasoning: The model is guided to reason about the problem using embodied cues, such as imagining manipulating the visual representation, following paths, or transforming shapes.\n3.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will evaluate ERP on mathematical reasoning tasks that involve spatial and graphical reasoning, such as geometry problems from the MATH dataset, graph theory problems from the GeoQA dataset, and visual puzzle-solving tasks from the CLEVR-Math dataset. These datasets cover a range of difficulty levels and problem types to assess the generalizability of the proposed method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "We will compare the proposed ERP method against the following state-of-the-art baselines:\n1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting: Prompting the model to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps before producing the final answer.\n2. Program-Aided Language Models (PAL): Augmenting the language model with a symbolic solver to handle mathematical expressions and equations.\n3. Direct Prompting: Directly prompting the model with the problem statement and asking for the answer without any additional guidance.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Engineering": "For each component of the ERP method, we will design a set of prompts to guide the model's reasoning process. The prompts will be crafted based on the problem type and the desired reasoning steps. For example:\n- Visual Encoding Prompt: \"Given the problem description, generate a visual representation (e.g., diagram or graph) that captures the key elements and relationships mentioned in the problem.\"\n- Embodied Reasoning Prompt: \"Imagine manipulating the visual representation to solve the problem. Describe the steps you would take, such as rotating shapes, following paths, or transforming objects.\"\n- Symbolic Mapping Prompt: \"Translate the embodied reasoning steps into mathematical expressions and equations to calculate the final answer.\"",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use the GPT-4 model from OpenAI as the base language model for our experiments. GPT-4 has shown strong performance on a wide range of reasoning tasks and has the capacity to handle complex prompts.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will measure the performance of the proposed ERP method and the baseline methods using the following metrics:\n1. Accuracy: The percentage of problems correctly solved by the model.\n2. Reasoning Quality: A qualitative assessment of the generated reasoning steps, including their coherence, relevance, and logical consistency.\n3. Efficiency: The average number of reasoning steps and the computation time required to solve the problems.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each dataset and problem type, we will prompt the GPT-4 model using the ERP method and the baseline methods. We will generate answers for a representative sample of problems and record the evaluation metrics. The experiments will be conducted using a standardized hardware setup to ensure fair comparisons.",
            "Step 7: Result Analysis": "We will compare the performance of the ERP method against the baselines using the evaluation metrics. We will conduct statistical tests to determine the significance of the observed differences. Additionally, we will perform a qualitative analysis of the generated visual representations and embodied reasoning steps to assess their effectiveness in supporting mathematical problem-solving. We will also examine the types of problems where ERP shows the most significant improvements and identify any limitations or failure cases."

If not, it's impossible to trace all the edges exactly once without lifting the pen.\n3. Since the graph is connected and all vertices have even degrees (2), it is possible to trace all the edges exactly once without lifting the pen.\n4.

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ERP method does not outperform the baseline methods, we can consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the generated visual representations and embodied reasoning steps to identify any limitations or areas for improvement. This analysis can help inform modifications to the prompting strategy or the design of more effective embodied cues.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt variations and phrasings on the model's performance. Experiment with alternative prompts that emphasize different aspects of the problem or provide additional guidance to the model.\n3. Explore the use of other pre-trained language models or architectures that may be better suited for incorporating visual and spatial representations. Consider models that have been specifically trained on mathematical or scientific text, or models that have demonstrated strong performance on visual reasoning tasks.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand the types of problems where the ERP method fails to provide accurate solutions. Identify common patterns or challenges that the model struggles with, and use this information to refine the prompting approach or develop targeted interventions.\n5. If the ERP method does not yield significant improvements, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of current language models in handling spatial and graphical reasoning tasks. Conduct a comprehensive study to identify the key challenges and propose potential directions for future research in this area.\nBy having a fallback plan in place, we can ensure that the project continues to provide valuable insights and contributions, even if the initial hypothesis does not hold."
