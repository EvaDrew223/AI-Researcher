        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to solve mathematical problems that require commonsense knowledge and reasoning, leading to solutions that are mathematically correct but nonsensical in the real world.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for mathematical problem solving with LLMs primarily focus on the mathematical steps and calculations, without considering the commonsense aspects of the problem context.",
        "Motivation": "Incorporating commonsense knowledge and reasoning into the problem-solving process can help LLMs generate more realistic and contextually appropriate solutions. By prompting the model to consider the real-world implications and constraints of the problem, we can guide it towards more sensible and applicable solutions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-step prompting approach that integrates commonsense reasoning into the mathematical problem-solving process. First, the model is prompted to identify and extract relevant commonsense knowledge from the problem statement. Next, it is prompted to reason about the implications and constraints imposed by this commonsense knowledge on the mathematical solution. Finally, the model is prompted to generate a solution that satisfies both the mathematical requirements and the commonsense constraints. Throughout the process, the model is encouraged to provide explanations and justifications for its reasoning steps.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on datasets that require commonsense reasoning for mathematical problem solving, such as the Commonsense Math Problems (CMP) dataset. Compare the performance with baseline methods that do not incorporate commonsense reasoning. Assess the generated solutions for both mathematical correctness and commonsense validity."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed multi-step prompting method does not improve the performance of LLMs in solving mathematical problems with commonsense reasoning, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated outputs to identify the specific challenges or limitations of the model in incorporating commonsense knowledge and reasoning. This analysis can help inform the development of alternative prompting strategies or modifications to the existing approach.\n2. Investigate the impact of using different pre-trained language models or fine-tuning the models on a larger dataset of commonsense mathematical problems. This can help determine if the performance limitations are due to the inherent capabilities of the chosen models or if additional training data can improve their commonsense reasoning abilities.\n3. Explore alternative prompting techniques, such as using a more structured or guided approach to elicit commonsense knowledge and reasoning from the model. For example, providing the model with a set of predefined commonsense constraints or templates to guide its reasoning process.\n4. Consider incorporating external commonsense knowledge bases or ontologies into the prompting process. By explicitly providing relevant commonsense information to the model, it may be able to better integrate this knowledge into its problem-solving approach.\n5. Conduct a more in-depth error analysis to identify the specific types of commonsense reasoning challenges that the model struggles with. This analysis can help prioritize the development of targeted interventions or prompt engineering techniques to address these specific challenges.\nIf the proposed method and the alternative approaches do not yield satisfactory results, the project can be adapted into an analysis paper that provides insights into the current limitations and challenges of using LLMs for commonsense mathematical problem solving. The paper can discuss the observed failure modes, the potential reasons behind these failures, and propose future research directions to address these challenges."
