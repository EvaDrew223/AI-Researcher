                "Problem": "A rectangular field has a length that is 5 meters longer than its width. If the perimeter of the field is 130 meters, what is the area of the field in square meters?",
                "Baseline Prompt (Direct)": "A rectangular field has a length that is 5 meters longer than its width. If the perimeter of the field is 130 meters, what is the area of the field in square meters?",
                "Baseline Output (Direct)": "Let's say the width of the field is x meters. Then the length is x + 5 meters. The perimeter is 130 meters, so: 2(x) + 2(x + 5) = 130. Solving this, we get x = 30. So the width is 30 meters and the length is 35 meters. The area is width * length = 30 * 35 = 1050 square meters.",
                "Baseline Prompt (CoT)": "A rectangular field has a length that is 5 meters longer than its width. If the perimeter of the field is 130 meters, what is the area of the field in square meters? Let's think step by step.",
                "Baseline Output (CoT)": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step: 1) Let's define variables. Let the width be w and the length be l. 2) We know that the length is 5 meters more than the width. So, l = w + 5. 3) We also know that the perimeter is 130 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w). So, 2(l + w) = 130. 4) Substituting l with w + 5, we get: 2((w + 5) + w) = 130 2(2w + 5) = 130 4w + 10 = 130 4w = 120 w = 30 5) So, the width is 30 meters. The length is w + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 meters. 6) The area of a rectangle is length * width. So, the area is 35 * 30 = 1050 square meters. Therefore, the area of the field is 1050 square meters.",

If the perimeter of the field is 130 meters, what is the area of the field in square meters? Given the problem statement, what are the key assumptions we need to make to solve this problem? List them explicitly.",
                "AEP Output (Assumption Elicitation)": "To solve this problem, we need to make the following assumptions: 1) The field is a perfect rectangle. This means all angles are 90 degrees and opposite sides are equal in length. 2) The length and width measurements are in the same unit (meters). 3) The 5 meters added to the length is a constant, not a variable. 4) The perimeter given (130 meters) is accurate and includes all sides of the rectangle. 5) We can use the standard formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle: perimeter = 2(length + width), area = length * width.",
                "AEP Prompt (Solution Generation)": "Using the assumptions you listed, solve the problem step-by-step.",
                "AEP Output (Solution Generation)": "Step 1: Let's define variables. Let the width be w and the length be l. From assumption 3, we know that l = w + 5. Step 2: From assumption 4, we know that the perimeter is 130 meters. Using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle from assumption 5, we can write an equation: 2(l + w) = 130 Step 3: Substitute l with w + 5 based on assumption 3: 2((w + 5) + w) = 130 2(2w + 5) = 130 4w + 10 = 130 4w = 120 w = 30 Step 4: Now we know the width is 30 meters. We can calculate the length using l = w + 5: l = 30 + 5 = 35 meters Step 5: Using the formula for the area of a rectangle from assumption 5: area = length * width = 35 * 30 = 1050 square meters. Therefore, based on the given assumptions, the area of the rectangular field is 1050 square meters.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline methods jump straight into solving the problem without explicitly stating the assumptions. This can lead to errors if the assumptions are not clear or if the problem requires unconventional assumptions. AEP explicitly elicits the assumptions first, making them clear and allowing the model to use them in the solution steps. This leads to a more structured and reliable problem-solving approach."

                "Problem": "A store sells apples for $1 each and bananas for $0.50 each. If a customer buys 10 pieces of fruit and the total cost is $7, how many apples and bananas did the customer buy?",

                "Baseline Output (Direct)": "Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. Let's define variables first. Let a be the number of apples and b be the number of bananas. We know that: a + b = 10 (total pieces of fruit) 1a + 0.5b = 7 (total cost) From the first equation, we can express b in terms of a: b = 10 - a Substituting this into the second equation: 1a + 0.5(10 - a) = 7 1a + 5 - 0.5a = 7 0.5a = 2 a = 4 So the customer bought 4 apples. We can find the number of bananas by substituting a = 4 into the equation b = 10 - a: b = 10 - 4 = 6 Therefore, the customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.",

                "Baseline Output (CoT)": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step: 1) Let's define our variables. Let a be the number of apples and b be the number of bananas. 2) We know the customer bought 10 pieces of fruit in total. So: a + b = 10 3) We also know that apples cost $1 each and bananas cost $0.50 each, and the total cost was $7. So: 1a + 0.5b = 7 4) From equation in step 2, we can express b in terms of a: b = 10 - a 5) Substituting this into the equation from step 3: 1a + 0.5(10 - a) = 7 1a + 5 - 0.5a = 7 0.5a = 2 a = 4 6) So the customer bought 4 apples. We can find the number of bananas by substituting a = 4 into the equation from step 4: b = 10 - 4 = 6 7) Therefore, the customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas. So, the answer is that the customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.",

If a customer buys 10 pieces of fruit and the total cost is $7, how many apples and bananas did the customer buy? Given the problem statement, what are the key assumptions we need to make to solve this problem? List them explicitly.",
                "AEP Output (Assumption Elicitation)": "To solve this problem, we need to make the following assumptions: 1) The customer only bought apples and bananas, no other types of fruit. 2) Each apple costs exactly $1 and each banana costs exactly $0.50. There is no discount for buying in bulk or any other price variations. 3) The total number of fruits bought is exactly 10 pieces, no more and no less. 4) The total cost of $7 is the exact amount paid for the 10 pieces of fruit, without any tax, discount, or other fees. 5) We can use algebraic equations to represent the number of apples and bananas bought, and solve for the unknowns.",

                "AEP Output (Solution Generation)": "Step 1: Based on assumption 5, let's define variables. Let a be the number of apples and b be the number of bananas. Step 2: From assumption 3, we know the total pieces of fruit is 10. So we can write our first equation: a + b = 10 Step 3: From assumptions 2 and 4, we can write our second equation. Each apple costs $1 and each banana costs $0.50, and the total cost is $7, so: 1a + 0.5b = 7 Step 4: From the equation in step 2, we can express b in terms of a: b = 10 - a Step 5: Substitute the expression for b into the equation from step 3: 1a + 0.5(10 - a) = 7 1a + 5 - 0.5a = 7 0.5a = 2 a = 4 Step 6: So the customer bought 4 apples. We can find the number of bananas by substituting a = 4 into the equation from step 4: b = 10 - 4 = 6 Therefore, based on the given assumptions, the customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.",
                "Explanation": "While the baseline methods manage to solve this problem correctly, they do not explicitly state the assumptions they are making. AEP, on the other hand, clearly lists out all the necessary assumptions before starting the solution. This makes the problem-solving process more transparent and allows for easier error checking. If any of the assumptions are violated (e.g., if there was a discount on the fruits), the AEP solution can be easily adjusted, whereas the baseline solutions might need to be completely reworked."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If AEP does not outperform the baselines, we can: 1) Analyze the quality of the elicited assumptions. Are they relevant, sufficient, and correct? If not, we can try to improve the assumption elicitation prompt. 2) Check if the model is properly utilizing the elicited assumptions in the solution steps. If not, we can try to make the solution generation prompt more explicit in referring back to the assumptions. 3) Investigate if there are certain types of problems where AEP is more or less effective. This can lead to insights about when explicit assumption elicitation is necessary or helpful. 4) Consider extending AEP to a multi-turn interaction, where the model can ask clarifying questions about the problem to gather more information before listing assumptions and solving the problem. 5) If AEP still does not show promising results after these modifications, we can pivot to an analysis of why explicit assumption elicitation is challenging for LLMs and what kind of reasoning capabilities would be needed to improve on this task."
