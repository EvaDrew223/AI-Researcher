        "Problem": "Large language models can struggle with mathematical problems that require reasoning about physical systems and embodied concepts, such as spatial relationships, motion, and force interactions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for mathematical problem solving with LLMs primarily operate in an abstract, disembodied space, without considering the physical grounding of the problem.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to reason about mathematical problems in an embodied context, we can help it to better understand and solve problems that involve physical systems. This can be achieved by encouraging the model to simulate or imagine the physical scenario described in the problem, and to reason about the mathematical relationships within this embodied context.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an embodied mathematical reasoning prompting approach. First, the model is prompted to construct a mental simulation or imagined scenario based on the physical details provided in the problem statement. It is encouraged to reason about the spatial relationships, motions, and interactions of the entities involved. Then, the model is prompted to identify the relevant mathematical relationships and constraints within this embodied context. Finally, it is prompted to solve the problem by applying mathematical reasoning within the simulated physical scenario.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on mathematical problem-solving datasets that involve physical systems and embodied reasoning, such as the Physics Questions Dataset (PQD).

This can be achieved by encouraging the model to simulate or imagine the physical scenario described in the problem, and to reason about the mathematical relationships within this embodied context.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an embodied mathematical reasoning prompting approach with three main steps: 1) Prompt the model to construct a mental simulation or imagined scenario based on the physical details provided in the problem statement. Encourage it to reason about the spatial relationships, motions, and interactions of the entities involved. 2) Prompt the model to identify the relevant mathematical relationships and constraints within this embodied context. 3) Prompt the model to solve the problem by applying mathematical reasoning within the simulated physical scenario.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate the proposed method on mathematical problem-solving datasets that involve physical systems and embodied reasoning, such as the Physics Questions Dataset (PQD). This dataset contains physics word problems that require reasoning about physical scenarios.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We will compare three prompting methods: 1) Direct Prompting (Baseline): Directly provide the question to the model and prompt it to answer. 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting (Baseline): Prompt the model to generate a chain of thought before providing the final answer, using the prompt \"Let's solve this step-by-step:\". 3) Embodied Reasoning Prompting (Proposed): Use a three-stage prompting approach. First, prompt the model to imagine the physical scenario using the prompt \"Imagine the physical scenario described in the problem. Describe the spatial relationships, motions, and interactions of the entities involved:\". Then, prompt it to identify relevant mathematical relationships using \"Identify the key mathematical relationships and constraints within this physical scenario:\". Finally, prompt it to solve the problem using \"Now, solve the problem by applying mathematical reasoning within the imagined physical scenario:\".",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the prompting methods using GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 via the OpenAI API.",

            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Compare the accuracy of the embodied reasoning prompting method against the two baseline methods (direct prompting and CoT prompting). Conduct statistical significance tests to determine if the proposed method yields significant improvements. Qualitatively analyze a sample of the generated embodied reasoning traces to gain insights into how the model is simulating and reasoning about the physical scenarios."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Question": "A ball is thrown vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. What is the maximum height reached by the ball? (Assume negligible air resistance and take the acceleration due to gravity as 10 m/s^2)",
                "Direct Prompting Output": "The maximum height reached by the ball is 20 meters.",
                "CoT Prompting Output": "To find the maximum height, we can use the equation: v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad, where v_f is the final velocity (0 m/s at max height), v_i is the initial velocity (20 m/s), a is the acceleration (-10 m/s^2), and d is the displacement (max height). Plugging in the values: 0 = 20^2 + 2(-10)d. Solving for d, we get d = 20 meters. So the maximum height reached is 20 meters.",
                "Embodied Reasoning Prompting Output": "Imagining the scenario: A ball is thrown straight up from the ground with an initial upward velocity of 20 m/s. As it rises, gravity will slow it down at a rate of 10 m/s^2 until it reaches its peak height and then starts falling back down.\n\nKey mathematical relationships: \n- Initial velocity (v_i) = 20 m/s\n- Acceleration due to gravity (a) = -10 m/s^2 (negative because gravity is downward)\n- Final velocity (v_f) = 0 m/s (at maximum height)\n- Displacement (d) = maximum height (unknown)\n- Kinematic equation: v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad\n\nSolving:\nAt the maximum height, the final velocity is 0. So:\n0^2 = 20^2 + 2(-10)d\n0 = 400 - 20d\n20d = 400\nd = 400/20 = 20\n\nTherefore, imagining the ball rising and slowing down due to gravity, the maximum height it reaches is 20 meters.",
                "Explanation": "The direct prompting output is incorrect because it does not provide any reasoning and simply states an incorrect height. The CoT prompting output correctly applies the relevant kinematic equation to solve for the maximum height. The embodied reasoning output first imagines the physical scenario of the ball rising and slowing down due to gravity, then identifies the key mathematical relationships within this context, and finally applies the appropriate equation to solve the problem, providing a more comprehensive and physically grounded solution."

            "Test Case 2": {
                "Question": "A 50 kg crate is being pushed across a horizontal floor by a force of 200 N. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the floor is 0.3, what is the acceleration of the crate? (Take the acceleration due to gravity as 10 m/s^2)",
                "Direct Prompting Output": "The acceleration of the crate is 2 m/s^2.",
                "CoT Prompting Output": "To find the acceleration, we can use Newton's Second Law: F_net = ma. The net force is the applied force minus the friction force. The friction force is given by F_f = \u03bcmg, where \u03bc is the coefficient of friction (0.3), m is the mass (50 kg), and g is the acceleration due to gravity (10 m/s^2). So F_f = 0.3 * 50 * 10 = 150 N. The net force is then 200 N - 150 N = 50 N. Using F_net = ma, we have 50 = 50a. Solving for a, we get a = 1 m/s^2. Therefore, the acceleration of the crate is 1 m/s^2.",
                "Embodied Reasoning Prompting Output": "Imagining the scenario: A 50 kg crate is being pushed horizontally across a floor. The pushing force is 200 N. The floor exerts a frictional force that opposes the motion, with a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.3.\n\nKey mathematical relationships:\n- Mass of the crate (m) = 50 kg\n- Pushing force (F_push) = 200 N\n- Coefficient of kinetic friction (\u03bc) = 0.3\n- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 10 m/s^2\n- Friction force (F_f) = \u03bcmg\n- Net force (F_net) = F_push - F_f\n- Newton's Second Law: F_net = ma\n\nSolving:\nFirst, calculate the friction force:\nF_f = 0.3 * 50 * 10 = 150 N\n\nNext, find the net force:\nF_net = 200 N - 150 N = 50 N\n\nNow, apply Newton's Second Law:\n50 = 50a\na = 50/50 = 1 m/s^2\n\nImagining the crate being pushed and the floor exerting a frictional force, the acceleration of the crate is 1 m/s^2.",
                "Explanation": "The direct prompting output is incorrect and provides no reasoning. The CoT prompting output correctly identifies the relevant forces, applies Newton's Second Law, and solves for the acceleration. The embodied reasoning output imagines the physical scenario of the crate being pushed and the floor exerting a frictional force, identifies the key mathematical relationships, and then applies Newton's Second Law to solve for the acceleration. By grounding the problem in a physical context, the embodied reasoning approach provides a more comprehensive solution."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed embodied reasoning prompting method does not yield significant improvements over the baseline methods, we can conduct additional analyses to understand why. Some potential steps:\n1. Analyze the quality of the generated physical scenarios and mathematical relationships. Are they relevant and accurate? If not, the model may need more guidance or examples of how to construct useful mental simulations.\n2. Examine cases where the model struggles to apply mathematical reasoning within the embodied context. This could indicate limitations in the model's ability to map between physical scenarios and mathematical concepts.\n3. Investigate whether the performance varies across different types of physical systems or mathematical concepts. This could help identify specific areas where embodied reasoning is more or less effective.\n4. Consider alternative prompting strategies or fine-tuning approaches to better guide the model's embodied reasoning process.\nIf the proposed method shows promise but does not consistently outperform baselines, the project could pivot to an analysis of when and why embodied reasoning helps, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of this approach for enhancing mathematical problem-solving in language models."
