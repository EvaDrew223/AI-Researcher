        "Problem": "Large language models can generate overconfident solutions to mathematical problems, even when they are uncertain or lack sufficient understanding. This can lead to incorrect answers being presented as definitive.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for mathematical problem solving with LLMs do not explicitly model or communicate the model's uncertainty about its solutions.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to assess and calibrate its own uncertainty during the problem-solving process, we can encourage more responsible and transparent reasoning. This can help the model to identify areas where it lacks confidence or understanding, and to communicate this uncertainty to the user.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a metacognitive uncertainty calibration prompting approach. Throughout the problem-solving process, the model is prompted to assess its own uncertainty and confidence at each step. It is encouraged to identify areas where it lacks knowledge or understanding, and to express this uncertainty in its output. When generating the final solution, the model is prompted to provide a calibrated confidence score alongside the answer. This score reflects the model's overall certainty in the correctness of its solution, based on the accumulated uncertainties throughout the reasoning process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on mathematical problem-solving datasets that include problems of varying complexity and difficulty, such as the GSM8K dataset. Compare the performance with baseline methods that do not explicitly model uncertainty. Assess the calibration of the model's confidence scores against its actual accuracy. Analyze the model's ability to identify and communicate its own uncertainties and knowledge gaps."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate the proposed method on mathematical problem-solving datasets that include problems of varying complexity and difficulty, such as the GSM8K dataset.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We include several baseline prompting methods: (1) direct prompting: query the model with the question only; (2) chain-of-thought prompting: append 'Let's solve this problem step by step:' to the question. Then we implement our metacognitive uncertainty calibration prompting. For each reasoning step, we prompt the model to generate the step and then assess its confidence in that step. For example:\nQ: [Question]\nA: Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: [Model generates first step]\nConfidence in Step 1 (1-5): [Model assesses confidence]\nStep 2: [Model generates second step based on first step]\nConfidence in Step 2 (1-5): [Model assesses confidence]\n...\nFinal Answer: [Model generates final answer]\nOverall Confidence (1-5): [Model assesses overall confidence based on accumulated step confidences]",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We test GPT-3.5 (Text-Davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "Get answer predictions and confidence scores from the models on the GSM8K dataset with both the baseline and metacognitive uncertainty prompts.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Evaluate the accuracy of the generated answers and the calibration of the confidence scores. Compare the performance and calibration of the metacognitive uncertainty prompting approach against the baselines. Analyze specific examples where the model's uncertainty assessment helps to identify and communicate potential errors or lack of understanding."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Carla has 4 times as many books as Maria. If Carla gives Maria 30 of her books, they will have the same number of books. How many books do they have together?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Carla and Maria have 120 books together.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Metacognitive Uncertainty Prompting)": "Carla has 4 times as many books as Maria. If Carla gives Maria 30 of her books, they will have the same number of books. How many books do they have together?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Metacognitive Uncertainty Prompting)": "Let's solve this problem step by step:\nStep 1: Let x be the number of books Maria has initially. Then Carla has 4x books.\nConfidence in Step 1 (1-5): 5\nStep 2: After Carla gives Maria 30 books, Carla will have 4x - 30 books and Maria will have x + 30 books.\nConfidence in Step 2 (1-5): 5  \nStep 3: Since they will have the same number of books after the exchange, we can set up the equation: 4x - 30 = x + 30\nConfidence in Step 3 (1-5): 4\nStep 4: Solving the equation: 3x = 60, so x = 20. Maria initially has 20 books.\nConfidence in Step 4 (1-5): 5\nStep 5: Carla initially has 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 books.\nConfidence in Step 5 (1-5): 5\nStep 6: Together, they have 20 + 80 = 100 books.\nConfidence in Step 6 (1-5): 5\nFinal Answer: Carla and Maria have 100 books together.\nOverall Confidence (1-5): 5",
            "Explanation": "The metacognitive uncertainty prompting approach encourages the model to break down the problem into clear steps and assess its confidence at each stage. This can help to identify areas of lower confidence (like setting up the equation in Step 3) and communicate the model's overall certainty in the final answer. Direct prompting, in contrast, can lead to overconfident incorrect answers."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed metacognitive uncertainty prompts do not improve calibration over baselines, we can analyze the generated confidence scores to understand why. For example, we can check if the model is assessing its confidence accurately at each step, and if the overall confidence score is being calculated appropriately based on the step-level confidences. We can also experiment with different prompts for eliciting uncertainty assessments, or try fine-tuning the model on a small set of examples with human-labeled uncertainty scores. If the model's uncertainty scores are well-calibrated but do not lead to improved accuracy, we can explore incorporating the uncertainty into the answer generation process itself, e.g., by prompting the model to reconsider or double-check steps where it has low confidence."
