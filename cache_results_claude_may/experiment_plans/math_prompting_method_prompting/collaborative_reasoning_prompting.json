        "Problem": "Large language models often produce inconsistent or incorrect solutions when solving complex mathematical problems that require multiple reasoning steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches, such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency, rely on a single model to generate the entire reasoning process.",
        "Motivation": "Collaborative problem-solving has been shown to be effective in human learning and problem-solving. By leveraging the diverse knowledge and reasoning capabilities of multiple large language models, we aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of mathematical problem-solving.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Collaborative Reasoning Prompting (CRP), a novel prompting method that engages multiple large language models in a collaborative problem-solving process. The method consists of three main stages: 1) Problem Decomposition: The first model is prompted to break down the complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. 2) Parallel Reasoning: Each sub-problem is assigned to a different language model, which generates a solution using its own reasoning process. 3) Solution Integration: The final model is prompted to integrate the sub-problem solutions, resolve any inconsistencies, and generate the final answer. The prompts are designed to encourage the models to communicate their reasoning steps, identify and resolve conflicts, and reach a consensus on the final solution.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CRP on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, such as MATH, GSM8K, and AQuA. The proposed method will be compared against state-of-the-art baselines, including chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency techniques. We will measure performance using accuracy and conduct a qualitative analysis of the collaborative reasoning process to assess the effectiveness of the multi-model approach in improving problem-solving performance."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CRP method does not outperform the baseline methods, we can consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the problem decomposition step to determine if the sub-problems are well-defined and cover all aspects of the original problem. If needed, refine the problem decomposition prompt to encourage more effective sub-problem generation.\n2. Examine the parallel reasoning step to assess the quality of the sub-problem solutions. If the solutions are inconsistent or incorrect, consider using a different set of language models or adjusting the parallel reasoning prompt to encourage more accurate and coherent solutions.\n3. Evaluate the solution integration step to ensure that the sub-problem solutions are effectively combined and any inconsistencies are resolved. If needed, modify the solution integration prompt to promote better integration and conflict resolution.\n4. If the CRP method still does not show significant improvement after these modifications, we can conduct a detailed error analysis to identify common patterns and sources of errors. This analysis can inform the development of alternative prompting strategies or the selection of more suitable language models for the task.\n5. If the CRP method fails to outperform the baselines despite these efforts, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of collaborative problem-solving in language models. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the challenges of multi-model reasoning and guide future research in this area."
