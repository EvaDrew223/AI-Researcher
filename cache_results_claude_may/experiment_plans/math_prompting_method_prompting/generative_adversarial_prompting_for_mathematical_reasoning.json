        "Problem": "Large language models can generate mathematically correct solutions that are not always the most efficient or elegant. They may also struggle to identify and correct errors in their own reasoning process.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for mathematical problem solving with LLMs focus on generating a single solution, without considering alternative approaches or self-correction.",
        "Motivation": "By employing a generative adversarial approach, we can prompt the model to generate multiple competing solutions and then critically evaluate and refine them. This process can lead to more efficient, elegant, and robust solutions, as well as improve the model's ability to detect and correct its own errors.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a generative adversarial prompting approach for mathematical reasoning. First, the model is prompted to generate multiple candidate solutions for a given problem. Then, it is prompted to act as a critic and evaluate each solution based on criteria such as efficiency, elegance, and correctness. The model is encouraged to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential errors in each solution. Finally, the model is prompted to refine and improve the most promising solution(s) based on the critic's feedback. This process can be iterated multiple times to further refine the solution.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on challenging mathematical problem-solving datasets, such as the MATH dataset. Compare the performance with baseline methods that generate a single solution without adversarial refinement. Assess the generated solutions for mathematical correctness, efficiency, and elegance.

        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate mathematically correct solutions that are not always the most efficient or elegant. They may also struggle to identify and correct errors in their own reasoning process.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for mathematical problem solving with LLMs focus on generating a single solution, without considering alternative approaches or self-correction.

This process can lead to more efficient, elegant, and robust solutions, as well as improve the model's ability to detect and correct its own errors. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great success in image generation tasks by training a generator and a discriminator in a competitive setting. We propose to adapt this idea to prompting for mathematical problem solving, where the LLM acts as both the generator and the discriminator.",

We generate three candidate solutions, critique them, and refine the most promising solution. We repeat the critique and refinement steps for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 3) or until the model indicates that no further improvements can be made.",

This process leads to a more efficient and elegant solution, demonstrating the model's ability to identify and correct weaknesses in its own reasoning."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed generative adversarial prompting method does not significantly outperform the baseline methods, we can conduct further analysis to understand the reasons behind the suboptimal performance. Some potential areas to investigate include:\n\n1. Quality of generated solutions: Analyze the diversity and correctness of the solutions generated by the model. If the generated solutions lack variety or contain errors, it may hinder the effectiveness of the critic and refinement steps.\n\n2. Effectiveness of the critic: Evaluate the critic's ability to identify strengths, weaknesses, and errors in the generated solutions. If the critic fails to provide accurate and constructive feedback, it may limit the model's ability to refine the solutions.\n\n3. Refinement process: Examine how well the model incorporates the critic's feedback during the refinement step. If the model struggles to address the identified weaknesses or fails to improve the solution's efficiency and elegance, it may indicate limitations in the refinement process.\n\nBased on the findings from the above analysis, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n\n1. Fine-tuning the prompts: Experiment with different prompts for the generator, critic, and refinement steps to encourage more diverse and high-quality solutions, more accurate and constructive feedback, and more effective incorporation of feedback during refinement.\n\n2. Adjusting the number of iterations: Increase or decrease the number of critique and refinement iterations to find the optimal balance between solution quality and computational efficiency.\n\n3. Exploring alternative architectures: Consider modifications to the generative adversarial prompting architecture, such as introducing a separate model for the critic or incorporating reinforcement learning techniques to guide the refinement process.\n\nIf the proposed method and its variations still do not yield satisfactory results, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of generative adversarial prompting for mathematical problem solving. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the challenges of applying adversarial techniques to prompting and guide future research in this area."
