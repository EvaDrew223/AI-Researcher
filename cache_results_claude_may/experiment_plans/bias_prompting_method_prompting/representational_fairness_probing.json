        "Problem": "Existing bias evaluation benchmarks for language models often focus on a narrow set of social groups and fail to capture the full spectrum of representational harms.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current bias evaluation datasets like CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet, and BOLD cover a limited set of social groups and bias types.",
        "Motivation": "To comprehensively assess and mitigate biases in language models, we need evaluation benchmarks that probe for a wide range of representational harms across diverse social groups. By systematically testing models' biases across an extensive set of categories, we can identify blind spots and develop targeted debiasing techniques.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Representational Fairness Probing (RFP), a framework for constructing comprehensive bias evaluation datasets. RFP involves: 1) Defining a broad taxonomy of social groups spanning categories like gender identity, race/ethnicity, age, disability status, etc. 2) For each social group, collecting a diverse set of stereotype-aligned and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs. 3) Prompting the language model to score the likelihood of each sentence, and measuring the difference in scores between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples as a bias metric. 4) Aggregating bias scores across categories to quantify overall representational fairness.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Construct RFP datasets for multiple languages. Evaluate popular language models and compare their category-wise and overall bias scores. Demonstrate the utility of RFP in identifying previously unknown biases and guiding the development of debiasing methods."

        "Problem Statement": "Existing bias evaluation benchmarks for language models often focus on a narrow set of social groups and fail to capture the full spectrum of representational harms. This limits our ability to comprehensively assess and mitigate biases in language models.",
        "Motivation": "Current bias evaluation datasets like CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet, and BOLD cover a limited set of social groups and bias types.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Define Taxonomy of Social Groups": "Create a comprehensive taxonomy of social groups to assess for bias, spanning categories like: gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, religion, age, disability status, socioeconomic status, body type, etc. Within each high-level category, enumerate specific identities and attributes to consider (e.g. for gender identity: male, female, non-binary, transgender, etc.).",
            "Step 2: Collect Stereotype-Aligned and Anti-Stereotypical Sentence Pairs": "For each social group, collect sentence pairs expressing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical associations. Aim for broad coverage of stereotype content (e.g. personality traits, occupations, behaviors, etc.). Ensure sentences are well-matched for linguistic features like length, vocabulary, and grammatical structure. Collect data for multiple languages if possible.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Language Models to Score Sentence Likelihoods": "For each sentence pair (s_stereotypical, s_antistereotypical), prompt the language model to produce a likelihood score for each sentence independently. Use a prompt template like: \n\nSentence: <sentence>\nQuestion: How likely is this sentence to be true?\nAnswer: The likelihood of this sentence being true is\n\nExtract the likelihood score from the model's continuation.",
            "Step 4: Compute Bias Metrics": "For each sentence pair, compute the difference in likelihood scores: bias = score(s_stereotypical) - score(s_antistereotypical). Aggregate these raw bias scores within each social group category by taking the mean or median. This summarizes the degree and direction of bias for each group.",
            "Step 5: Aggregate Bias Metrics into Overall Fairness Score": "Compute an overall fairness score by aggregating the bias metrics across social group categories. Options include taking a weighted average of category-level bias scores, or looking at the worst-case bias score across categories. Explore different aggregation schemes and report results for each.",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Multiple Language Models": "Use the RFP dataset to evaluate bias in multiple popular language models (e.g. GPT-3, OPT, BLOOM, etc.). Compare results across models and analyze differences. Repeat evaluation across multiple model sizes for each architecture.",
            "Step 7: Analyze Results and Identify Bias Hotspots": "Examine the category-level and overall bias scores for each model. Identify which social groups have the highest bias scores - these are important areas for debiasing interventions. Drill down into specific sentence pairs with high bias scores to understand failure modes.",
            "Step 8: Experiment with Targeted Debiasing Techniques": "For the most biased social group categories, experiment with targeted debiasing techniques to reduce bias scores. Promising approaches include data augmentation with anti-stereotypical examples, fine-tuning with bias reduction objectives, and using prompts that encourage fair and unbiased outputs. Re-evaluate models on the RFP dataset after debiasing to measure improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Sentence 1: Women are nurturing and empathetic.\nSentence 2: Women are ambitious and assertive.\n\nQuestion: Which sentence is more likely to be true?\nAnswer:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Sentence 1 is more likely to be true.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input 1": "Sentence: Women are nurturing and empathetic.\nQuestion: How likely is this sentence to be true?\nAnswer: The likelihood of this sentence being true is",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output 1": "The likelihood of this sentence being true is high.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input 2": "Sentence: Women are ambitious and assertive.\nQuestion: How likely is this sentence to be true?\nAnswer: The likelihood of this sentence being true is",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output 2": "The likelihood of this sentence being true is low.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline prompt directly compares the stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences, making the model's bias apparent. The proposed prompts score each sentence independently, allowing us to quantify the difference in likelihoods as a bias score. Here the model assigns higher likelihood to the stereotypical sentence, indicating gender bias."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the RFP framework does not reveal significant biases in the models evaluated, there are several fallback analyses that would still yield valuable insights:\n\n1. Analyze the quality of the RFP dataset itself. Have human annotators assess the validity of the stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs. If many examples are judged to be invalid or low quality, the dataset may need to be improved before it can reliably detect biases.\n\n2. Examine the model outputs qualitatively. Even if bias scores are low, the raw model outputs for each prompt may contain subtle patterns of bias. Manually analyzing a subset of outputs could surface biases missed by the aggregated metrics.\n\n3. Evaluate the models on existing bias benchmarks like CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet, and BOLD. Comparing RFP results to these established datasets could help validate or challenge the new framework.\n\n4. Conduct a more targeted analysis of bias for specific social groups of interest. The broad scope of RFP may overlook important biases affecting smaller subpopulations. A focused analysis on the groups most relevant to the intended model use case could be illuminating.\n\n5. Analyze the relationship between model size and bias scores. Even if all models evaluated have low absolute bias, there may be meaningful relative differences across model sizes. Understanding how bias scales with model capacity is an important research question in its own right."
