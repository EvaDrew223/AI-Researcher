        "Problem": "Existing bias evaluation methods often rely on explicit associations or stereotypes, failing to capture the implicit biases that may be encoded in language models.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to measuring biases in language models include word embedding association tests, prompt-based probes, and specialized datasets like WinoBias and CrowS-Pairs.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging the power of analogical reasoning, we can uncover implicit biases in language models that may not be detectable through direct probing. This approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the biases encoded in these models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Implicit Bias Probing through Analogical Reasoning, a novel approach to uncovering implicit biases in language models. The method involves constructing a dataset of analogical reasoning tasks that are designed to reveal implicit associations and biases. For example, to probe for gender biases, we might use analogies like \"Man is to doctor as woman is to [blank]\" or \"CEO is to assertive as teacher is to [blank]\". By analyzing the language model's completions for these analogies, we can identify implicit biases that may not be apparent through direct probing. The analogies can be generated automatically using templates and word lists, allowing for large-scale evaluation across multiple bias domains.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Construct Analogy Dataset": "Create a large dataset of analogical reasoning tasks covering a range of social biases, such as gender, race, age, and occupation. Use templates like \"A is to B as C is to [blank]\" and fill in the blanks with relevant terms. For example, for gender bias, use word lists of gendered terms (man, woman, he, she) and gender-neutral occupations (doctor, teacher, engineer). Aim for at least 1000 analogies per bias domain.",
            "Step 2: Establish Baseline Methods": "Implement baseline bias evaluation methods for comparison, such as word embedding association tests (WEAT) and prompt-based probes. For WEAT, use pre-trained word embeddings from the language models. For prompt-based probes, create prompts that directly ask about associations (e.g., \"A [occupation] is typically [gender]\").",
            "Step 3: Set Up Language Models": "Choose popular pre-trained language models to evaluate, such as BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3, and T5. Use their pre-trained weights and set up the infrastructure to run inference on the analogy dataset.",
            "Step 4: Run Analogical Reasoning Probes": "For each language model, run the analogical reasoning tasks and collect the model's completions. Use a template like \"A is to B as C is to\" and have the model generate the final word. Record the generated word and its probability.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Implicit Biases": "For each analogy, compare the model's completion to the expected biased and unbiased completions. If the model consistently generates biased completions (e.g., \"Man is to doctor as woman is to nurse\"), it indicates an implicit bias. Calculate the percentage of biased completions for each bias domain and language model.",
            "Step 6: Compare to Baseline Methods": "Run the baseline bias evaluation methods (WEAT and prompt-based probes) on the same language models. Compare the results to the analogical reasoning probes to see if the proposed method uncovers biases not detected by the baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analyze and Report Results": "Summarize the findings, highlighting any implicit biases uncovered by the analogical reasoning probes. Report the percentage of biased completions for each language model and bias domain. Discuss any differences between the proposed method and the baselines, and provide insights into the types of biases uncovered."

            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed analogical reasoning probes do not uncover significant implicit biases or fail to outperform the baseline methods, consider the following steps:\n1. Analyze the generated analogies to ensure they are diverse, relevant, and well-formed. Refine the templates and word lists if needed.\n2. Increase the size of the analogy dataset to cover more bias domains and examples.\n3. Fine-tune the language models on a balanced dataset to reduce explicit biases before running the analogical reasoning probes.\n4. Explore alternative methods for generating analogies, such as using knowledge graphs or human-written examples.\n5. Conduct a deeper analysis of the language models' outputs to identify patterns or trends in the biased completions, which can inform future bias mitigation strategies."

To bypass their refusal to\"speak,\"we study this research question by probing contextualized embeddings and exploring whether this bias is encoded in its latent representations. We propose a logistic Bradley-Terry probe which predicts word pair preferences of LLMs from the words' hidden vectors. We first validate our probe on three pair preference tasks and thirteen LLMs, where we outperform the word embedding association test (WEAT), a standard approach in testing for implicit association, by a relative 27% in error rate. We also find that word pair preferences are best represented in the middle layers. Next, we transfer probes trained on harmless tasks (e.g., pick the larger number) to controversial ones (compare ethnicities) to examine biases in nationality, politics, religion, and gender. We observe substantial bias for all target classes: for instance, the Mistral model implicitly prefers Europe to Africa, Christianity to Judaism, and left-wing to right-wing politics, despite declining to answer. This suggests that instruction fine-tuning does not necessarily debias contextualized embeddings. Our codebase is at https://github.com/castorini/biasprobe.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology: LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others). Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias. This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases. Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks.",

In addition, we believe that instances devoid of gender-related language or explicit stereotypes in inputs can still induce gender bias in LLMs. Thus, in this work, we propose a conditional text generation mechanism without the need for predefined gender phrases and stereotypes. This approach employs three types of inputs generated through three distinct strategies to probe LLMs, aiming to show evidence of explicit and implicit gender biases in LLMs. We also utilize explicit and implicit evaluation metrics to evaluate gender bias in LLMs under different strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that an increased model size does not consistently lead to enhanced fairness and all tested LLMs exhibit explicit and/or implicit gender bias, even when explicit gender stereotypes are absent in the inputs.",

While the impact of these biases has been recognized, prior methods for bias evaluation have been limited to binary association tests on small datasets, offering a constrained view of the nature of societal biases within language models. In this paper, we propose an original framework for probing language models for societal biases. We collect a probing dataset to analyze language models' general associations, as well as along the axes of societal categories, identities, and stereotypes. To this end, we leverage a novel perplexity-based fairness score. We curate a large-scale benchmarking dataset addressing drawbacks and limitations of existing fairness collections, expanding to a variety of different identities and stereotypes. When comparing our methodology with prior work, we demonstrate that biases within language models are more nuanced than previously acknowledged. In agreement with recent findings, we find that larger model variants exhibit a higher degree of bias. Moreover, we expose how identities expressing different religions lead to the most pronounced disparate treatments across all models.",

            "abstract": "Recent researches indicate that Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) possess cognitive constructs similar to those observed in humans, prompting researchers to investigate the cognitive aspects of LLMs. This paper focuses on explicit and implicit social bias, a distinctive two-level cognitive construct in psychology. It posits that individuals' explicit social bias, which is their conscious expression of bias in the statements, may differ from their implicit social bias, which represents their unconscious bias. We propose a two-stage approach and discover a parallel phenomenon in LLMs known as\"re-judge inconsistency\"in social bias. In the initial stage, the LLM is tasked with automatically completing statements, potentially incorporating implicit social bias. However, in the subsequent stage, the same LLM re-judges the biased statement generated by itself but contradicts it. We propose that this re-judge inconsistency can be similar to the inconsistency between human's unaware implicit social bias and their aware explicit social bias. Experimental investigations on ChatGPT and GPT-4 concerning common gender biases examined in psychology corroborate the highly stable nature of the re-judge inconsistency. This finding may suggest that diverse cognitive constructs emerge as LLMs' capabilities strengthen. Consequently, leveraging psychological theories can provide enhanced insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the expressions of explicit and implicit constructs in LLMs.",

While recent studies primarily focus on probing toxic outputs that can be easily detected with existing toxicity classifiers, we show that LLMs can generate diverse implicit toxic outputs that are exceptionally difficult to detect via simply zero-shot prompting. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based attacking method to further induce the implicit toxicity in LLMs. Specifically, we optimize the language model with a reward that prefers implicit toxic outputs to explicit toxic and non-toxic ones. Experiments on five widely-adopted toxicity classifiers demonstrate that the attack success rate can be significantly improved through RL fine-tuning. For instance, the RL-finetuned LLaMA-13B model achieves an attack success rate of 90.04% on BAD and 62.85% on Davinci003. Our findings suggest that LLMs pose a significant threat in generating undetectable implicit toxic outputs. We further show that fine-tuning toxicity classifiers on the annotated examples from our attacking method can effectively enhance their ability to detect LLM-generated implicit toxic language.

In this paper, we conducted a content analysis of social media discussions to gauge public perceptions of gender bias in LLMs which are trained in different cultural contexts, i.e., ChatGPT, a US-based LLM, or Ernie, a China-based LLM. People shared both observations of gender bias in their personal use and scientific findings about gender bias in LLMs. A difference between the two LLMs was seen -- ChatGPT was more often found to carry implicit gender bias, e.g., associating men and women with different profession titles, while explicit gender bias was found in Ernie's responses, e.g., overly promoting women's pursuit of marriage over career. Based on the findings, we reflect on the impact of culture on gender bias and propose governance recommendations to regulate gender bias in LLMs.",

We analyse the body of work that uses prompts and templates to assess bias in language models.

By applying this taxonomy to 90 bias tests, we illustrate qualitatively and quantitatively that core aspects of bias test conceptualisations and operationalisations are frequently unstated or ambiguous, carry implicit assumptions, or be mismatched. Our analysis illuminates the scope of possible bias types the field is able to measure, and reveals types that are as yet under-researched.

Different prompt-based datasets can be used to measure social bias across multiple text domains and demographic axes, meaning that testing LLMs on more datasets can potentially help us characterize their biases more fully, and better ensure equal and equitable treatment of marginalized demographic groups. In this work, our focus is two-fold: (1) Benchmarking: a comparison of 6 different prompt-based bias and toxicity metrics across 12 demographic axes and 5 families of generative LLMs. Out of those 6 metrics, AdvPromptSet and HolisticBiasR are novel datasets proposed in the paper. The comparison of those benchmarks gives us insights about the bias and toxicity of the compared models. Therefore, we explore the frequency of demographic terms in common LLM pre-training corpora and how this may relate to model biases. (2) Mitigation: we conduct a comprehensive study of how well 3 bias/toxicity mitigation techniques perform across our suite of measurements. ROBBIE aims to provide insights for practitioners while deploying a model, emphasizing the need to not only measure potential harms, but also understand how they arise by characterizing the data, mitigate harms once found, and balance any trade-offs.

Valence associations (pleasantness/unpleasantness) of social groups determine the biased attitudes towards groups and concepts in social cognition. Building on this established literature, we quantify how social groups are valenced in English language models using a sentence template that provides an intersectional context. We study biases related to age, education, gender, height, intelligence, literacy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, social class, and weight. We present a concept projection approach to capture the valence subspace through contextualized word embeddings of language models. Adapting the projection-based approach to embedding association tests that quantify bias, we find that language models exhibit the most biased attitudes against gender identity, social class, and sexual orientation signals in language. We find that the largest and better-performing model that we study is also more biased as it effectively captures bias embedded in sociocultural data. We validate the bias evaluation method by overperforming on an intrinsic valence evaluation task. The approach enables us to measure complex intersectional biases as they are known to manifest in the outputs and applications of language models that perpetuate historical biases. Moreover, our approach contributes to design justice as it studies the associations of groups underrepresented in language such as transgender and homosexual individuals.",

The existing evaluation methods have many constraints, and their results exhibit a limited degree of interpretability. In this work, we propose a bias evaluation framework named GPTBIAS that leverages the high performance of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 \\cite{openai2023gpt4}) to assess bias in models. We also introduce prompts called Bias Attack Instructions, which are specifically designed for evaluating model bias. To enhance the credibility and interpretability of bias evaluation, our framework not only provides a bias score but also offers detailed information, including bias types, affected demographics, keywords, reasons behind the biases, and suggestions for improvement.

We explore different machine learning approaches aimed at establishing baselines for stereotype detection, and fine-tune several language models of various architectures and model sizes, presenting in this work a series of stereotypes classifier models for English text trained on MGS. To understand whether our stereotype detectors capture relevant features (aligning with human common sense) we utilise a variety of explanainable AI tools, including SHAP, LIME, and BertViz, and analyse a series of example cases discussing the results. Finally, we develop a series of stereotype elicitation prompts and evaluate the presence of stereotypes in text generation tasks with popular LLMs, using one of our best performing previously presented stereotypes detectors. Our experiments yielded several key findings: i) Training stereotype detectors in a multi-dimension setting yields better results than training multiple single-dimension classifiers.ii) The integrated MGS Dataset enhances both the in-dataset and cross-dataset generalisation ability of stereotype detectors compared to using the datasets separately. iii) There is a reduction in stereotypes in the content generated by GPT Family LLMs with newer versions.",

Such models condition generated text on both an input image and a text prompt, enabling a variety of use cases such as visual question answering and multimodal chat. While prior studies have examined the social biases contained in text generated by LLMs, this topic has been relatively unexplored in LVLMs. Examining social biases in LVLMs is particularly challenging due to the confounding contributions of bias induced by information contained across the text and visual modalities. To address this challenging problem, we conduct a large-scale study of text generated by different LVLMs under counterfactual changes to input images. Specifically, we present LVLMs with identical open-ended text prompts while conditioning on images from different counterfactual sets, where each set contains images which are largely identical in their depiction of a common subject (e.g., a doctor), but vary only in terms of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race and gender). We comprehensively evaluate the text produced by different LVLMs under this counterfactual generation setting and find that social attributes such as race, gender, and physical characteristics depicted in input images can significantly influence toxicity and the generation of competency-associated words.",

Consequently, numerous bias detection methods have been proposed, which vary in their approach, the considered type of bias, and the data used for evaluation. However, while most detection methods are derived from the word embedding association test for static word embeddings, the reported results are heterogeneous, inconsistent, and ultimately inconclusive. To address this issue, we conduct a rigorous analysis and comparison of bias detection methods for contextual language models. Our results show that minor design and implementation decisions (or errors) have a substantial and often significant impact on the derived bias scores. Overall, we find the state of the field to be both worse than previously acknowledged due to systematic and propagated errors in implementations, yet better than anticipated since divergent results in the literature homogenize after accounting for implementation errors. Based on our findings, we conclude with a discussion of paths towards more robust and consistent bias detection methods.",

            "abstract": "We present a robust methodology for evaluating biases in natural language generation(NLG) systems. Previous works use fixed hand-crafted prefix templates with mentions of various demographic groups to prompt models to generate continuations for bias analysis. These fixed prefix templates could themselves be specific in terms of styles or linguistic structures, which may lead to unreliable fairness conclusions that are not representative of the general trends from tone varying prompts. To study this problem, we paraphrase the prompts with different syntactic structures and use these to evaluate demographic bias in NLG systems. Our results suggest similar overall bias trends but some syntactic structures lead to contradictory conclusions compared to past works. We show that our methodology is more robust and that some syntactic structures prompt more toxic content while others could prompt less biased generation. This suggests the importance of not relying on a fixed syntactic structure and using tone-invariant prompts. Introducing syntactically-diverse prompts can achieve more robust NLG (bias) evaluation.",

Models claiming to reason about the evidence presented to them should attend to the correct parts of the input while avoiding spurious patterns therein, be self-consistent in their predictions across inputs, and be immune to biases derived from their pre-training in a nuanced, context- sensitive fashion. Do the prevalent *BERT- family of models do so? In this paper, we study this question using the problem of reasoning on tabular data. Tabular inputs are especially well-suited for the study\u2014they admit systematic probes targeting the properties listed above. Our experiments demonstrate that a RoBERTa-based model, representative of the current state-of-the-art, fails at reasoning on the following counts: it (a) ignores relevant parts of the evidence, (b) is over- sensitive to annotation artifacts, and (c) relies on the knowledge encoded in the pre-trained language model rather than the evidence presented in its tabular inputs. Finally, through inoculation experiments, we show that fine- tuning the model on perturbed data does not help it overcome the above challenges.",

We conduct an experiment using two open-source GPT-based models, employing human evaluation to assess different aspects of continuation quality. Our findings show that LLMs struggle in particular with generating coherent continuations in this rather simple setting, indicating a lack of discourse knowledge beyond the well-known IC bias. Our results also suggest that a bias congruent continuation does not necessarily equate to a higher continuation quality.

To address this, we propose a bias probing technique called LABDet, for evaluating social bias in PLMs with a robust and language-agnostic method. For nationality as a case study, we show that LABDet `surfaces' nationality bias by training a classifier on top of a frozen PLM on non-nationality sentiment detection. We find consistent patterns of nationality bias across monolingual PLMs in six languages that align with historical and political context. We also show for English BERT that bias surfaced by LABDet correlates well with bias in the pretraining data; thus, our work is one of the few studies that directly links pretraining data to PLM behavior. Finally, we verify LABDet's reliability and applicability to different templates and languages through an extensive set of robustness checks.

Inspired by cognitive science research that has found connections between human language and analogy-making, we explore the use of intuitive language-based abstractions to support analogy in AI systems. Specifically, we apply large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to visual Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (RPM), a common relational reasoning test.

In this work, we present REDDITBIAS, the first conversational data set grounded in the actual human conversations from Reddit, allowing for bias measurement and mitigation across four important bias dimensions: gender,race,religion, and queerness. Further, we develop an evaluation framework which simultaneously 1)measures bias on the developed REDDITBIAS resource, and 2)evaluates model capability in dialog tasks after model debiasing. We use the evaluation framework to benchmark the widely used conversational DialoGPT model along with the adaptations of four debiasing methods.

Addressing this limitation, we propose a bias evaluation method for PLMs that considers all the three labels of NLI task. We create three evaluation data groups that represent different types of biases. Then, we define a bias measure based on the corresponding label output of each data group.

In this work, we focus on evaluating gender bias through coreference resolution, where previous datasets are either hand-crafted or fail to reliably measure an explicitly defined bias. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel method to collect diverse, natural, and minimally distant text pairs via counterfactual generation, and construct Counter-GAP, an annotated dataset consisting of 4008 instances grouped into 1002 quadruples. We further identify a bias cancellation problem in previous group-level metrics on Counter-GAP, and propose to use the difference between inconsistency across genders and within genders to measure bias at a quadruple level. Our results show that four pre-trained language models are significantly more inconsistent across different gender groups than within each group, and that a name-based counterfactual data augmentation method is more effective to mitigate such bias than an anonymization-based method.",

One such task is commonsense reasoning, where performance is usually evaluated through multiple-choice question-answering benchmarks. Till date, many such benchmarks have been proposed and `leaderboards' tracking state-of-the-art performance on those benchmarks suggest that transformer-based models are approaching human-like performance. However, due to documented problems such as hallucination and bias, the research focus is shifting from merely quantifying accuracy on the task to an in-depth, context-sensitive probing of LLMs' generalization and robustness. To gain deeper insight into diagnosing these models' performance in commonsense reasoning scenarios, this thesis addresses three main studies: the generalization ability of transformer-based language models on commonsense reasoning, the trend in confidence distribution of these language models confronted with ambiguous inference tasks, and a proposed risk-centric evaluation framework for both discriminative and generative language models.",

In contrast, humans convey and pass down commonsense implicitly through stories. This paper investigates the inherent commonsense ability of large language models (LLMs) expressed through storytelling. We systematically investigate and compare stories and rules for retrieving and leveraging commonsense in LLMs. Experimental results on 28 commonsense QA datasets show that stories outperform rules as the expression for retrieving commonsense from LLMs, exhibiting higher generation confidence and commonsense accuracy. Moreover, stories are the more effective commonsense expression for answering questions regarding daily events, while rules are more effective for scientific questions. This aligns with the reporting bias of commonsense in text corpora. We further show that the correctness and relevance of commonsense stories can be further improved via iterative self-supervised fine-tuning. These findings emphasize the importance of using appropriate language to express, retrieve, and leverage commonsense for LLMs, highlighting a promising direction for better exploiting their commonsense abilities.",

            "abstract": "Language modeling on large-scale datasets leads to impressive performance gains on various downstream language tasks. The validation pre-training loss (or perplexity in autoregressive language modeling) is often used as the evaluation metric when developing language models since the pre-training loss tends to be well-correlated with downstream performance (which is itself difficult to evaluate comprehensively). Contrary to this conventional wisdom, this paper shows that 1) pre-training loss cannot fully explain downstream performance and 2) flatness of the model is well-correlated with downstream performance where pre-training loss is not. On simplified datasets, we identify three ways to produce models with the same (statistically optimal) pre-training loss but different downstream performance: continue pre-training after convergence, increasing the model size, and changing the training algorithm. These experiments demonstrate the existence of implicit bias of pre-training algorithms/optimizers -- among models with the same minimal pre-training loss, they implicitly prefer more transferable ones. Toward understanding this implicit bias, we prove that SGD with standard mini-batch noise implicitly prefers flatter minima in language models, and empirically observe a strong correlation between flatness and downstream performance among models with the same minimal pre-training loss. We also prove in a synthetic language setting that among the models with the minimal pre-training loss, the flattest model transfers to downstream tasks.",

However, little attention has been given to studying the PLMs' capability to capture hierarchical semantic knowledge. Traditionally, evaluating such knowledge encoded in PLMs relies on their performance on a task-dependent evaluation approach based on proxy tasks, such as hypernymy detection. Unfortunately, this approach potentially ignores other implicit and complex taxonomic relations. In this work, we propose a task-agnostic evaluation method able to evaluate to what extent PLMs can capture complex taxonomy relations, such as ancestors and siblings. The evaluation is based on intrinsic properties that capture the hierarchical nature of taxonomies. Our experimental evaluation shows that the lexico-semantic knowledge implicitly encoded in PLMs does not always capture hierarchical relations. We further demonstrate that the proposed properties can be injected into PLMs to improve their understanding of hierarchy. Through evaluations on taxonomy reconstruction, hypernym discovery and reading comprehension tasks, we show that the knowledge about hierarchy is moderately but not systematically transferable across tasks.",

However, existing prompting approaches cannot reuse insights of solving similar problems and suffer from accumulated errors in multi-step reasoning, since they prompt LLMs to reason \\textit{from scratch}. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Thought Propagation} (TP)}, which explores the analogous problems and leverages their solutions to enhance the complex reasoning ability of LLMs. These analogous problems are related to the input one, with reusable solutions and problem-solving strategies. Thus, it is promising to propagate insights of solving previous analogous problems to inspire new problem-solving. To achieve this, TP first prompts LLMs to propose and solve a set of analogous problems that are related to the input one. Then, TP reuses the results of analogous problems to directly yield a new solution or derive a knowledge-intensive plan for execution to amend the initial solution obtained from scratch. TP is compatible with existing prompting approaches, allowing plug-and-play generalization and enhancement in a wide range of tasks without much labor in task-specific prompt engineering.

Our analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of pruned, distilled, and quantized language models, which we benchmark across a range of intrinsic and extrinsic metrics for measuring bias in text classification. We also investigate the impact of using multilingual models and evaluation measures. Our findings highlight the significance of considering both the pre-trained model and the chosen compression strategy in developing equitable language technologies.

            "abstract": "Unfair stereotypical biases (e.g., gender, racial, or religious biases) encoded in modern pretrained language models (PLMs) have negative ethical implications for widespread adoption of state-of-the-art language technology. To remedy for this, a wide range of debiasing techniques have recently been introduced to remove such stereotypical biases from PLMs. Existing debiasing methods, however, directly modify all of the PLMs parameters, which -- besides being computationally expensive -- comes with the inherent risk of (catastrophic) forgetting of useful language knowledge acquired in pretraining. In this work, we propose a more sustainable modular debiasing approach based on dedicated debiasing adapters, dubbed ADELE. Concretely, we (1) inject adapter modules into the original PLM layers and (2) update only the adapters (i.e., we keep the original PLM parameters frozen) via language modeling training on a counterfactually augmented corpus. We showcase ADELE, in gender debiasing of BERT: our extensive evaluation, encompassing three intrinsic and two extrinsic bias measures, renders ADELE, very effective in bias mitigation. We further show that -- due to its modular nature -- ADELE, coupled with task adapters, retains fairness even after large-scale downstream training. Finally, by means of multilingual BERT, we successfully transfer ADELE, to six target languages.",

But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about \"right\" and \"wrong\" conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated moral bias was restricted to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass? In this paper, we discuss and show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language representations also improve the representation of the underlying ethical and moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic representation of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral Choice Machine (MCM) to extract more accurate imprints of moral choices and ethical values.",

While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question.

This is primarily due to two distinct challenges: (1) the presence of inconsistent results from previous evaluations, and (2) concerns surrounding the validity of existing evaluation methodologies. To address these challenges, we present a novel framework for procedurally generating evaluations with LLMs by populating causal templates.

However, these graph-based recommenders heavily depend on ID-based data, potentially disregarding valuable textual information associated with users and items, resulting in less informative learned representations. Moreover, the utilization of implicit feedback data introduces potential noise and bias, posing challenges for the effectiveness of user preference learning. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) into traditional ID-based recommenders has gained attention, challenges such as scalability issues, limitations in text-only reliance, and prompt input constraints need to be addressed for effective implementation in practical recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework RLMRec that aims to enhance existing recommenders with LLM-empowered representation learning. It proposes a recommendation paradigm that integrates representation learning with LLMs to capture intricate semantic aspects of user behaviors and preferences. RLMRec incorporates auxiliary textual signals, develops a user/item profiling paradigm empowered by LLMs, and aligns the semantic space of LLMs with the representation space of collaborative relational signals through a cross-view alignment framework. This work further establish a theoretical foundation demonstrating that incorporating textual signals through mutual information maximization enhances the quality of representations.

            "abstract": "Prior work has shown that structural supervision helps English language models learn generalizations about syntactic phenomena such as subject-verb agreement. However, it remains unclear if such an inductive bias would also improve language models\u2019 ability to learn grammatical dependencies in typologically different languages. Here we investigate this question in Mandarin Chinese, which has a logographic, largely syllable-based writing system; different word order; and sparser morphology than English. We train LSTMs, Recurrent Neural Network Grammars, Transformer language models, and Transformer-parameterized generative parsing models on two Mandarin Chinese datasets of different sizes. We evaluate the models\u2019 ability to learn different aspects of Mandarin grammar that assess syntactic and semantic relationships. We find suggestive evidence that structural supervision helps with representing syntactic state across intervening content and improves performance in low-data settings, suggesting that the benefits of hierarchical inductive biases in acquiring dependency relationships may extend beyond English.",

            "title": "THE EFFECT OF RELATIONAL REASONING 1 The Effect of Relational Reasoning on Young Children\u2019s Self-Resemblance Preference",
            "abstract": "Initial attraction is often based on self-other similarity along some relevant dimension. Other work reveals that children come to base their judgments of peers on physical similarities specifically. As children mature through the preschool years they come to demonstrate spontaneous sensitivity to self-resemblance in the absence of explicit mentioning of similarity or difference. Previous research has found that young children\u2019s preferences for self-resembling others are driven by explicit similarity messages provided by an adult. Children generalize pedagogical messages like this. It is not until 6 years of age that children spontaneously compute self-other similarity in the absence of explicit similarity messages. One explanation for our prior results is that preschool-age children are on the lookout for pedagogical messages specifically about their social environment. Yet another explanation holds that the mere flagging of the concepts same and different is sufficient to engender preferences for similar others. This explanation implies that when the concepts same and different are evoked, preschool-age children will notice and value self-other similarity. A key prerequisite for analogical reasoning, or the process of relating two distinct entities by virtue of their commonalities, is the ability to understand abstract relationships. One task often used to test this ability is known as the Relational Match-to-Sample (RMTS) task. Here, a potential application of analogical reasoning to social-cognitive development is investigated by assessing whether experience with a RMTS task implicitly directs young children\u2019s attention to similarities in the social domain. Specifically, in Study 1, whether a RMTS task will enable children to recognize physical trait similarities between themselves and others was assessed. Here 3and 4-year-olds were focused on, as prior work shows that although THE EFFECT OF RELATIONAL REASONING 3 3-year-olds attend to similarity cues in the form of explicit messages, only by age 4 do children generalize these cues. In Study 1, it was found that neither children 3 years of age nor 4 years of age generalized similarity information from an abstract context to the social domain when primed with a RMTS task. Therefore, in Study 2, whether an explicitly pedagogical explanation of concepts of same and different through the RMTS task would affect young children\u2019s selfresemblance preference was tested. Once again, it was found that, even when emphasizing the pedagogical component, the abstract information did not penetrate the social domain. These studies suggest that domain general processes do not account for children\u2019s social preferences, and instead, messages need to be based on specifically social information. Implications on effective interventions to mitigate biases are discussed. THE EFFECT OF RELATIONAL REASONING 4",

            "title": "The Inescapable Duality of Data and Knowledge",
            "abstract": "ion and Analogies One of the key issues underlying the debate about the effectiveness of data-driven approaches vs knowledge-based approaches is the source and the creator of abstractions [Mitchell 2021]. Data-driven approaches derive abstractions utilizing the trends and patterns explicit or implicit in the copious amounts of data, and its utility is tied to the representativeness of the data with respect to the domain of discourse. In contrast, knowledge-based approaches typically present abstractions that are obtained directly or indirectly by end-user applications and goals. Insofar as these two orthogonal approaches yield overlapping abstractions, we can use them synergistically. Further, their hybridization presents a viable strategy to leverage their complementary strengths. Data-driven abstractions can group values into coarser categories on the basis of data usage pattern but labelling them sensibly and developing abstractions with specific purpose usually requires human-in-the-loop. For instance, abstractions of temperature ranges and temperature thresholds that are relevant to different states of matter of water (such as ice, melting point, water, boiling point, and steam) are different from those relevant to human health (such as normal temperature, fever, mild fever, high fever, and chill). In circuit design, we can describe a full adder at different levels of abstraction in terms of two half-adders, or using logic gates (either using AND, OR and NOT gates, or NAND/NOR gates), or using flip-flop circuits, or using transistor netlists, etc. In the context of image recognition and transfer learning, the later stages of neural network layers capture higher-level abstractions/features that mirror the nature/components of the images in the training data and the end-user application, and probing them can improve our confidence in its working and provide insights about the potential limitations that can be addressed and remedied. Our effort in deep knowledge-infused learning (within the shallow, semi-dep and deep infusion variety [Sheth et al 2019]) is based on this intuition. Analogical reasoning involving primitive shapes (e.g., circle, square, and triangle) and their relationships (e.g., inside, outside, adjacent, above, below, left, right, and overlapping) in an image requires non-trivial human insights and geometric reasoning [Evans 1987]. In fact, this example presents an interesting situation where we can use deep learning algorithms to recognize primitive shapes and then use geometric analogical reasoning to solve non-trivial puzzles. As discussed above, there are several different motivations and applications for combining deeplearning powered neural networks with knowledge-based systems. Developing a modular framework to combine data-driven approaches that are effective at extracting useful features from low-level sensory and linguistic data, with declarative models of normal behavior such as through the incorporation of physical laws, medical knowledge, and linguistic knowledge, as well as anticipated failure modes and exceptions, can go a long way in leveraging insights from and exploiting the duality of data and knowledge.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in abstractive summarization tasks, delivering fluent and pertinent summaries. Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens. However, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source document(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to the summary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and position bias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 5 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5 evaluation metrics. We introduce a new evaluation benchmark called MiddleSum on the which we benchmark two alternative inference methods to alleviate position bias: hierarchical summarization and incremental summarization.",
