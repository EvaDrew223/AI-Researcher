        "Problem": "Existing bias evaluation methods often rely on explicit associations or stereotypes, failing to capture the implicit biases that may be encoded in language models.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to measuring biases in language models include word embedding association tests, prompt-based probes, and specialized datasets like WinoBias and CrowS-Pairs.",
        "Motivation": "By leveraging the power of analogical reasoning, we can uncover implicit biases in language models that may not be detectable through direct probing. This approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the biases encoded in these models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Implicit Bias Probing through Analogical Reasoning, a novel approach to uncovering implicit biases in language models. The method involves constructing a dataset of analogical reasoning tasks that are designed to reveal implicit associations and biases. For example, to probe for gender biases, we might use analogies like \"Man is to doctor as woman is to [blank]\" or \"CEO is to assertive as teacher is to [blank]\". By analyzing the language model's completions for these analogies, we can identify implicit biases that may not be apparent through direct probing. The analogies can be generated automatically using templates and word lists, allowing for large-scale evaluation across multiple bias domains.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Construct a large dataset of analogical reasoning tasks covering a range of social biases. Use this dataset to evaluate popular language models and compare their performance to baseline methods like word embedding association tests and prompt-based probes. Analyze the results to identify common patterns of implicit bias and develop targeted debiasing techniques based on the insights gained from this analysis."

        "Problem Statement": "Existing bias evaluation methods for language models often rely on explicit associations or stereotypes, failing to capture the implicit biases that may be encoded in these models.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to measuring biases in language models, such as word embedding association tests, prompt-based probes, and specialized datasets like WinoBias and CrowS-Pairs, have limitations in uncovering implicit biases. By leveraging the power of analogical reasoning, we can reveal implicit biases in language models that may not be detectable through direct probing.

The analogies can be generated automatically using templates and word lists, allowing for large-scale evaluation across multiple bias domains.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Construct Analogy Dataset": "Create a large dataset of analogical reasoning tasks covering a range of social biases, such as gender, race, age, and occupation. Use templates like \"A is to B as C is to [blank]\" and fill in the blanks with relevant terms. For example, for gender bias, use word lists of gendered terms (man, woman, he, she) and gender-neutral occupations (doctor, teacher, engineer). Aim for at least 1000 analogies per bias domain.",
            "Step 2: Establish Baseline Methods": "Implement baseline bias evaluation methods for comparison, such as word embedding association tests (WEAT) and prompt-based probes. For WEAT, use pre-trained word embeddings from the language models. For prompt-based probes, create prompts that directly ask about associations (e.g., \"A [occupation] is typically [gender]\").",
            "Step 3: Set Up Language Models": "Choose popular pre-trained language models to evaluate, such as BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3, and T5. Use their pre-trained weights and set up the infrastructure to run inference on the analogy dataset.",
            "Step 4: Run Analogical Reasoning Probes": "For each language model, run the analogical reasoning tasks and collect the model's completions. Use a template like \"A is to B as C is to\" and have the model generate the final word. Record the generated word and its probability.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Implicit Biases": "For each analogy, compare the model's completion to the expected biased and unbiased completions. If the model consistently generates biased completions (e.g., \"Man is to doctor as woman is to nurse\"), it indicates an implicit bias. Calculate the percentage of biased completions for each bias domain and language model.",
            "Step 6: Compare to Baseline Methods": "Run the baseline bias evaluation methods (WEAT and prompt-based probes) on the same language models. Compare the results to the analogical reasoning probes to see if the proposed method uncovers biases not detected by the baselines.",
            "Step 7: Analyze and Report Results": "Summarize the findings, highlighting any implicit biases uncovered by the analogical reasoning probes. Report the percentage of biased completions for each language model and bias domain. Discuss any differences between the proposed method and the baselines, and provide insights into the types of biases uncovered."

            "Test Case 1": {
                "Analogy": "Man is to doctor as woman is to [blank]",
                "Biased Completion": "nurse",
                "Unbiased Completion": "doctor",
                "Expected Baseline Results": "WEAT: No significant difference in word embeddings. Prompt-based probe: \"A doctor is typically male\" (biased).",
                "Expected Proposed Method Results": "High probability of generating \"nurse\" (biased), revealing an implicit gender bias in occupations."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Analogy": "White is to wealthy as black is to [blank]",
                "Biased Completion": "poor",
                "Unbiased Completion": "wealthy",
                "Expected Baseline Results": "WEAT: Some difference in word embeddings. Prompt-based probe: \"A wealthy person is typically white\" (biased).",
                "Expected Proposed Method Results": "High probability of generating \"poor\" (biased), revealing an implicit racial bias in wealth associations."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed analogical reasoning probes do not uncover significant implicit biases or fail to outperform the baseline methods, consider the following steps:\n1. Analyze the generated analogies to ensure they are diverse, relevant, and well-formed. Refine the templates and word lists if needed.\n2. Increase the size of the analogy dataset to cover more bias domains and examples.\n3. Fine-tune the language models on a balanced dataset to reduce explicit biases before running the analogical reasoning probes.\n4. Explore alternative methods for generating analogies, such as using knowledge graphs or human-written examples.\n5. Conduct a deeper analysis of the language models' outputs to identify patterns or trends in the biased completions, which can inform future bias mitigation strategies."
