    "idea_name": "Bias-Sensitive Prompt Engineering",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Off-the-shelf prompts used for generation tasks often contain biases and stereotypes that get amplified in the model's outputs.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods focus on debiasing the model itself, but do not address the biases introduced by the prompts used for generation.",
        "Motivation": "By carefully engineering prompts to be bias-sensitive and avoid stereotypical language or assumptions, we can reduce the biases in the model's outputs without the need for model retraining.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Bias-Sensitive Prompt Engineering (BSPE), a method for constructing prompts that are free of biases and stereotypes. BSPE involves identifying and removing biased language, assumptions, and stereotypes from prompts using a combination of manual analysis and automated tools. The resulting prompts would be neutral and inclusive, avoiding the introduction of biases into the model's outputs. BSPE can be applied to any existing prompt-based generation task.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate BSPE on a range of generation tasks, such as story generation and dialogue response generation. Compare the biases in the outputs generated using original prompts and bias-sensitive prompts. Measure the reduction in biased and stereotypical content using benchmark datasets such as StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs."

        "Title": "Bias-Sensitive Prompt Engineering for Reducing Social Biases and Stereotypes in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Off-the-shelf prompts used for generation tasks often contain biases and stereotypes that get amplified in the model's outputs, leading to the generation of biased and stereotypical content.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for debiasing language models primarily focus on modifying the model itself through techniques like data balancing, adversarial training, or post-processing. However, these approaches do not address the biases introduced by the prompts used for generation. We propose that by carefully engineering prompts to be bias-sensitive and avoid stereotypical language or assumptions, we can reduce the biases in the model's outputs without the need for expensive model retraining. This approach is inspired by the effectiveness of prompting techniques in guiding language model behavior for various tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Bias-Sensitive Prompt Engineering (BSPE), a method for constructing prompts that are free of biases and stereotypes. BSPE involves the following steps:\n1. Identifying biased language, assumptions, and stereotypes in existing prompts through a combination of manual analysis and automated tools.\n2. Removing or rephrasing the identified biased elements to create neutral and inclusive prompts.\n3. Validating the bias-sensitive prompts through human evaluation and fairness metrics.\n4. Applying the resulting prompts to generation tasks and comparing the outputs with those from the original prompts.\nBSPE can be applied to any existing prompt-based generation task, making it a flexible and generalizable approach.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will evaluate BSPE on two types of generation tasks: (1) story generation using the ROCStories dataset, and (2) dialogue response generation using the EmpatheticDialogues dataset. These datasets are chosen because they involve open-ended generation and have the potential to exhibit social biases.",
            "Step 2: Prompt Analysis and Modification": "For each dataset, we will:\n1. Randomly sample a subset of prompts (e.g., 100 prompts per dataset).\n2. Manually analyze the prompts to identify biased language, assumptions, and stereotypes, focusing on aspects such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, and occupation.\n3. Use automated tools like the Perspective API or the Bias in Bios dataset to detect potentially biased content.\n4. Create bias-sensitive versions of the prompts by removing or rephrasing the identified biased elements. For example, a prompt like \"The woman was cooking dinner for her family\" could be modified to \"The person was cooking dinner for their family\".\n5. Validate the bias-sensitive prompts through human evaluation, ensuring that they maintain coherence and relevance to the original task.",
            "Step 3: Model Selection": "We will use GPT-3 (davinci) and GPT-Neo (2.7B) as the language models for our experiments. These models are chosen due to their strong performance on generation tasks and their public accessibility.",
            "Step 4: Generation and Evaluation": "For each combination of dataset, model, and prompt type (original vs. bias-sensitive), we will:\n1. Generate outputs for the test set prompts.\n2. Evaluate the generated outputs using both automated metrics and human evaluation:\n   - Automated metrics: Measure the reduction in biased and stereotypical content using tools like the Perspective API and the Bias in Bios dataset. Also compute language quality metrics like perplexity and diversity.\n   - Human evaluation: Have annotators rate the outputs on criteria like bias, coherence, and overall quality.\n3. Compare the results between the original and bias-sensitive prompts to assess the effectiveness of BSPE.",
            "Step 5: Analysis and Reporting": "1. Conduct statistical analysis to determine if there are significant differences in the evaluation metrics between the original and bias-sensitive prompts.\n2. Qualitatively analyze the generated outputs to identify common patterns and differences in the types of biases and stereotypes present.\n3. Report the findings, discussing the effectiveness of BSPE, its limitations, and potential future improvements."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Original Prompt (Story Generation)": "Sarah, a young woman, was always interested in science. She decided to pursue a career in",
            "Original Prompt Output": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be a difficult time for you. Have you considered looking for similar positions in other companies? With your experience as a receptionist, I'm sure you have valuable skills that many businesses would appreciate. Don't lose hope - keep applying and networking, and I'm confident you'll find a new opportunity soon. In the meantime, make sure to take care of yourself and lean on your support system. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help!",
            "Bias-Sensitive Prompt (Story Generation)": "Sarah was always interested in science. They decided to pursue a career in",
            "Bias-Sensitive Prompt Output": "I'm sorry to hear about your job loss. That's a tough situation to be in. It's understandable that you're struggling - losing a job can be a big blow both financially and emotionally. Remember that your job doesn't define your worth, and that many successful people have gone through similar challenges. Take some time to process your feelings, but also start thinking about your next steps. Consider your skills and interests, and explore opportunities in various fields. Reach out to your network for leads and support. And don't hesitate to seek help if you need it, whether that's financial assistance, career counseling, or just someone to talk to. You'll get through this.",
            "Explanation": "The original prompt assumes that the person who lost their job was a receptionist, which could be based on gender stereotypes. The bias-sensitive prompt removes the specific job title, making the conversation more neutral. The resulting output provides general support and advice without making assumptions about the person's previous job or skills.",
            "Original Prompt (Dialogue Generation)": "Person A: I just got laid off from my job as a receptionist. I'm really struggling.\nPerson B:",
            "Bias-Sensitive Prompt (Dialogue Generation)": "Person A: I just got laid off from my job. I'm really struggling.\nPerson B:"
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed BSPE method does not significantly reduce biases and stereotypes in the generated outputs compared to the original prompts, we can explore the following alternatives:\n1. Analyze the bias-sensitive prompts to identify any remaining biases or areas for improvement. Refine the prompts further based on this analysis.\n2. Investigate the use of additional debiasing techniques in combination with BSPE, such as fine-tuning the language models on bias-balanced datasets or using post-processing methods to filter biased content.\n3. Conduct a more in-depth human evaluation to understand the limitations of BSPE and gather insights for future improvements. This could involve collecting feedback from a diverse group of annotators and analyzing the types of biases that are more challenging to mitigate through prompting alone.\n4. If the results suggest that prompt engineering alone is insufficient for reducing biases, pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations and challenges of prompt-based debiasing. This could involve comparing BSPE with other debiasing approaches, examining the trade-offs between bias reduction and other aspects of language quality, and proposing new research directions for more effective bias mitigation in language models."
