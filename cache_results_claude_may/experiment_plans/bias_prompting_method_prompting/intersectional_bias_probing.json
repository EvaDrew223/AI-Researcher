        "Problem": "Current bias evaluation methods often focus on a single demographic attribute (e.g., gender or race) and fail to capture intersectional biases that arise from the interaction of multiple attributes.",
        "Existing Methods": "Most existing bias benchmarks and metrics consider only one demographic attribute at a time, such as gender bias or racial bias.",
        "Motivation": "Intersectional biases, such as those faced by individuals with multiple marginalized identities, can be more complex and harmful than single-attribute biases. By probing for intersectional biases, we can better understand and mitigate the biases in language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Intersectional Bias Probing (IBP), a method for evaluating the intersectional biases in language models using carefully designed prompts. IBP involves constructing prompts that combine multiple demographic attributes (e.g., a woman of color with a disability) and comparing the model's outputs to those for prompts with a single attribute (e.g., a woman, a person of color, or a person with a disability). By analyzing the differences in the model's responses, we can identify and quantify intersectional biases that may not be apparent when considering single attributes alone.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Construct a dataset of intersectional bias probes covering a range of demographic attribute combinations. Evaluate popular language models using IBP and compare the results to single-attribute bias benchmarks. Analyze the types and magnitudes of intersectional biases identified and propose targeted mitigation strategies."

        "Title": "Intersectional Bias Probing: Evaluating Language Models for Biases Arising from Intersecting Demographic Attributes",
        "Problem Statement": "Current bias evaluation methods for language models often focus on a single demographic attribute (e.g., gender or race) and fail to capture intersectional biases that arise from the interaction of multiple attributes.",
        "Motivation": "Existing bias benchmarks and metrics typically consider only one demographic attribute at a time, such as gender bias or racial bias. However, intersectional biases, such as those faced by individuals with multiple marginalized identities, can be more complex and harmful than single-attribute biases. By probing for intersectional biases, we can better understand and mitigate the biases in language models. Our proposed method, Intersectional Bias Probing (IBP), involves constructing prompts that combine multiple demographic attributes and comparing the model's outputs to those for prompts with a single attribute. This approach allows us to identify and quantify intersectional biases that may not be apparent when considering single attributes alone.",
        "Proposed Method": "Intersectional Bias Probing (IBP) is a method for evaluating the intersectional biases in language models using carefully designed prompts. The key steps are:\n1. Construct a dataset of intersectional bias probes covering a range of demographic attribute combinations.\n2. For each probe, generate prompts that combine multiple demographic attributes (e.g., a woman of color with a disability) and prompts with a single attribute (e.g., a woman, a person of color, or a person with a disability).\n3. Query the language model with both the intersectional and single-attribute prompts.\n4. Compare the model's outputs for the intersectional prompts to those for the single-attribute prompts.\n5. Analyze the differences in the model's responses to identify and quantify intersectional biases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Define Demographic Attributes": "Select a set of demographic attributes to focus on, such as gender, race, age, disability status, and sexual orientation. For each attribute, define a list of possible values (e.g., for gender: male, female, non-binary).",
            "Step 2: Construct Intersectional Bias Probes": "Create a dataset of bias probes that cover a range of attribute combinations. Each probe should consist of a base sentence or question that can be modified to include different demographic attributes. For example, a base probe could be \"[PERSON] is a skilled [PROFESSION].\", where [PERSON] and [PROFESSION] are placeholders for demographic attributes and professions, respectively.",
            "Step 3: Generate Prompts": "For each bias probe, generate prompts by filling in the placeholders with specific demographic attributes. Create both intersectional prompts (e.g., \"A Black woman with a disability is a skilled software engineer.\") and single-attribute prompts (e.g., \"A woman is a skilled software engineer.\", \"A Black person is a skilled software engineer.\", \"A person with a disability is a skilled software engineer.\").",
            "Step 4: Query Language Models": "Select popular language models to evaluate, such as GPT-3, BERT, and RoBERTa. For each model, query it with both the intersectional and single-attribute prompts. Record the model's outputs for each prompt.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Compare the model's outputs for the intersectional prompts to those for the single-attribute prompts. Look for differences in sentiment, stereotyping, or other biases. Quantify the intersectional biases by calculating metrics such as the difference in average sentiment scores between intersectional and single-attribute prompts.",
            "Step 6: Propose Mitigation Strategies": "Based on the identified intersectional biases, propose targeted mitigation strategies. These could include data augmentation techniques to balance the representation of different attribute combinations in the training data, or post-processing methods to adjust the model's outputs to reduce biases."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Base Probe": "[PERSON] is a skilled [PROFESSION].",
            "Intersectional Prompt": "A Black woman with a disability is a skilled software engineer.",
            "Single-Attribute Prompts": [
                "A woman is a skilled software engineer.",
                "A Black person is a skilled software engineer.",
                "A person with a disability is a skilled software engineer."
            ],
            "Expected Results": "The model's outputs for the intersectional prompt may exhibit more negative sentiment or stereotyping compared to the single-attribute prompts. For example, the model might generate continuations that question the competence of a Black woman with a disability in a technical field, while generating more positive or neutral continuations for the single-attribute prompts.",
            "Explanation": "By comparing the model's responses to intersectional and single-attribute prompts, we can identify biases that arise from the interaction of multiple demographic attributes. In this example, the model may exhibit biases against individuals with multiple marginalized identities (e.g., a Black woman with a disability) that are not apparent when considering single attributes alone."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Intersectional Bias Probing method does not reveal significant intersectional biases, there are several alternative analyses and extensions that can be pursued:\n1. Expand the set of demographic attributes and attribute combinations to cover a wider range of intersectional identities.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt templates and wordings on the model's responses and the detectability of intersectional biases.\n3. Compare the results of Intersectional Bias Probing across different language models and model sizes to identify factors that may contribute to or mitigate intersectional biases.\n4. Conduct human evaluations to validate the identified intersectional biases and gather insights on their potential harms and mitigation strategies.\n5. Develop a more comprehensive framework for quantifying and comparing intersectional biases across different models and datasets.\nBy pursuing these alternative analyses and extensions, the project can still provide valuable insights into the nature and extent of intersectional biases in language models, even if the initial Intersectional Bias Probing method does not yield significant results."
