        "Problem": "Language models can often generate text that contains implicit biases and stereotypes, which may not be immediately apparent to users. Identifying and mitigating these biases is challenging, as they can be subtle and context-dependent.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for measuring implicit bias in language models include the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). Baseline methods for reducing implicit bias include data augmentation and adversarial training.",
        "Motivation": "Socratic questioning is a teaching method that involves asking probing questions to encourage critical thinking and expose underlying assumptions. By applying this technique to the prompting process, we can potentially uncover and challenge the implicit biases present in language models, leading to the generation of more neutral and unbiased text.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a Socratic questioning framework for bias exposure and reduction in language models. The framework consists of a series of prompts designed to probe the language model's underlying assumptions and biases. For example, when generating text about a particular demographic group, the framework might ask questions like \"What evidence supports this characterization?\" or \"Can you think of counter-examples that challenge this stereotype?\". The language model's responses to these questions are then used to generate follow-up prompts that further probe and challenge its biases. This iterative process continues until the generated text is deemed sufficiently unbiased by a pre-defined criterion (e.g., a threshold on a bias metric).",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on datasets that measure implicit bias, such as the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC) and the Bias in Bios dataset. Compare its performance to baseline methods like data augmentation and adversarial training. Conduct human evaluations to assess the effectiveness of the Socratic questioning process in exposing and reducing bias."

        "Title": "Socratic Questioning for Bias Exposure and Reduction in Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Language models can generate text that contains implicit biases and stereotypes, which may not be immediately apparent to users. Identifying and mitigating these biases is challenging, as they can be subtle and context-dependent.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for measuring and reducing implicit bias in language models, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT), Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT), data augmentation, and adversarial training, have limitations. They may not effectively capture the full range of biases or require extensive labeled data. Socratic questioning, a teaching method that involves asking probing questions to encourage critical thinking and expose underlying assumptions, has the potential to uncover and challenge the implicit biases present in language models. By applying this technique to the prompting process, we aim to generate more neutral and unbiased text.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a Socratic questioning framework for bias exposure and reduction in language models. The framework consists of a series of prompts designed to probe the language model's underlying assumptions and biases. For example, when generating text about a particular demographic group, the framework might ask questions like \"What evidence supports this characterization?\" or \"Can you think of counter-examples that challenge this stereotype?\".

This iterative process continues until the generated text is deemed sufficiently unbiased by a pre-defined criterion (e.g., a threshold on a bias metric).",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Select Datasets": "Choose datasets that measure implicit bias, such as the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC) and the Bias in Bios dataset. These datasets contain text snippets with annotations for various types of biases (e.g., gender, race, age).",
            "Step 2: Prepare Baseline Methods": "Implement baseline methods for reducing implicit bias, such as data augmentation (e.g., gender swapping) and adversarial training. For data augmentation, create additional training examples by swapping gender-specific terms. For adversarial training, train a discriminator to distinguish between biased and unbiased text, and use it to penalize the language model during training.",
            "Step 3: Develop Socratic Questioning Prompts": "Create a set of Socratic questioning prompts that probe for biases in generated text. Example prompts include:\n- \"What assumptions are being made about [demographic group]?\"\n- \"Is this a fair and accurate representation of [demographic group]? Why or why not?\"\n- \"Can you provide examples that contradict this stereotype?\"\n- \"How might someone from [demographic group] feel about this characterization?\"",
            "Step 4: Implement Iterative Prompting": "Develop a system that iteratively prompts the language model with Socratic questions based on its generated text. The system should:\n1. Generate an initial text snippet about a demographic group.\n2. Apply Socratic questioning prompts to the generated text.\n3. Use the language model's responses to generate follow-up prompts.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a threshold on a bias metric).\n5. Return the final generated text.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Bias Reduction": "Measure the implicit bias in the generated text using metrics such as the Bias in Bios score or the Equity Evaluation Corpus score. Compare the bias scores of the proposed method to those of the baseline methods.",
            "Step 6: Conduct Human Evaluation": "Have human annotators evaluate the generated text for quality and bias. Provide annotators with text snippets generated by the proposed method and baseline methods, and ask them to rate the text on criteria such as coherence, fluency, and perceived bias. Analyze the human evaluation results to assess the effectiveness of the Socratic questioning approach.",
            "Step 7: Analyze and Iterate": "Examine the results of the bias metrics and human evaluation to identify strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method. Iterate on the Socratic questioning prompts and the iterative prompting system based on these findings. For example, if certain types of biases are not effectively addressed, develop new prompts that specifically target those biases."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Socratic questioning method does not effectively reduce implicit bias in the generated text, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated Socratic questions and responses to identify patterns or limitations. Are the questions not probing deeply enough, or are they focusing on the wrong aspects? Use this analysis to refine the questioning prompts.\n2. Experiment with different bias metrics and thresholds for the stopping criterion. Some bias metrics may be more sensitive to certain types of biases, so using a combination of metrics could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n3. Investigate alternative prompting techniques, such as counterfactual prompting (e.g., \"How would this description change if the person belonged to a different demographic group?\") or role reversal (e.g., \"Imagine you are a member of the demographic group being described. How would you feel about this characterization?\").\n4. Consider combining the Socratic questioning approach with other bias reduction techniques, such as fine-tuning the language model on a balanced dataset or using a post-processing step to filter out biased text.\n5. If the bias reduction results are inconsistent or not significant enough, pivot the project to focus on bias exposure rather than reduction. Use the Socratic questioning framework to generate explanations of the biases present in the language model's outputs, and present these explanations alongside the generated text to raise awareness among users."
