    "idea_name": "Bias-Sensitivity-Aware Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs can produce biased outputs that discriminate against certain social groups, particularly in high-stakes domains like hiring, healthcare, and criminal justice.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for reducing bias in high-stakes applications of LLMs include using debiased training data, employing fairness constraints during decoding, and post-processing outputs to remove biased language.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a prompting method that makes the model aware of its own potential biases and encourages it to generate outputs that are sensitive to bias-related harms. By explicitly highlighting the bias sensitivity of the task at hand, we aim to make the model more cautious and equitable in its outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Bias-Sensitivity-Aware Prompting (BSAP), a method that constructs prompts with bias sensitivity warnings. For each input prompt, BSAP first assesses the bias sensitivity of the task based on predefined criteria (e.g., involving protected attributes, making high-stakes decisions). If the task is deemed bias-sensitive, BSAP appends a warning message that highlights the potential for bias-related harms and encourages the model to be extra cautious in its response. For example, if the prompt is about hiring decisions, BSAP might append a warning like \"[BIAS SENSITIVITY WARNING: This task involves making hiring decisions, which can have significant impacts on people's lives. Be aware of potential biases related to gender, race, age, and other protected attributes, and strive for fairness and equality in your response.]\". The model is then conditioned on the bias-sensitivity-aware prompt to generate outputs that are more mindful of bias-related risks.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate BSAP on high-stakes tasks that are sensitive to bias, such as resume screening, risk assessment, and medical diagnosis. Compare with baselines like vanilla prompting and debiased fine-tuning. Measure fairness using metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds. Conduct human evaluations to assess the bias sensitivity and fairness of the generated outputs, as well as their utility for the task at hand."

        "Title": "Bias-Sensitivity-Aware Prompting: Reducing Social Biases in Language Model Outputs",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce biased outputs that discriminate against certain social groups, particularly in high-stakes domains like hiring, healthcare, and criminal justice. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed for the safe and responsible deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for mitigating biases in LLMs, such as debiasing the training data, applying fairness constraints during decoding, or post-processing the outputs, have shown some effectiveness but still face limitations. They often require extensive data annotation, careful hyperparameter tuning, or sacrifice output fluency. We propose a novel prompting strategy, Bias-Sensitivity-Aware Prompting (BSAP), which aims to make the model aware of its own potential biases and encourages it to generate outputs that are sensitive to bias-related harms. By explicitly highlighting the bias sensitivity of the task at hand through the prompt, we hypothesize that the model will be more cautious and equitable in its outputs, without the need for expensive debiasing procedures.",
        "Proposed Method": "BSAP works as follows: For each input prompt, we first assess the bias sensitivity of the task based on predefined criteria (e.g., involving protected attributes, making high-stakes decisions). If the task is deemed bias-sensitive, we append a warning message to the prompt that highlights the potential for bias-related harms and encourages the model to be extra cautious in its response. For example, if the prompt is about hiring decisions, BSAP might append a warning like \"[BIAS SENSITIVITY WARNING: This task involves making hiring decisions, which can have significant impacts on people's lives. Be aware of potential biases related to gender, race, age, and other protected attributes, and strive for fairness and equality in your response.]\". The model is then conditioned on this bias-sensitivity-aware prompt to generate the final output. We hypothesize that this simple yet effective intervention can substantially reduce biases in the model's outputs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate BSAP on three datasets that involve bias-sensitive tasks: (1) The Bias in Bios dataset, which contains biographies with varying degrees of gender bias. (2) The BOLD dataset, which tests models' biases in open-ended language generation. (3) A synthetic dataset of hiring decision prompts, where the goal is to assess candidates' qualifications fairly regardless of protected attributes.",
            "Step 2: Define Bias Sensitivity Criteria": "We will define a set of criteria for determining whether a task is bias-sensitive. These may include: (1) Explicit mentions of protected attributes like race, gender, age, etc. (2) Language indicative of high-stakes decisions, e.g., hiring, medical diagnosis, criminal judgment. (3) Potential for disparate impact on different social groups. These criteria will be used to trigger the addition of bias warnings in BSAP.",
            "Step 3: Construct Prompts": "For each example in the datasets, we will construct two prompts: (1) The baseline prompt, which simply consists of the task description or input text. (2) The BSAP prompt, which appends a bias warning to the baseline prompt if the task is deemed bias-sensitive according to our predefined criteria. The exact wording of the warnings can be varied to assess robustness. Some examples:\n[BIAS SENSITIVITY WARNING: This task involves making hiring decisions, which can have significant impacts on people's lives. Be aware of potential biases related to gender, race, age, and other protected attributes, and strive for fairness and equality in your response.]\n[BIAS SENSITIVITY WARNING: The following biography may contain biased language that reflects stereotypes about certain genders. Be cautious not to perpetuate these biases in your analysis or response.]\n[BIAS SENSITIVITY WARNING: The following text discusses a sensitive topic that has the potential to impact various social groups differently. Strive to be objective and impartial in your response, avoiding language that could be offensive or discriminatory.]",
            "Step 4: Select Models": "We will evaluate BSAP on 3 models: GPT-3 (davinci), GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), and GPT-4. This will allow us to assess the effectiveness of BSAP across models of varying sizes and capabilities.",
            "Step 5: Generate Outputs": "For each example in the datasets, we will generate outputs from each model using both the baseline and BSAP prompts. We will use a fixed sampling strategy across all models and prompts to ensure fair comparisons.",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Bias": "We will measure the bias in the generated outputs using both automated and human evaluation. For automated evaluation, we will use tools like Jigsaw's Perspective API to measure the toxicity and bias in the outputs. We will also define a set of keywords and phrases indicative of bias against different groups, and measure their frequency in the outputs. For human evaluation, we will have annotators rate the outputs on criteria like professionalism, fairness, and lack of bias. The annotators will be blinded to the prompts used to generate each output.",
            "Step 7: Analyze Results": "We will compare the bias measurements between the baseline and BSAP outputs, both within and across models. We hypothesize that BSAP will significantly reduce biases compared to the baseline, across all models and datasets. We will also analyze the impact of different phrasings of the bias warnings, to identify the most effective ways to prompt the models for fairness. Finally, we will conduct error analyses to understand the limitations of BSAP and identify avenues for future work."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Evaluate the following candidate for a software engineering position: Anna is a 29-year-old woman with 4 years of experience as a software developer. She has a bachelor's degree in computer science from a top university. In her previous role, she led the development of a successful mobile app with over 1 million downloads. However, she took a 1-year break from work to care for her newborn child.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Anna seems to be a qualified candidate for the software engineering position, with relevant education and work experience. However, her 1-year break to care for her child may raise concerns about her commitment to the job and ability to keep up with the fast-paced tech industry. As a young woman, she may also face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities. I would recommend proceeding with caution and thoroughly evaluating her current skills and motivation before making a hiring decision.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "[BIAS SENSITIVITY WARNING: This task involves making hiring decisions, which can have significant impacts on people's lives. Be aware of potential biases related to gender, age, parental status, and other protected attributes, and strive for fairness and equality in your response.]\nEvaluate the following candidate for a software engineering position: Anna is a 29-year-old woman with 4 years of experience as a software developer. She has a bachelor's degree in computer science from a top university. In her previous role, she led the development of a successful mobile app with over 1 million downloads. However, she took a 1-year break from work to care for her newborn child.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Anna appears to be a highly qualified candidate for the software engineering position. Her bachelor's degree in computer science from a top university and 4 years of relevant work experience demonstrate a strong educational and professional background. Her leadership in developing a successful mobile app with over 1 million downloads showcases her technical skills and ability to deliver impactful products.\nRegarding her 1-year break to care for her newborn child, this should not be viewed as a negative factor in the hiring decision. Taking time off for parental responsibilities is a normal and valid choice that should not reflect poorly on a candidate's commitment or abilities. Many talented professionals balance work and family successfully, and parental leaves are protected by law in many jurisdictions.\nAs an equal opportunity employer, it is crucial to evaluate candidates based solely on their qualifications, skills, and potential to contribute to the role and the company. Factors like gender, age, or parental status should not influence the hiring decision. Anna's track record suggests that she is a competent and accomplished software engineer who could bring valuable expertise to the team.\nI recommend inviting Anna for an interview to further discuss her qualifications, experience, and interest in the position. The interview process should focus on her technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and alignment with the company's values and culture, while avoiding any biased or discriminatory questions. If she demonstrates the necessary capabilities and fit for the role, she should be considered a strong candidate for the software engineering position.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline output, generated without the bias sensitivity warning, contains several biased statements and assumptions. It suggests that Anna's break for childcare may indicate a lack of commitment to work, perpetuating harmful stereotypes about women and mothers in the workplace. It also implies that her gender and age could be challenges, without any evidence to support these claims.\nIn contrast, the output generated with BSAP acknowledges Anna's strong qualifications and experience, and explicitly states that her parental leave should not be viewed negatively. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating candidates based on their skills and potential, rather than protected attributes like gender or parental status. The response also provides actionable recommendations for conducting a fair and unbiased interview process.\nBy making the model aware of the potential for bias and encouraging it to focus on the candidate's qualifications, BSAP helps generate a more objective and equitable evaluation. This example demonstrates how a simple prompt intervention can significantly reduce biased language and promote fairness in high-stakes decision-making tasks."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the BSAP method does not significantly reduce biases compared to the baselines, we will conduct additional analyses to understand the limitations and inform future directions:\n1. Analyze the types of biases that persist despite the warnings, and identify patterns or commonalities among them. This can help refine the bias sensitivity criteria and warning language to better target these specific biases.\n2. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of BSAP, such as the phrasing of the warnings, the specificity of the criteria, or the placement of the warnings in the prompt. This can help identify the most effective elements of the intervention and optimize the prompting strategy.\n3. Investigate whether the effectiveness of BSAP varies across different models, datasets, or types of tasks. This can provide insights into the generalizability of the method and identify areas where more targeted interventions may be needed.\n4. Explore combining BSAP with other bias mitigation techniques, such as fine-tuning on diverse and inclusive datasets, or post-processing outputs to remove biased language. Evaluating the complementary effects of these approaches can inform the development of more comprehensive bias reduction frameworks.\n5. Conduct human evaluations to assess the perceived fairness, professionalism, and appropriateness of the BSAP outputs compared to the baselines. Gather feedback from diverse annotators to identify any blind spots or unintended consequences of the prompting strategy.\nBy leveraging these additional analyses and experiments, we can gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of BSAP, even if the initial results do not meet our expectations. These insights can inform future research directions and help refine the method to better address the complex challenge of reducing biases in language model outputs. Ultimately, this work can contribute to the development of more responsible and equitable AI systems, even if the specific proposed method requires further iteration and improvement."
