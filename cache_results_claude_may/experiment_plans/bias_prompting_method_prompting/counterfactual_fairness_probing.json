    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Language models can encode and perpetuate unfair associations between social groups and outcomes, leading to biased predictions in downstream tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Many bias evaluation approaches focus on detecting stereotypical associations but do not directly measure the fairness of model predictions across groups.",
        "Motivation": "To assess and mitigate unfairness in language model predictions, we need evaluation frameworks that directly probe for disparities in outcomes across social groups. By generating counterfactual test cases that vary sensitive attributes, we can isolate the effect of group membership on model outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Fairness Probing (CFP), a framework for measuring and mitigating unfairness in language model predictions. CFP involves: 1) Defining a set of sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race) and target outcomes (e.g., predicted sentiment, toxicity score) relevant to a given task. 2) Generating counterfactual test cases by varying the sensitive attributes in an input prompt while holding other factors constant. 3) Prompting the language model to predict the target outcome for each counterfactual case. 4) Measuring disparities in predicted outcomes across groups and computing fairness metrics like demographic parity.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Apply CFP to popular language models across tasks like sentiment analysis, toxicity detection, and content moderation. Compare the fairness gaps revealed by CFP to those detected by existing bias benchmarks. Develop debiasing techniques that equalize outcomes across counterfactual groups and evaluate their effectiveness using CFP."

        "Problem Statement": "Language models can encode and perpetuate unfair associations between social groups and outcomes, leading to biased predictions in downstream tasks. Existing bias evaluation approaches focus on detecting stereotypical associations but do not directly measure the fairness of model predictions across groups.",
        "Motivation": "To assess and mitigate unfairness in language model predictions, we need evaluation frameworks that directly probe for disparities in outcomes across social groups. By generating counterfactual test cases that vary sensitive attributes, we can isolate the effect of group membership on model outputs. This allows us to quantify fairness gaps and develop targeted debiasing techniques to equalize outcomes.",
        "Proposed Method": "Counterfactual Fairness Probing (CFP) is a framework for measuring and mitigating unfairness in language model predictions. CFP involves: \n1) Defining a set of sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race) and target outcomes (e.g., predicted sentiment, toxicity score) relevant to a given task. \n2) Generating counterfactual test cases by varying the sensitive attributes in an input prompt while holding other factors constant. \n3) Prompting the language model to predict the target outcome for each counterfactual case. \n4) Measuring disparities in predicted outcomes across groups and computing fairness metrics like demographic parity. \n5) Developing debiasing techniques that equalize outcomes across counterfactual groups.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Select Tasks and Datasets": "Choose 2-3 language tasks where social biases could lead to unfair outcomes, such as sentiment analysis, toxicity detection, and content moderation. For each task, identify an existing dataset or collect a new dataset of input prompts. The datasets should have a mix of examples referencing different social groups.",
            "Step 2: Define Sensitive Attributes and Target Outcomes": "For each task, define the sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, religion) and target outcomes (e.g., sentiment score, toxicity score, moderation decision) to be analyzed. Create a set of attribute values for each sensitive attribute (e.g., 'male' and 'female' for gender).",
            "Step 3: Generate Counterfactual Test Cases": "For each input prompt in the datasets, generate counterfactual versions by varying the sensitive attributes. This can be done by identifying and substituting group-related tokens (e.g., names, pronouns) or by using templates with fill-in-the-blank sensitive attributes. The counterfactual prompts should minimize changes to other parts of the input. Aim to generate at least 100 counterfactual cases per original prompt.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Language Models for Predictions": "Select 2-3 popular pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, RoBERTa) to evaluate. For each task and model, prompt the model with the original and counterfactual test cases to predict the target outcomes. Use the model's default inference settings and prompts optimized for the task.",
            "Step 5: Measure Fairness Gaps": "For each task and model, compare the predicted outcomes across the counterfactual groups. Compute fairness metrics such as demographic parity (i.e., equal positive rates across groups) and equalized odds (i.e., equal true positive and false positive rates across groups). Analyze the magnitude and direction of the fairness gaps.",
            "Step 6: Develop Debiasing Techniques": "Develop techniques to mitigate the measured fairness gaps. This can include: 1) Prompt engineering: Design prompts that encourage the model to focus on relevant features and ignore sensitive attributes. 2) Fine-tuning with balanced data: Fine-tune the model on a dataset with equal representation of social groups. 3) Adversarial debiasing: Train the model to predict the target outcome while minimizing the ability to predict sensitive attributes.",
            "Step 7: Evaluate Debiasing Techniques": "Apply the debiasing techniques to the language models and re-evaluate their fairness using the CFP framework. Compare the fairness metrics before and after debiasing to assess the effectiveness of each technique. Analyze any trade-offs between fairness and overall task performance.",
            "Step 8: Validate on Real-World Data": "To assess the generalizability of the findings, apply the CFP framework and debiasing techniques to a held-out set of real-world data for each task. Measure the fairness gaps and performance of the debiased models on this data.",
            "Step 9: Compare to Baselines": "Compare the results of the CFP framework to existing bias evaluation methods that measure stereotypical associations (e.g., WEAT, SEAT). Analyze the extent to which reducing stereotypical associations translates to fairer outcomes on downstream tasks.",
            "Step 10: Analyze and Report Results": "Summarize the findings in a research paper. Report the fairness gaps discovered by CFP across tasks and models, the effectiveness of different debiasing techniques, and any trade-offs between fairness and performance. Discuss the implications for responsible deployment of language models in real-world applications."

                "Task": "Sentiment Analysis",
                "Original Prompt": "John was excited to start his new job at the prestigious law firm.",
                "Counterfactual Prompt": "Shaniqua was excited to start her new job at the prestigious law firm.",

                "Proposed Method Output Explanation": "The model predicts equally positive sentiment for both John and Shaniqua after applying the debiasing techniques, closing the fairness gap."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Task": "Toxicity Detection",
                "Original Prompt": "Mark said he didn't like the new superhero movie because it had too much violence.",
                "Counterfactual Prompt": "Fatima said she didn't like the new superhero movie because it had too much violence.",
                "Sensitive Attribute": "Religion (implied by name)",
                "Target Outcome": "Toxicity Score",
                "Baseline Output": "Mark: Non-toxic (score: 0.1), Fatima: Toxic (score: 0.7)",
                "Baseline Output Explanation": "The model predicts Fatima's opinion as much more toxic than Mark's, despite expressing the same sentiment.",
                "Proposed Method Output": "Mark: Non-toxic (score: 0.1), Fatima: Non-toxic (score: 0.1)",
                "Proposed Method Output Explanation": "The debiased model predicts both opinions as equally non-toxic, mitigating the unfair association between Fatima's name and toxicity."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed debiasing techniques do not effectively mitigate the fairness gaps, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1) Analyze the failure modes of the debiasing techniques. Examine cases where the techniques did not work as expected and try to identify patterns or common causes.\n2) Collect a larger and more diverse dataset for fine-tuning and evaluation. The current datasets may not adequately capture the full range of social biases.\n3) Experiment with different model architectures or training objectives that are more amenable to debiasing, such as adversarial training or multi-task learning.\n4) Develop interpretability methods to better understand how the model is making predictions and what features it is relying on. This can guide the development of more targeted debiasing interventions.\n5) Collaborate with domain experts in social science, ethics, and fairness to get feedback on the methodology and brainstorm alternative approaches.\nIf the debiasing techniques consistently fail to improve fairness, the project can pivot to an in-depth analysis of the limitations and challenges of mitigating social biases in language models. The analysis can cover topics such as the trade-offs between fairness and performance, the role of the training data in shaping model biases, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in developing fair AI systems. The insights from this analysis can inform future research directions and best practices for responsible AI development."
