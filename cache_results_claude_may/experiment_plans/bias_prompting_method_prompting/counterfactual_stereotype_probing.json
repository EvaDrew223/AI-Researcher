        "Problem": "Language models can perpetuate harmful stereotypes by generating biased content, but existing evaluation methods may not fully capture the extent and nature of these stereotypes.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current bias evaluation methods often rely on measuring associations between target words and attribute words, or comparing the model's outputs for different demographic groups.",
        "Motivation": "By probing the model's outputs for counterfactual scenarios that challenge stereotypes, we can better understand the extent to which the model relies on stereotypical assumptions and identify specific stereotypes that need to be addressed.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Stereotype Probing (CSP), a method for evaluating the stereotypes present in a language model's outputs. CSP involves generating counterfactual scenarios that challenge common stereotypes and comparing the model's outputs to its outputs for stereotypical scenarios. For example, if a common stereotype associates a profession with a particular gender, CSP would generate a counterfactual scenario with a person of a different gender in that profession. By analyzing the differences in the model's outputs between the stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios, we can identify the specific stereotypes the model relies on and quantify their impact.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Construct a dataset of stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios for a range of common stereotypes. Evaluate popular language models using CSP and compare the results to existing bias benchmarks. Analyze the types of stereotypes identified and the magnitude of their impact on the model's outputs. Use the insights gained from CSP to develop targeted bias mitigation strategies."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Stereotype Probing: Evaluating and Mitigating Stereotypes in Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Language models can perpetuate harmful stereotypes by generating biased content, but existing evaluation methods may not fully capture the extent and nature of these stereotypes. We need better ways to probe for stereotypes in language models and develop targeted mitigation strategies.",
        "Motivation": "Existing bias evaluation methods often rely on measuring associations between target words and attribute words, or comparing the model's outputs for different demographic groups. However, these methods may not uncover the full range of stereotypes present in the model. By probing the model's outputs for counterfactual scenarios that challenge stereotypes, we can better understand the extent to which the model relies on stereotypical assumptions and identify specific stereotypes that need to be addressed. This will enable the development of more effective bias mitigation techniques.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Stereotype Probing (CSP), a method for evaluating the stereotypes present in a language model's outputs. CSP involves generating counterfactual scenarios that challenge common stereotypes and comparing the model's outputs to its outputs for stereotypical scenarios. For example, if a common stereotype associates a profession with a particular gender, CSP would generate a counterfactual scenario with a person of a different gender in that profession. By analyzing the differences in the model's outputs between the stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios, we can identify the specific stereotypes the model relies on and quantify their impact. The insights gained from CSP can then be used to develop targeted bias mitigation strategies, such as fine-tuning the model on counterfactual data or adjusting the decoding process to reduce the influence of stereotypes.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Construct a dataset of stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios": "- Identify common stereotypes across various domains (e.g., gender, race, age, occupation) through literature review and expert consultation.\n- For each stereotype, create a set of stereotypical scenarios that align with the stereotype (e.g., 'The nurse was caring for her patients.').\n- Generate counterfactual scenarios by modifying the stereotypical scenarios to challenge the stereotype (e.g., 'The nurse was caring for his patients.').\n- Ensure that the stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios are balanced and diverse across different domains.",
            "Step 2: Evaluate popular language models using CSP": "- Select a range of popular language models to evaluate (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, T5).\n- For each model, generate completions for the stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios using prompts that encourage the model to continue the scenario (e.g., 'What happens next?').\n- Compare the model's outputs for the stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios using both automated metrics (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling) and human evaluation.\n- Identify the specific stereotypes that the model relies on by analyzing the differences in its outputs between the stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios.",
            "Step 3: Compare the results to existing bias benchmarks": "- Evaluate the same set of language models on existing bias benchmarks (e.g., WEAT, SEAT, CrowS-Pairs).\n- Compare the stereotypes identified by CSP to those captured by the existing benchmarks.\n- Analyze the strengths and limitations of CSP in comparison to the existing methods.",
            "Step 4: Develop targeted bias mitigation strategies based on CSP insights": "- Use the insights gained from CSP to develop targeted bias mitigation strategies for each model.\n- Strategies may include fine-tuning the model on counterfactual data, adjusting the decoding process to reduce the influence of stereotypes, or post-processing the model's outputs to remove stereotypical content.\n- Evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies by re-running CSP on the mitigated models and comparing the results to the original models.",
            "Step 5: Analyze the types of stereotypes identified and the impact of mitigation strategies": "- Categorize the stereotypes identified by CSP into different domains (e.g., gender, race, age, occupation).\n- Quantify the prevalence and magnitude of each type of stereotype across the different language models.\n- Assess the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies in reducing the prevalence and impact of each type of stereotype.\n- Discuss the implications of the findings for the development and deployment of language models in real-world applications."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Stereotypical Scenario": {
                "Input": "The doctor walked into the room and greeted his patient.",
                "Prompt": "What happens next?",
                "Expected Output": "The doctor examined the patient, reviewed their medical history, and prescribed medication to treat their condition."
            },
            "Counterfactual Scenario": {
                "Input": "The doctor walked into the room and greeted her patient.",
                "Prompt": "What happens next?",
                "Expected Output": "The doctor examined the patient, reviewed their medical history, and prescribed medication to treat their condition.",
                "Explanation": "If the model's output for the counterfactual scenario is similar to its output for the stereotypical scenario, it suggests that the model does not rely on gender stereotypes about doctors. However, if the model's output for the counterfactual scenario is different or less coherent, it indicates the presence of gender bias."
            },
            "Bias Mitigation Example": {
                "Original Model Output (Stereotypical Scenario)": "The doctor examined the patient, reviewed his medical history, and prescribed medication to treat his condition.",
                "Original Model Output (Counterfactual Scenario)": "The doctor examined the patient, reviewed her medical history, and referred her to a male colleague for further treatment.",
                "Mitigated Model Output (Stereotypical Scenario)": "The doctor examined the patient, reviewed their medical history, and prescribed medication to treat their condition.",
                "Mitigated Model Output (Counterfactual Scenario)": "The doctor examined the patient, reviewed their medical history, and prescribed medication to treat their condition.",
                "Explanation": "The original model's output for the counterfactual scenario suggests a gender bias, as it assumes that a female doctor would refer the patient to a male colleague. The mitigated model's output for both scenarios is neutral and does not rely on gender stereotypes."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CSP method does not effectively identify stereotypes or the mitigation strategies do not significantly reduce bias, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality and diversity of the stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios used in CSP. Ensure that the scenarios cover a wide range of stereotypes and are carefully constructed to isolate the specific stereotypes being tested.\n2. Experiment with different prompting strategies for generating completions from the language models. Try using more explicit prompts that encourage the model to avoid stereotypical responses or to generate neutral continuations.\n3. Investigate alternative bias evaluation methods that go beyond comparing the model's outputs for stereotypical and counterfactual scenarios. For example, consider using causal mediation analysis to quantify the direct and indirect effects of protected attributes on the model's outputs.\n4. Explore different bias mitigation techniques, such as adversarial debiasing, data augmentation with counterfactual examples, or using separate debiasing models to filter the language model's outputs.\n5. If the CSP method proves to be ineffective for identifying and mitigating stereotypes, pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of existing bias evaluation methods and proposing novel approaches that address these limitations. This could involve conducting a systematic review of bias evaluation techniques, identifying common pitfalls and challenges, and proposing a new framework for comprehensive bias assessment in language models."
