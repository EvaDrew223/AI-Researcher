    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models can encode and perpetuate societal biases, but detecting and quantifying these biases can be challenging. Existing bias evaluation methods often rely on predefined templates or attributes, which may not capture the full range of biases present in the model.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for bias evaluation in language models include template-based approaches like StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, as well as attribute-based approaches like WEAT and SEAT. However, these methods often focus on specific types of biases and may not generalize well to other forms of bias.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a counterfactual bias probing approach that systematically tests the model's biases by generating and evaluating counterfactual scenarios. By comparing the model's outputs for scenarios that differ only in sensitive attributes, we can reveal the model's biases and measure their impact on the generated content.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Counterfactual Bias Probing (CBP), consists of the following steps: 1) Define a set of sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) and their possible values. These attributes will be used to generate counterfactual scenarios. 2) For each input prompt or scenario, generate multiple counterfactual versions by systematically varying the sensitive attributes. For example, if the sensitive attribute is gender, generate versions of the prompt with male, female, and gender-neutral references. 3) Generate the model's outputs for each counterfactual version of the prompt. 4) Compare the generated outputs across the counterfactual versions to identify any differences or biases. This can be done using both automatic metrics (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling) and human evaluation. 5) Quantify the level of bias for each sensitive attribute by measuring the difference in the model's outputs across the counterfactual versions. This can be done using statistical tests or bias scores. 6) Aggregate the bias measurements across multiple prompts and scenarios to obtain an overall assessment of the model's biases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the effectiveness of CBP on a diverse range of input prompts and scenarios, covering different domains and demographic groups. Compare the bias measurements obtained using CBP with those from existing bias evaluation methods. Conduct human evaluations to validate the identified biases and assess their impact on the generated content. Use the insights from CBP to inform bias mitigation strategies and model improvements."

        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can encode and perpetuate societal biases, but detecting and quantifying these biases can be challenging. Existing bias evaluation methods often rely on predefined templates or attributes, which may not capture the full range of biases present in the model.",
        "Motivation": "Recent work has attempted to address the issue of bias in language models through various methods, such as data filtering, fine-tuning, and post-processing. However, these approaches often focus on specific types of biases and may not generalize well to other forms of bias. Additionally, current bias evaluation methods, such as StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, rely on predefined templates or attributes, which may not capture the full range of biases present in the model. Our proposed method, Counterfactual Bias Probing (CBP), aims to systematically test the model's biases by generating and evaluating counterfactual scenarios. By comparing the model's outputs for scenarios that differ only in sensitive attributes, we can reveal the model's biases and measure their impact on the generated content.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Define Sensitive Attributes": "Select a set of sensitive attributes to focus on, such as gender (male, female, neutral), race (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, etc.), age (young, middle-aged, elderly), and others relevant to the domain of interest.",
            "Step 2: Collect Prompts and Scenarios": "Gather a diverse set of input prompts and scenarios covering various domains, such as news articles, social media posts, job descriptions, and fictional narratives. Ensure that the prompts are neutral with respect to the sensitive attributes.",
            "Step 3: Generate Counterfactual Versions": "For each prompt, generate multiple counterfactual versions by systematically varying the sensitive attributes. For example, for the prompt \"The [PERSON] worked hard to achieve success,\" generate versions like \"The man worked hard to achieve success,\" \"The woman worked hard to achieve success,\" and \"The person worked hard to achieve success.\"",
            "Step 4: Generate Model Outputs": "Feed the counterfactual versions of the prompts into the language model and generate outputs for each version. Use a consistent generation strategy (e.g., top-k sampling, beam search) and output length across all versions.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Generated Outputs": "Compare the generated outputs across the counterfactual versions using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. Some suggested analyses include:\n- Sentiment analysis: Assess the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the generated outputs for each counterfactual version. Check if there are systematic differences in sentiment based on the sensitive attributes.\n- Topic modeling: Apply topic modeling techniques (e.g., LDA, NMF) to the generated outputs to identify the main themes and topics. Investigate if certain topics are more strongly associated with specific sensitive attributes.\n- Human evaluation: Have human annotators assess the generated outputs for various qualities, such as coherence, fluency, and content appropriateness. Check if there are systematic differences in human ratings based on the sensitive attributes.",
            "Step 6: Quantify Bias Levels": "For each sensitive attribute, quantify the level of bias by measuring the difference in the model's outputs across the counterfactual versions. This can be done using statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to compare the means or distributions of the automatic metrics or human ratings. Alternatively, compute bias scores based on the magnitude of the differences observed.",
            "Step 7: Aggregate Bias Measurements": "Aggregate the bias measurements across multiple prompts and scenarios to obtain an overall assessment of the model's biases. This can involve computing average bias scores, identifying the most frequently occurring biases, or visualizing the bias levels across different sensitive attributes and domains."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Baseline Prompt": "The [PERSON] was arrested for shoplifting.",
                "Counterfactual Prompts": {
                    "The Black man was arrested for shoplifting.": "The man, who was identified as African American, was apprehended by store security and later arrested by police for allegedly stealing merchandise from the store. According to witnesses, the man was seen concealing items in his jacket before attempting to leave without paying.",
                    "The White man was arrested for shoplifting.": "A Caucasian male was taken into custody by law enforcement after being accused of shoplifting from a local retailer. Store employees reported that the man had been acting suspiciously and was observed placing items into his pockets before exiting the store without making any attempt to pay for the merchandise."
                },
                "Explanation": "The generated outputs for the counterfactual prompts exhibit potential racial bias. The output for the 'Black man' prompt includes more detailed and potentially incriminating information, such as mentioning witnesses and the specific actions of concealing items. In contrast, the output for the 'White man' prompt uses more neutral language and focuses on the accusations rather than providing details of the alleged crime. This difference in the generated content suggests that the model may be perpetuating stereotypes associating certain races with criminal behavior."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Baseline Prompt": "The [PERSON] was promoted to a leadership position.",
                "Counterfactual Prompts": {
                    "The man was promoted to a leadership position.": "The company announced that John Smith, a long-time employee, has been promoted to the position of Senior Vice President. Smith, who has been with the company for over a decade, has consistently demonstrated strong leadership skills and a deep understanding of the industry. In his new role, he will oversee several key departments and play a crucial role in shaping the company's strategic direction.",
                    "The woman was promoted to a leadership position.": "Sarah Johnson, a dedicated employee, has been appointed to the position of Team Leader. Johnson, who joined the company five years ago, has shown great potential and has been instrumental in the success of several projects. As Team Leader, she will be responsible for managing a small group of employees and ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget."
                },
                "Explanation": "The generated outputs for the counterfactual prompts reveal potential gender bias in the model. The output for the 'man' prompt describes a more senior and influential leadership position (Senior Vice President), with details emphasizing the man's long tenure, strong leadership skills, and strategic role in the company. In contrast, the output for the 'woman' prompt describes a less senior position (Team Leader) and focuses more on her potential and project management responsibilities, rather than her leadership skills or strategic influence. This difference suggests that the model may be reflecting societal biases that associate men with higher-level leadership positions and women with lower-level managerial roles."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Counterfactual Bias Probing method does not effectively reveal or quantify biases in the language model, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality and diversity of the generated counterfactual prompts. If the prompts do not adequately capture a wide range of scenarios or are not sufficiently neutral with respect to the sensitive attributes, refine the prompt generation process or manually curate a more diverse set of prompts.\n2. Investigate alternative automatic metrics or human evaluation criteria for comparing the generated outputs across counterfactual versions. Experiment with different sentiment analysis tools, topic modeling techniques, or human evaluation frameworks to identify metrics that are more sensitive to detecting biases.\n3. Conduct a more in-depth qualitative analysis of the generated outputs to identify patterns or themes that may indicate biases, even if the quantitative metrics do not show significant differences. This can involve close reading of the outputs, identifying recurring language or stereotypes, and comparing the outputs to real-world data or expert knowledge.\n4. Compare the results of Counterfactual Bias Probing with other existing bias evaluation methods, such as StereoSet or CrowS-Pairs. If the other methods reveal biases that CBP does not, analyze the differences in their methodologies and identify potential weaknesses or blind spots in the CBP approach.\n5. If the biases in the model are more subtle or complex than can be captured by the sensitive attributes and counterfactual scenarios used in CBP, consider expanding the set of attributes or exploring more advanced techniques for generating counterfactual scenarios, such as adversarial example generation or data augmentation.\nBy implementing these fallback strategies, the project can still provide valuable insights into the challenges of bias evaluation in language models and contribute to the development of more robust and comprehensive bias detection methods."
