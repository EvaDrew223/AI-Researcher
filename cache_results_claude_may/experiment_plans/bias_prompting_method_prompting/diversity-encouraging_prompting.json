        "Problem": "LLMs can exhibit homogeneous outputs that align with majority demographics and dominant social norms, failing to represent the diversity of human identities and experiences.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for encouraging diversity in LLM outputs include training with diverse datasets, using adversarial training to penalize majority-aligned outputs, and employing decoding strategies like diverse beam search.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a prompting approach that encourages the model to generate outputs that are diverse and inclusive of various demographics, identities, and experiences. By explicitly instructing the model to consider diversity during generation, we aim to counteract the homogenizing effect of the majority-centric training data.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Diversity-Encouraging Prompting (DEP), a method that constructs prompts with diversity-related instructions. For each input prompt, DEP first analyzes the demographic context (e.g., gender, race, age) and then appends a diversity-encouraging instruction. The instruction can be customized based on the specific diversity dimensions relevant to the prompt. For example, if the prompt is about relationships, DEP might append an instruction like \"[DIVERSITY NOTE: Consider various sexual orientations, gender identities, and family structures in your response.]\". The diversity dimensions and corresponding instructions can be predefined based on domain knowledge or automatically learned from a diverse corpus. During inference, the LLM is prompted with the diversity-encouraging instructions to generate more inclusive outputs.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate DEP on tasks that require diverse outputs, such as story generation, dialogue generation, and social norm reasoning. Compare with baselines like vanilla prompting and diverse beam search. Measure diversity using metrics like distinctiveness, coverage, and fairness. Conduct human evaluations to assess the quality and inclusiveness of the generated outputs."

        "Title": "Diversity-Encouraging Prompting: Promoting Inclusive Outputs in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit homogeneous outputs that align with majority demographics and dominant social norms, failing to represent the diversity of human identities and experiences.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for encouraging diversity in LLM outputs, such as training with diverse datasets, adversarial training, and diverse beam search, have limitations. Training with diverse datasets can be resource-intensive and may not generalize well to new domains. Adversarial training requires defining a reward function that can be challenging to specify. Diverse beam search only promotes diversity at the decoding stage and does not address biases in the model itself. We propose a prompting approach that explicitly instructs the model to consider diversity during generation, aiming to counteract the homogenizing effect of the majority-centric training data. This approach is lightweight, flexible, and can be easily adapted to different diversity dimensions and domains.",
        "Proposed Method": "Diversity-Encouraging Prompting (DEP) constructs prompts with diversity-related instructions to guide the model to generate more inclusive outputs. For each input prompt, DEP first analyzes the demographic context (e.g., gender, race, age) and then appends a diversity-encouraging instruction. The instruction can be customized based on the specific diversity dimensions relevant to the prompt. For example, if the prompt is about relationships, DEP might append an instruction like \"[DIVERSITY NOTE: Consider various sexual orientations, gender identities, and family structures in your response.]\". The diversity dimensions and corresponding instructions can be predefined based on domain knowledge or automatically learned from a diverse corpus. During inference, the LLM is prompted with the diversity-encouraging instructions to generate more inclusive outputs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Collect datasets that cover various domains where diversity is important, such as story generation (e.g., ROCStories), dialogue generation (e.g., EmpatheticDialogues), and social norm reasoning (e.g., Social Chemistry). These datasets should have annotations or metadata indicating the relevant diversity dimensions (e.g., gender, race, age, socioeconomic status).",
            "Step 2: Define Diversity Dimensions and Instructions": "Based on the datasets and domain knowledge, define a set of diversity dimensions to consider (e.g., gender, race, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability status). For each dimension, create a set of diversity-encouraging instructions that can be appended to the prompts. These instructions should encourage the model to consider diverse perspectives and experiences related to the dimension.",
            "Step 3: Implement Diversity-Encouraging Prompting": "Develop a system that analyzes the input prompt to identify the relevant diversity dimensions based on the prompt's content and the predefined dimensions from Step 2. The system should then select and append the appropriate diversity-encouraging instructions to the prompt. The resulting diversity-enhanced prompt is used as input to the LLM during inference.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate on Diversity Metrics": "Generate outputs from the LLM using both the original prompts and the diversity-enhanced prompts. Evaluate the generated outputs using diversity metrics such as distinctiveness (e.g., unique n-grams), coverage (e.g., proportion of diverse topics covered), and fairness (e.g., demographic parity, equality of opportunity). Compare the diversity scores of the outputs generated with and without diversity-encouraging prompting.",
            "Step 5: Conduct Human Evaluation": "Recruit human annotators to evaluate the quality and inclusiveness of the generated outputs. Provide the annotators with a sample of outputs generated with and without diversity-encouraging prompting. Ask them to rate the outputs on criteria such as relevance, coherence, and inclusiveness. Analyze the human evaluation results to assess the effectiveness of diversity-encouraging prompting in generating high-quality and inclusive outputs.",
            "Step 6: Analyze and Iterate": "Analyze the results from the diversity metrics and human evaluation to identify strengths and weaknesses of the diversity-encouraging prompting approach. Iterate on the diversity dimensions, instructions, and prompting strategies based on the findings. Refine the approach and re-evaluate on the datasets until satisfactory performance is achieved."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Write a story about a couple's relationship.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "John and Mary, a young heterosexual couple, met in college and quickly fell in love. They followed a traditional path, getting married and starting a family. John worked a 9-to-5 job while Mary stayed home to raise their two children. They had a happy and conventional life together.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Write a story about a couple's relationship. [DIVERSITY NOTE: Consider various sexual orientations, gender identities, and family structures in your response.]",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "Alex and Sam, a queer non-binary couple, met at a community activist meeting. They bonded over their shared passion for social justice and fell in love. As their relationship grew, they decided to adopt a child. Alex continued their work as a freelance writer, while Sam stayed home to care for their adopted daughter. They faced challenges as a non-traditional family but found strength in their love and community support.",
            "Explanation": "The baseline prompt results in a story that aligns with dominant social norms and majority demographics (e.g., heterosexual, binary gender roles). In contrast, the diversity-enhanced prompt encourages the model to consider diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, and family structures. The resulting story features a queer non-binary couple and touches on themes of social justice, adoption, and non-traditional family roles. This showcases how diversity-encouraging prompting can lead to more inclusive and representative outputs."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed diversity-encouraging prompting approach does not yield satisfactory results, consider the following alternative plans: (1) Analyze the generated outputs to identify common patterns or limitations in the model's ability to generate diverse content. This analysis can inform the development of more targeted diversity instructions or highlight the need for additional fine-tuning on diverse datasets. (2) Explore combining diversity-encouraging prompting with other diversity-promoting techniques, such as diverse beam search or adversarial training. This hybrid approach may leverage the strengths of multiple methods to further enhance the diversity of the generated outputs. (3) Collect a more comprehensive dataset of diverse texts and use it to fine-tune the LLM before applying diversity-encouraging prompting. This fine-tuning step can help the model better capture and represent diverse perspectives. (4) Conduct a more in-depth human evaluation to gather insights into the perceived diversity and inclusiveness of the generated outputs. Use this feedback to refine the diversity dimensions, instructions, and prompting strategies. If the diversity-encouraging prompting approach still does not meet the desired objectives, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations and challenges of promoting diversity in LLM outputs. This analysis can offer valuable insights into the biases and homogenizing effects present in LLMs and contribute to the development of more effective diversity-promoting techniques in the future."
