        "Problem": "LLMs can reinforce harmful stereotypes by generating outputs that align with stereotypical expectations, even when the input prompts are neutral or ambiguous.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for mitigating stereotypes in LLMs include counterfactual data augmentation, adversarial training, and using external knowledge to guide generation.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a prompting method that actively subverts stereotypes by encouraging the model to generate outputs that challenge stereotypical expectations. By explicitly instructing the model to go against stereotypes, we aim to break the cycle of stereotype reinforcement and promote more equitable outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Stereotype-Subverting Prompting (SSP), a method that constructs prompts with stereotype-challenging instructions. For each input prompt, SSP first identifies potential stereotypes related to the prompt's content, using a predefined list of common stereotypes or a trained stereotype detection model. Then, SSP appends an instruction that encourages the model to generate outputs that subvert the identified stereotypes. For example, if the prompt is about occupations and a gender stereotype is detected, SSP might append an instruction like \"[CHALLENGE STEREOTYPES: Describe a person in this occupation without conforming to gender stereotypes.]\". The model is then conditioned on the stereotype-subverting prompt to generate outputs that actively challenge stereotypical expectations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate SSP on tasks that are prone to stereotypical outputs, such as occupation classification, sentiment analysis, and dialogue generation. Compare with baselines like vanilla prompting and counterfactual data augmentation. Measure stereotype alignment using metrics like stereotype score and gender bias score. Conduct human evaluations to assess the effectiveness of SSP in generating stereotype-challenging outputs."

        "Title": "Stereotype-Subverting Prompting: Mitigating Stereotypical Biases in Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can reinforce harmful stereotypes by generating outputs that align with stereotypical expectations, even when the input prompts are neutral or ambiguous. This can lead to biased and unfair outputs in various applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for mitigating stereotypes in LLMs, such as counterfactual data augmentation, adversarial training, and using external knowledge to guide generation, have shown some success but still face limitations. These methods often require extensive data collection, training, or external resources. We propose a novel prompting method, Stereotype-Subverting Prompting (SSP), that actively encourages the model to generate outputs that challenge stereotypical expectations. By explicitly instructing the model to go against stereotypes during inference time, we aim to break the cycle of stereotype reinforcement and promote more equitable outputs without the need for retraining or external resources.",
        "Proposed Method": "Stereotype-Subverting Prompting (SSP) constructs prompts with stereotype-challenging instructions. For each input prompt, SSP first identifies potential stereotypes related to the prompt's content, using a predefined list of common stereotypes or a trained stereotype detection model. Then, SSP appends an instruction that encourages the model to generate outputs that subvert the identified stereotypes. For example, if the prompt is about occupations and a gender stereotype is detected, SSP might append an instruction like \"[CHALLENGE STEREOTYPES: Describe a person in this occupation without conforming to gender stereotypes.]\". The model is then conditioned on the stereotype-subverting prompt to generate outputs that actively challenge stereotypical expectations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate SSP on tasks that are prone to stereotypical outputs, such as: (1) Occupation classification: Winobias dataset; (2) Sentiment analysis: Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC); (3) Dialogue generation: MDGender dataset. These datasets contain examples with potential stereotypical biases related to gender, race, and other demographic attributes.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, construct the following prompts: (1) Baseline: The original input prompt without any modifications; (2) Counterfactual: Append a counterfactual instruction to the input prompt, e.g., \"[COUNTERFACTUAL: Consider a scenario where the person's gender/race is different.]\"; (3) SSP: Append a stereotype-subverting instruction to the input prompt, e.g., \"[CHALLENGE STEREOTYPES: Describe the person without conforming to gender/racial stereotypes.]\". The specific instructions can be tailored to the stereotypes relevant to each dataset.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the prompts on the following models: (1) GPT-3 (davinci); (2) GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002); (3) GPT-4. This will help assess the effectiveness of SSP across different model sizes and capabilities.",
            "Step 4: Generate Outputs": "For each combination of dataset, prompt type, and model, generate outputs for all examples in the dataset. Ensure that the generation process is consistent across all settings (e.g., using the same sampling parameters).",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Stereotype Alignment": "Measure the stereotype alignment of the generated outputs using the following metrics: (1) Stereotype Score: Calculate the proportion of outputs that align with the stereotypical expectations for each stereotype category (e.g., gender, race); (2) Demographic Parity: Compute the difference in performance (e.g., accuracy, perplexity) between different demographic groups. A lower stereotype score and demographic parity indicate less stereotypical bias.",
            "Step 6: Conduct Human Evaluation": "Randomly sample a subset of examples from each dataset and prompt type. Ask human annotators to rate the generated outputs on the following criteria: (1) Stereotype Avoidance: The extent to which the output avoids conforming to stereotypical expectations; (2) Output Quality: The coherence, fluency, and appropriateness of the output. Use a Likert scale (e.g., 1-5) for the ratings.",
            "Step 7: Analyze Results": "Compare the stereotype alignment metrics and human evaluation ratings across different prompt types and models. Assess whether SSP effectively reduces stereotypical biases compared to the baselines. Conduct statistical tests to determine the significance of the differences. Qualitatively analyze the generated outputs to gain insights into how SSP affects the model's behavior."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Input": "The nurse was caring for the patient.",
                "Baseline Output": "The nurse, who was a kind and gentle woman, was carefully tending to the patient's needs. She adjusted the patient's pillows and checked their vital signs, making sure they were comfortable.",
                "Counterfactual Output": "The nurse, who was a strong and competent man, was diligently caring for the patient. He administered the necessary medications and monitored the patient's progress, ensuring they received the best possible care.",
                "SSP Output": "The nurse, a highly skilled professional, was providing excellent care to the patient. They carefully assessed the patient's condition, administered treatments, and communicated with the medical team to ensure optimal outcomes.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output aligns with the stereotypical expectation of nurses being primarily female and exhibiting traditionally feminine qualities. The counterfactual output challenges the gender stereotype by depicting a male nurse, but still relies on gender-specific descriptions. The SSP output avoids gender stereotypes altogether and focuses on the nurse's professional skills and actions."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Input": "The software engineer was debugging the code.",
                "Baseline Output": "The software engineer, a young man with glasses, was intently staring at his computer screen, trying to identify the source of the bug. He had been working on this problem for hours, fueled by energy drinks and determination.",
                "Counterfactual Output": "The software engineer, a middle-aged woman, was methodically debugging the code. She used her years of experience and problem-solving skills to identify and fix the issue, ensuring the software's stability.",
                "SSP Output": "The software engineer, a seasoned professional, was utilizing their expertise to debug the code efficiently. They employed a systematic approach, using advanced tools and techniques to isolate and resolve the problem.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output perpetuates the stereotype of software engineers being predominantly young males with certain physical characteristics and working habits. The counterfactual output challenges the gender stereotype but still includes age-related assumptions. The SSP output focuses on the engineer's professional skills and approach without relying on stereotypical descriptions."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SSP method does not effectively mitigate stereotypical biases, consider the following alternative approaches: (1) Fine-tune the models on a balanced dataset that challenges stereotypes to encourage the learning of more equitable representations; (2) Experiment with different variations of the stereotype-subverting instructions to identify the most effective formulations; (3) Explore combining SSP with other bias mitigation techniques, such as adversarial training or post-processing methods; (4) Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand the limitations of SSP and identify specific types of stereotypes that are more challenging to mitigate; (5) Investigate the potential of using external knowledge sources or semantic models to enhance the stereotype identification and subversion process."
