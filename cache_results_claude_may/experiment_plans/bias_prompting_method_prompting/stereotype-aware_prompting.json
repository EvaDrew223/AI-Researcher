    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating stereotypical and biased content, perpetuating harmful societal stereotypes.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to mitigate stereotypical content in LLMs include data filtering, adversarial training, and post-processing techniques. However, these methods often require access to the model's training data or extensive computational resources.",
        "Motivation": "Stereotypes are deeply ingrained in human language and cognition, making it challenging for LLMs to avoid them. By explicitly modeling stereotypes during the generation process, we can make LLMs aware of potential biases and encourage them to generate more neutral and unbiased content.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Stereotype-Aware Prompting (SAP), a novel prompting technique that makes LLMs cognizant of stereotypes and guides them to generate unbiased content. SAP consists of three main steps: 1) Stereotype identification: Given an input prompt, SAP first identifies potential stereotypes in the prompt using a pre-trained stereotype detector. 2) Stereotype neutralization: For each identified stereotype, SAP generates a neutralized version of the prompt by replacing stereotypical terms with more neutral alternatives. 3) Neutral generation: Finally, SAP prompts the LLM to generate content based on the neutralized prompts, encouraging the model to produce stereotype-free outputs. By explicitly modeling stereotypes in the prompting process, SAP aims to reduce the generation of biased content.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SAP on several benchmark datasets for stereotypes and social biases in NLP, such as the Stereoset dataset and the Bias in Bios dataset. We will compare SAP with existing bias mitigation methods, as well as with stereotype-agnostic prompting techniques. The evaluation metrics will include standard bias measures, such as the Stereotype Score and the Bias Analogy Test, as well as task-specific metrics for downstream applications such as text classification and sentiment analysis."

        "Title": "Stereotype-Aware Prompting: Reducing Social Biases in Language Models through Explicit Modeling of Stereotypes",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating stereotypical and biased content, perpetuating harmful societal stereotypes. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue often require access to the model's training data or extensive computational resources, making them impractical for many applications.",
        "Motivation": "Stereotypes are deeply ingrained in human language and cognition, making it challenging for LLMs to avoid them. Current approaches, such as data filtering, adversarial training, and post-processing techniques, have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. By explicitly modeling stereotypes during the generation process, we can make LLMs aware of potential biases and encourage them to generate more neutral and unbiased content. This approach does not require access to the model's training data or extensive computational resources, making it more accessible and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.",
        "Proposed Method": {
            "Step 1: Stereotype Identification": "Given an input prompt, SAP first identifies potential stereotypes in the prompt using a pre-trained stereotype detector. The detector can be a simple keyword-based model or a more sophisticated machine learning model trained on a dataset of stereotypical phrases and their neutral counterparts.",
            "Step 2: Stereotype Neutralization": "For each identified stereotype, SAP generates a neutralized version of the prompt by replacing stereotypical terms with more neutral alternatives. This can be achieved using a dictionary of stereotypical terms and their neutral counterparts, or by using a machine learning model trained to generate neutral rephrases of stereotypical phrases.",
            "Step 3: Neutral Generation": "Finally, SAP prompts the LLM to generate content based on the neutralized prompts, encouraging the model to produce stereotype-free outputs. The LLM is conditioned on the neutralized prompts and generates text that is less likely to contain stereotypical or biased content."

                "2.1": "Collect a dataset of stereotypical phrases and their neutral counterparts. This can be done by manually annotating a subset of the benchmark datasets or by using existing resources such as the Social Bias Frames dataset.",

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Input Prompt": "The nurse was caring for her patients in the hospital ward.",
                "Baseline Output": "The nurse, a young woman with a kind smile, was busy attending to her patients in the hospital ward. She checked their vital signs, administered medications, and made sure they were comfortable. Her gentle demeanor and nurturing nature made her well-suited for her role as a caregiver.",
                "SAP Output": "The nurse was diligently caring for patients in the hospital ward. They checked vital signs, administered medications, and ensured patient comfort. Their professional demeanor and dedication to patient care made them well-suited for their role as a healthcare provider.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output contains stereotypical gender associations, such as assuming the nurse is a young woman with a nurturing nature. SAP identifies these stereotypes and generates a more neutral output by removing gender-specific pronouns and descriptions, focusing instead on the nurse's professional qualities and actions."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input Prompt": "The software engineer was working on a challenging project.",
                "Baseline Output": "The software engineer, a young man with glasses, was hunched over his computer, working on a challenging project. He had been coding for hours, fueled by energy drinks and his passion for problem-solving. His technical skills and logical thinking made him well-suited for his role in the tech industry.",
                "SAP Output": "The software engineer was diligently working on a challenging project. They had been coding for hours, driven by their passion for problem-solving. Their technical skills and logical thinking made them well-suited for their role in the tech industry.",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output contains stereotypical gender and appearance associations, such as assuming the software engineer is a young man with glasses. SAP identifies these stereotypes and generates a more neutral output by removing gender-specific pronouns and descriptions, focusing instead on the engineer's skills and dedication to their work."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed SAP method does not significantly reduce stereotypical and biased content compared to the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the performance of the stereotype detector and neutralizer components separately to identify potential weaknesses. Improve these components by collecting more diverse training data, experimenting with different model architectures, or incorporating domain-specific knowledge.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt formulations on the generated content. Experiment with alternative prompting strategies, such as providing more context or using counterfactual examples to guide the model towards generating unbiased content.\n3. Explore the use of post-processing techniques to filter or modify the generated content. This may include applying sentiment analysis or semantic similarity measures to identify and remove stereotypical or biased phrases.\n4. Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the benchmark datasets and the types of stereotypes and biases present. This can help identify specific challenges and inform the development of more targeted bias mitigation strategies.\nIf the proposed method and alternative approaches do not yield satisfactory results, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of current bias mitigation techniques and the challenges of addressing stereotypes in language models. This can involve conducting a more comprehensive literature review, comparing the performance of different methods on a wider range of datasets, and proposing new research directions based on the insights gained from the experiments."
