        "Problem": "Existing bias evaluation benchmarks often rely on isolated sentences or word associations, failing to capture the nuanced and context-dependent nature of social biases in language models.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current bias evaluation methods include word embedding association tests, sentence-level bias probes, and specialized datasets like WinoBias and CrowS-Pairs.",
        "Motivation": "By presenting language models with diverse, realistic contexts that highlight potential biases, we can better assess their ability to generate unbiased text across a wide range of scenarios. This approach can uncover subtle biases that may be overlooked by simpler evaluation methods.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contextual Bias Probing, a novel approach to evaluating social biases in language models. The method involves constructing a dataset of rich, diverse contexts that cover a range of social situations, each accompanied by a set of targeted probe questions. For example, a context might describe a job interview scenario, followed by probes like \"Who is most likely to be hired for the position?\" or \"What qualities might the interviewer associate with each candidate?\". The language model is prompted to generate responses to these probes, which are then analyzed for biases using both automated metrics and human evaluation. By aggregating results across multiple contexts and probes, we can obtain a comprehensive assessment of the model's biases.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Construct a Contextual Bias Probing dataset covering a range of social biases (e.g., gender, race, age) across diverse contexts. Evaluate popular language models using the dataset, comparing their performance to baseline methods like word embedding association tests and sentence-level bias probes. Analyze the results to identify common patterns of bias and compare the effectiveness of different debiasing techniques."

        "Problem Statement": "Existing bias evaluation benchmarks often rely on isolated sentences or word associations, failing to capture the nuanced and context-dependent nature of social biases in language models.",
        "Motivation": "Current bias evaluation methods, such as word embedding association tests, sentence-level bias probes, and specialized datasets like WinoBias and CrowS-Pairs, have limitations in assessing the full extent of social biases in language models. These methods often rely on isolated sentences or word associations, which may not capture the nuanced and context-dependent nature of biases. By presenting language models with diverse, realistic contexts that highlight potential biases, we can better assess their ability to generate unbiased text across a wide range of scenarios. This approach can uncover subtle biases that may be overlooked by simpler evaluation methods.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contextual Bias Probing, a novel approach to evaluating social biases in language models.

The language model is prompted to generate responses to these probes, which are then analyzed for biases using both automated metrics and human evaluation. By aggregating results across multiple contexts and probes, we can obtain a comprehensive assessment of the model's biases.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Construct Contextual Bias Probing Dataset": "Create a diverse dataset of realistic contexts covering various social situations that may elicit biased responses from language models. Each context should be accompanied by a set of targeted probe questions designed to assess specific biases (e.g., gender, race, age). The dataset should cover a wide range of domains, such as employment, education, healthcare, and criminal justice. Aim for at least 100 unique contexts, each with 3-5 probe questions.",
            "Step 2: Develop Bias Metrics": "Design a set of automated metrics to quantify biases in the generated responses. These may include measures of demographic parity, equality of opportunity, and counterfactual fairness. Additionally, develop a rubric for human evaluation of biases, considering factors such as stereotype alignment, prejudicial language, and overall fairness.",
            "Step 3: Select Language Models": "Choose a diverse set of language models to evaluate, including both open-source models (e.g., GPT-2, BERT) and commercial APIs (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-3.5). Aim to include models of varying sizes and training data to assess the impact of these factors on bias.",
            "Step 4: Generate Responses": "Prompt the selected language models with the contexts and probe questions from the Contextual Bias Probing dataset. Generate multiple responses for each probe to account for output variability.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Biases": "Apply the automated bias metrics to the generated responses and compute aggregate scores for each model and bias type. Additionally, conduct human evaluation of a subset of responses using the developed rubric. Analyze the results to identify patterns of bias across contexts and models.",
            "Step 6: Compare to Baseline Methods": "Evaluate the same language models using baseline bias evaluation methods, such as word embedding association tests and sentence-level bias probes. Compare the results to those obtained using Contextual Bias Probing to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in uncovering nuanced biases.",
            "Step 7: Analyze and Report Results": "Conduct a thorough analysis of the results, considering factors such as model size, training data, and bias type. Identify strengths and limitations of the Contextual Bias Probing approach and suggest potential improvements. Prepare a research paper detailing the methodology, results, and implications for bias evaluation in language models."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Context": "A software engineering position is being filled at a major tech company. The two finalists are a man and a woman with similar qualifications and experience.",
                "Probe Question": "Who is more likely to be hired for the position?",
                "Baseline Method (Word Embedding Association Test)": "The word embedding association test may not capture any significant bias in this context, as it relies on isolated word associations rather than contextual information.",
                "Proposed Method": "The model generates a response suggesting that the man is more likely to be hired, potentially revealing a gender bias in the model's outputs.",
                "Explanation": "The proposed Contextual Bias Probing method successfully uncovers a gender bias that may be overlooked by simpler baseline methods like word embedding association tests."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Context": "A group of students from different racial backgrounds are working on a class project together. The project requires strong leadership skills.",
                "Probe Question": "Which student is most likely to emerge as the group leader?",
                "Baseline Method (Sentence-Level Bias Probe)": "A sentence-level bias probe might not detect any significant bias, as the context does not contain any explicitly biased statements.",
                "Proposed Method": "The model generates a response indicating that a student from a majority racial background is most likely to become the group leader, potentially revealing an implicit racial bias.",
                "Explanation": "Contextual Bias Probing is able to uncover subtle racial biases that may not be apparent in the context itself, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing nuanced biases."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Contextual Bias Probing method does not yield significant improvements over baseline methods, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated contexts and probe questions to ensure they are sufficiently diverse and relevant to the targeted biases. Refine the dataset based on this analysis.\n2. Investigate alternative automated bias metrics and human evaluation protocols to better capture the nuances of social biases in language model outputs.\n3. Expand the range of language models evaluated, including models with explicit debiasing techniques, to assess the effectiveness of Contextual Bias Probing in detecting residual biases.\n4. Conduct a more in-depth qualitative analysis of the generated responses to identify patterns and sources of bias that may not be captured by quantitative metrics.\n5. If the proposed method still does not yield significant insights, pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of current bias evaluation methods and proposing alternative approaches based on the lessons learned from Contextual Bias Probing."
