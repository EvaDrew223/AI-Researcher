        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide granular and interpretable uncertainty estimates that distinguish between different sources or levels of uncertainty, such as data uncertainty, model uncertainty, and task-specific uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for hierarchical uncertainty estimation in deep learning models include Bayesian hierarchical models, deep ensembles with different architectures, and probabilistic circuits. However, these methods are often computationally expensive and may not be directly applicable to prompting-based approaches.",
        "Motivation": "By designing prompts that elicit uncertainty estimates at different levels of granularity and abstraction, we can encourage LLMs to provide more interpretable and actionable uncertainty scores. Hierarchical prompting can also help to disentangle different sources of uncertainty and identify specific areas for improvement.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Hierarchical Uncertainty Prompting (HUP), a prompting method that elicits uncertainty estimates at multiple levels of granularity and abstraction. The key steps are: 1) Given an input query, generate a hierarchical set of subprompts that probe uncertainties at different levels (e.g., data-level, model-level, task-level). 2) For each subprompt, generate a set of clarification questions or assumptions to further probe the model's uncertainty (e.g., \"What additional information would help to reduce uncertainty in this aspect?\"). 3) Prompt the model to generate responses and uncertainty estimates for each subprompt and clarification question. 4) Aggregate the uncertainty estimates hierarchically to obtain calibrated scores at each level of abstraction. 5) Use the hierarchical uncertainty scores to identify specific areas for improvement or clarification.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate HUP on benchmark datasets for tasks that involve multiple levels of uncertainty, such as open-domain QA, multi-hop reasoning, and task-oriented dialogue. Compare against flat prompting baselines and hierarchical Bayesian models. Metrics include level-specific calibration errors, interpretability scores, and task performance at different uncertainty thresholds."

        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide granular and interpretable uncertainty estimates that distinguish between different sources or levels of uncertainty, such as data uncertainty, model uncertainty, and task-specific uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for hierarchical uncertainty estimation in deep learning models, such as Bayesian hierarchical models, deep ensembles with different architectures, and probabilistic circuits, are often computationally expensive and may not be directly applicable to prompting-based approaches.

        "Proposed Method": "We propose Hierarchical Uncertainty Prompting (HUP), a prompting method that elicits uncertainty estimates at multiple levels of granularity and abstraction. The key steps are:\n1. Given an input query, generate a hierarchical set of subprompts that probe uncertainties at different levels (e.g., data-level, model-level, task-level).\n2. For each subprompt, generate a set of clarification questions or assumptions to further probe the model's uncertainty (e.g., \"What additional information would help to reduce uncertainty in this aspect?\").\n3. Prompt the model to generate responses and uncertainty estimates for each subprompt and clarification question.\n4. Aggregate the uncertainty estimates hierarchically to obtain calibrated scores at each level of abstraction.\n5. Use the hierarchical uncertainty scores to identify specific areas for improvement or clarification.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate HUP on benchmark datasets for tasks that involve multiple levels of uncertainty, such as open-domain QA (Natural Questions, TriviaQA), multi-hop reasoning (HotpotQA, QAngaroo), and task-oriented dialogue (MultiWOZ, SGD). These datasets cover a range of uncertainty sources, including data ambiguity, knowledge gaps, and task complexity.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Baseline prompts: (a) Direct prompting: Ask the question directly without any additional instructions. (b) Confidence prompting: Append \"How confident are you in your answer?\" to the question.\n2. HUP prompts: (a) Subprompt generation: Provide examples of how to break down a question into subprompts at different levels (e.g., \"What is the main source of uncertainty in answering this question: (1) Incomplete data, (2) Ambiguous question, or (3) Complex reasoning required?\"). (b) Clarification question generation: Provide examples of how to generate clarification questions for each subprompt (e.g., \"What additional information would help to reduce uncertainty due to incomplete data?\"). (c) Response generation: Prompt the model to generate answers and uncertainty estimates for each subprompt and clarification question.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate HUP on GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and open-source models like BLOOM and LLaMA. Compare the performance of different models in generating granular and interpretable uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "1. Generate model responses and uncertainty estimates using the baseline and HUP prompts for each dataset.\n2. Aggregate the uncertainty estimates hierarchically for HUP.\n3. Compute evaluation metrics: (a) Calibration error at each level of the hierarchy, (b) Interpretability scores based on human evaluation of the generated uncertainty explanations, and (c) Task performance at different uncertainty thresholds.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "1. Compare the calibration errors and interpretability scores of HUP against the baseline methods. Assess whether HUP provides more granular and interpretable uncertainty estimates.\n2. Analyze the impact of using different uncertainty thresholds on task performance. Determine if HUP can effectively identify and filter out uncertain predictions.\n3. Conduct error analysis to identify common patterns or sources of uncertainty that are not well-captured by HUP."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "Paris",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Confidence Prompting)": "What is the capital of France? How confident are you in your answer?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Confidence Prompting)": "Paris. I am very confident in my answer.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (HUP Subprompt Generation)": "What is the capital of France?\nBreak down the question into subprompts that probe uncertainties at different levels:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (HUP Subprompt Generation)": "1. Data-level: Is there any ambiguity or incompleteness in the question that could lead to uncertainty?\n2. Model-level: How confident am I in my knowledge about the capital of France?\n3. Task-level: Is this a straightforward factoid question or does it require complex reasoning?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (HUP Clarification Question Generation)": "For each subprompt, generate a clarification question that could help reduce uncertainty:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (HUP Clarification Question Generation)": "1. Data-level: Is there any additional context or time period specified for the capital of France?\n2. Model-level: What is the source of my knowledge about the capital of France and how reliable is it?\n3. Task-level: Is there any hidden complexity or ambiguity in the question that requires further clarification?",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (HUP Response Generation)": "Generate responses and uncertainty estimates for each subprompt and clarification question:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (HUP Response Generation)": "1. Data-level:\n- Subprompt: No ambiguity or incompleteness detected in the question. Uncertainty: Low\n- Clarification: No additional context or time period specified. Uncertainty: Low\n2. Model-level:\n- Subprompt: I am highly confident in my knowledge that Paris is the capital of France. Uncertainty: Low\n- Clarification: My knowledge comes from reliable sources such as encyclopedias and geography textbooks. Uncertainty: Low\n3. Task-level:\n- Subprompt: This is a straightforward factoid question that does not require complex reasoning. Uncertainty: Low\n- Clarification: No hidden complexity or ambiguity detected in the question. Uncertainty: Low\nFinal Answer: Paris\nAggregate Uncertainty: Low",
            "Explanation": "The proposed HUP method generates granular uncertainty estimates at multiple levels (data, model, task) and provides interpretable explanations for the sources of uncertainty. In this test case, HUP identifies that there is low uncertainty across all levels, leading to a high-confidence prediction. In contrast, the baseline methods only provide a single, coarse-grained uncertainty estimate."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed HUP method does not outperform the baselines in terms of calibration error or interpretability scores, consider the following fallback plans:\n1. Analyze the generated subprompts and clarification questions to identify potential issues, such as irrelevant or redundant questions. Refine the prompts to generate more targeted and informative questions.\n2. Experiment with different uncertainty aggregation methods, such as weighted averaging or probabilistic models, to better combine the uncertainty estimates from different levels.\n3. Collect human annotations for the sources and levels of uncertainty in a subset of the test examples. Use these annotations to fine-tune the prompts and improve the generation of subprompts and clarification questions.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify the limitations of HUP and potential areas for improvement. Focus on cases where HUP performs poorly compared to the baselines and try to understand the underlying reasons.\n5. If HUP consistently underperforms the baselines, consider simplifying the approach by reducing the number of hierarchical levels or using a different uncertainty estimation method, such as Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods.\n6. If the proposed method fails to provide meaningful insights or improvements, pivot the project to an analysis of the challenges and limitations of eliciting granular uncertainty estimates from LLMs using prompting methods. Discuss potential alternative approaches and future research directions."
