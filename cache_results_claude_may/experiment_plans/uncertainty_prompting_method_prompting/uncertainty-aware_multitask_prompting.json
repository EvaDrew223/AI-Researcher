        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their own uncertainty across diverse tasks, leading to overconfident predictions even when they are incorrect.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for uncertainty estimation in LLMs include using model ensembles, dropout-based methods, or post-hoc calibration techniques. However, these methods often require additional computational overhead or fail to generalize well across different tasks.",
        "Motivation": "We hypothesize that exposing LLMs to a diverse set of tasks during the prompting phase can help them better understand the inherent uncertainty associated with each task. By jointly learning to solve multiple tasks and estimate uncertainty, the model can develop a more robust and task-agnostic understanding of its own limitations.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Multitask Prompting (UAMP), a novel prompting approach that trains LLMs to simultaneously solve multiple tasks and estimate their uncertainty. During prompting, we provide the model with a set of diverse tasks, each accompanied by an uncertainty estimation objective. The model is prompted to generate not only the task output but also an uncertainty score for each prediction. The uncertainty scores are compared against the model's accuracy on each task, and the model is encouraged to minimize the discrepancy between its predicted uncertainty and actual performance. By exposing the model to a wide range of tasks and explicitly optimizing for uncertainty estimation, UAMP enables LLMs to develop a more calibrated understanding of their own limitations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UAMP on a diverse set of NLP tasks, including question answering, natural language inference, and text classification. We will compare the uncertainty estimation performance of UAMP against baseline methods such as model ensembles and post-hoc calibration techniques. Evaluation metrics will include expected calibration error (ECE), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and Brier score. We will also analyze the model's performance across different task domains to assess the generalizability of the learned uncertainty estimates."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Aware Multitask Prompting for Improved Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their own uncertainty across diverse tasks, leading to overconfident predictions even when they are incorrect. This can limit their reliability and trustworthiness in real-world applications where well-calibrated confidence estimates are crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for uncertainty estimation in LLMs, such as model ensembles, dropout-based methods, or post-hoc calibration techniques, often require additional computational overhead or fail to generalize well across different tasks. We hypothesize that exposing LLMs to a diverse set of tasks during the prompting phase can help them better understand the inherent uncertainty associated with each task. By jointly learning to solve multiple tasks and estimate uncertainty, the model can develop a more robust and task-agnostic understanding of its own limitations.",

By exposing the model to a wide range of tasks and explicitly optimizing for uncertainty estimation, UAMP enables LLMs to develop a more calibrated understanding of their own limitations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate UAMP on a diverse set of NLP tasks, including question answering (SQuAD, TriviaQA), natural language inference (MNLI, SNLI), and text classification (AG News, DBpedia). These datasets cover a range of task difficulties and domains to assess the generalizability of UAMP.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each task, we will create prompts that include both the task-specific input and an uncertainty estimation objective. The prompt will be structured as follows:\n\nTask: [Task Description]\nInput: [Task-specific Input]\nOutput: [Model's Prediction]\nUncertainty: [Model's Uncertainty Estimate]\n\nFor example, for question answering:\n\nTask: Answer the following question based on the provided context.\nInput: Context: [Context Text] Question: [Question Text]\nOutput: [Model's Answer]\nUncertainty: [Model's Uncertainty Estimate]\n\nWe will create multiple prompts for each task to cover a diverse set of examples.",
            "Step 3: Define Uncertainty Estimation Objective": "We will define an uncertainty estimation objective that encourages the model to minimize the discrepancy between its predicted uncertainty and actual performance. One possible objective is the Brier score, which measures the mean squared error between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. The uncertainty scores generated by the model will be compared against the model's accuracy on each task using this objective.",
            "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "We will experiment with different prompt engineering techniques to optimize the uncertainty estimation performance. This may include varying the prompt structure, using different uncertainty estimation objectives, or incorporating task-specific instructions or examples.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection and Training": "We will use pre-trained large language models such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 for our experiments. We will fine-tune these models on the constructed prompts using the uncertainty estimation objective. The models will be trained to jointly solve the tasks and estimate their uncertainty.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the trained models on held-out test sets for each task. We will compare the uncertainty estimation performance of UAMP against baseline methods such as model ensembles, dropout-based methods, and post-hoc calibration techniques. Evaluation metrics will include expected calibration error (ECE), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and Brier score. We will also analyze the model's performance across different task domains to assess the generalizability of the learned uncertainty estimates.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "We will conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of UAMP. This may include removing the uncertainty estimation objective, varying the number and diversity of tasks, or comparing different prompt engineering techniques. These studies will provide insights into the key factors contributing to the effectiveness of UAMP.",
            "Step 8: Error Analysis": "We will perform error analysis to identify common patterns or challenges in uncertainty estimation. This may involve analyzing cases where the model is overconfident or underconfident, examining the relationship between task difficulty and uncertainty estimates, or investigating the impact of domain shift on uncertainty calibration."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Context: The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Question: In which city is the Eiffel Tower located?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAMP)": "Task: Answer the following question based on the provided context and estimate your uncertainty in the answer.\nInput: Context: The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Question: In which city is the Eiffel Tower located?\nOutput: The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.\nUncertainty: 0.05",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAMP)": "Output: The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.\nUncertainty: 0.05",
            "Explanation": "In this example, the model correctly answers the question and provides a low uncertainty estimate, indicating high confidence in its prediction. The proposed UAMP method allows the model to jointly solve the task and estimate its uncertainty, leading to a well-calibrated prediction.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAMP) - Challenging Example": "Task: Answer the following question based on the provided context and estimate your uncertainty in the answer.\nInput: Context: The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a freestanding bell tower located in the city of Pisa, Italy. It is known worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an unstable foundation. Question: What is the height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa?\nOutput: The Leaning Tower of Pisa is approximately 56 meters tall.\nUncertainty: 0.4",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAMP) - Challenging Example": "Output: The Leaning Tower of Pisa is approximately 56 meters tall.\nUncertainty: 0.4",
            "Explanation - Challenging Example": "In this example, the model attempts to answer the question but expresses higher uncertainty in its prediction. The context does not provide the exact height of the tower, so the model makes an approximate guess and assigns a higher uncertainty score. The UAMP method allows the model to communicate its uncertainty when facing challenging or ambiguous questions."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UAMP method does not significantly improve uncertainty estimation compared to the baselines, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n\n1. Analyze the generated uncertainty scores to understand if they are meaningful and well-calibrated. If the scores are not informative, we can explore different uncertainty estimation objectives or techniques to improve their quality.\n\n2. Investigate the impact of task diversity on uncertainty estimation. If the model struggles to generalize across different tasks, we can consider increasing the diversity of tasks during prompting or incorporating task-specific adaptation techniques.\n\n3. Examine the relationship between model size and uncertainty estimation. If larger models exhibit better uncertainty calibration, we can explore techniques to efficiently scale up the model size while maintaining computational feasibility.\n\n4. Conduct a thorough error analysis to identify common patterns or challenges in uncertainty estimation. This can inform the development of targeted techniques to address specific issues, such as handling out-of-distribution examples or improving calibration on difficult tasks.\n\n5. Explore alternative approaches for uncertainty estimation, such as Bayesian methods or ensemble-based techniques, and compare their performance against UAMP. This can provide insights into the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty estimation methods.\n\nIf the proposed UAMP method and the alternative approaches do not yield satisfactory results, we can still leverage the insights gained from the experiments to inform future research directions. The project can be turned into an analysis paper that highlights the challenges and opportunities in uncertainty estimation for large language models, paving the way for further investigations in this area."
