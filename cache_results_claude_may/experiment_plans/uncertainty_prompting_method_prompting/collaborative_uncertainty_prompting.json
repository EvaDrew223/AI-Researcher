    "idea_name": "Collaborative Uncertainty Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often produce overconfident predictions when dealing with ambiguous or subjective tasks, such as sentiment analysis or hate speech detection. This leads to poorly calibrated confidence scores and limits the models' ability to defer to human judgment in uncertain cases.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to handling subjectivity and ambiguity in language understanding tasks include using ensemble methods, calibrating confidence scores based on human annotations, and incorporating external knowledge sources. However, these methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in subjective tasks and do not effectively leverage human expertise.",
        "Motivation": "By designing prompts that encourage collaboration between the language model and human experts, we can potentially improve the calibration of confidence scores and enable the model to defer to human judgment when faced with highly uncertain or subjective cases.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Collaborative Uncertainty Prompting (CUP), a novel prompting technique that facilitates collaboration between the language model and human experts in subjective language understanding tasks. The steps are as follows: 1) Given an input example, prompt the language model to predict the label and estimate its confidence score. 2) If the confidence score falls below a predefined threshold, indicating high uncertainty, generate a prompt that asks the model to identify the most ambiguous or subjective aspects of the input example. 3) Present the identified ambiguous aspects to a human expert and prompt them to provide their interpretation or judgment. 4) Incorporate the human expert's feedback into the model's prediction by updating the confidence score based on the expert's judgment and the model's initial uncertainty estimate. 5) If the updated confidence score still falls below the threshold, prompt the model to defer the final decision to the human expert.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CUP on benchmark datasets for subjective language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis (e.g., SST-2) and hate speech detection (e.g., OffensEval). Compare the calibration performance (e.g., ECE, MCE) and human agreement scores of CUP with baseline methods such as direct prediction and human-in-the-loop calibration. Conduct user studies to assess the effectiveness of CUP in facilitating collaboration between the model and human experts, and measure the impact of human feedback on the model's performance and calibration. Analyze the trade-off between the model's autonomy and the reliance on human expertise in different uncertainty thresholds and task settings."

The steps are as follows:\n1. Given an input example, prompt the language model to predict the label and estimate its confidence score.\n2. If the confidence score falls below a predefined threshold, indicating high uncertainty, generate a prompt that asks the model to identify the most ambiguous or subjective aspects of the input example.\n3.

If the updated confidence score still falls below the threshold, prompt the model to defer the final decision to the human expert.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate CUP on benchmark datasets for subjective language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis (e.g., SST-2) and hate speech detection (e.g., OffensEval).",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Initial prediction prompt: 'Given the input text: [input_text], predict the [task_name] label and provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.'\n2. Ambiguity identification prompt (if confidence score < threshold): 'Given the input text: [input_text], identify the most ambiguous or subjective aspects that make the [task_name] prediction uncertain.'\n3. Human expert prompt: 'Based on the input text: [input_text] and the identified ambiguous aspects: [ambiguous_aspects], provide your interpretation or judgment for the [task_name] task.'\n4. Confidence score update prompt: 'Given the initial confidence score: [initial_score], the human expert's judgment: [expert_judgment], and the model's initial uncertainty estimate: [uncertainty_estimate], update the confidence score for the [task_name] prediction.'\n5. Deferral prompt (if updated confidence score < threshold): 'Due to high uncertainty in the [task_name] prediction for the input text: [input_text], defer the final decision to the human expert.'",
            "Step 3: Set Hyperparameters": "1. Uncertainty threshold: Set a threshold (e.g., 0.7) below which the model is considered uncertain and requires human collaboration.\n2. Confidence score update function: Define a function that takes the initial confidence score, human expert's judgment, and the model's uncertainty estimate to update the confidence score (e.g., a weighted average).",
            "Step 4: Implement CUP": "1. For each input example, prompt the model for initial prediction and confidence score.\n2. If the confidence score is below the threshold, prompt the model to identify ambiguous aspects.\n3. Present the ambiguous aspects to a human expert and prompt for their judgment.\n4. Update the confidence score based on the expert's judgment and the model's uncertainty estimate.\n5. If the updated confidence score is still below the threshold, prompt the model to defer the final decision to the human expert.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Performance": "1. Compare the calibration performance (e.g., ECE, MCE) of CUP with baseline methods such as direct prediction and human-in-the-loop calibration.\n2. Measure the impact of human feedback on the model's performance and calibration.\n3. Analyze the trade-off between the model's autonomy and the reliance on human expertise in different uncertainty thresholds and task settings."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Input": "I'm not sure if I like this movie. The acting was good, but the plot was confusing.",
                "Baseline Output": "Sentiment: Negative, Confidence: 0.85",
                "CUP Output": "Initial prediction: Sentiment: Negative, Confidence: 0.6\nAmbiguous aspects: The reviewer expresses mixed feelings, praising the acting but criticizing the plot.\nHuman expert judgment: The sentiment seems to be mixed, leaning slightly negative due to the confusion caused by the plot.\nUpdated prediction: Sentiment: Negative, Confidence: 0.7\nFinal decision: Defer to human expert for final judgment due to the mixed sentiment and subjective nature of the review.",
                "Explanation": "CUP identifies the ambiguity in the review and seeks human expert judgment to refine the sentiment prediction and confidence score. The model defers the final decision to the human expert due to the inherent subjectivity of the task."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input": "This movie was an absolute masterpiece! The cinematography, acting, and storyline were all top-notch.",
                "Baseline Output": "Sentiment: Positive, Confidence: 0.95",
                "CUP Output": "Initial prediction: Sentiment: Positive, Confidence: 0.95\nFinal decision: Sentiment: Positive, Confidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "CUP does not seek human expert judgment for this example because the model's confidence score is above the uncertainty threshold, indicating a high degree of certainty in the sentiment prediction."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CUP method does not significantly improve the calibration performance or human agreement scores compared to the baseline methods, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated ambiguous aspects to ensure they accurately capture the sources of uncertainty in the input examples. Refine the ambiguity identification prompt if needed.\n2. Experiment with different confidence score update functions and uncertainty thresholds to optimize the trade-off between model autonomy and human intervention.\n3. Investigate the impact of human expert background and expertise on the effectiveness of CUP. Consider incorporating expert-specific weights or adapting the prompts to elicit more informative judgments.\n4. Explore alternative methods for integrating human feedback, such as fine-tuning the model on a subset of expert-annotated examples or using active learning techniques to selectively seek human judgment for the most informative examples.\n5. If CUP does not yield significant improvements, focus on analyzing the limitations of the proposed method and the challenges of calibrating confidence scores for subjective language understanding tasks. Use the insights gained from the experiments to inform future research directions and propose alternative approaches for handling uncertainty and subjectivity in these tasks."
