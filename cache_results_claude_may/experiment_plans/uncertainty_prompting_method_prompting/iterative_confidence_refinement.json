    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide well-calibrated confidence estimates for their generated responses, which can hinder their reliability and trustworthiness in real-world applications.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for confidence estimation in LLMs include using the model's output probabilities, generating multiple responses and measuring agreement, or fine-tuning the model with labeled confidence data.",
        "Motivation": "We propose an iterative prompting approach that progressively refines the LLM's confidence estimates by incorporating feedback and additional context. By engaging in a multi-turn dialogue with the model, we aim to improve the calibration and specificity of its confidence scores.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our Iterative Confidence Refinement (ICR) method consists of the following steps: 1) Initial Response Generation: Given a question, prompt the LLM to generate an initial response along with a confidence score. 2) User Feedback: Simulate user feedback by prompting the LLM to generate a follow-up question or comment that challenges the initial response or requests additional information. 3) Response Refinement: Prompt the LLM to refine its initial response based on the user feedback, incorporating additional context or clarification. 4) Confidence Re-estimation: Prompt the LLM to re-estimate its confidence in the refined response, taking into account the additional information and the user feedback. 5) Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until a satisfactory level of confidence is reached. 6) Final Response Generation: Generate the final response, along with the refined confidence score and a summary of the key points addressed during the iterative refinement process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the effectiveness of ICR on a diverse set of question-answering and dialogue datasets, comparing it against baseline confidence estimation methods. Measure the calibration of the generated confidence scores using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log Likelihood (NLL). Analyze the impact of the number of refinement iterations on the confidence calibration and the quality of the generated responses. Conduct human evaluation to assess the perceived trustworthiness, coherence, and informativeness of the responses generated using ICR, compared to baseline methods. Investigate the robustness of ICR to different types of user feedback and its ability to handle challenging or adversarial inputs."

        "Title": "Iterative Confidence Refinement: Improving Calibration and Specificity of Language Model Uncertainty Estimates",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide well-calibrated confidence estimates for their generated responses, which can hinder their reliability and trustworthiness in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches for confidence estimation in LLMs, such as using output probabilities, measuring agreement among multiple generated responses, or fine-tuning with labeled confidence data, have limitations. These methods may not capture the full context and nuances of the input, leading to overconfident or underconfident predictions. We propose an iterative prompting approach that progressively refines the LLM's confidence estimates by incorporating feedback and additional context. By engaging in a multi-turn dialogue with the model, we aim to improve the calibration and specificity of its confidence scores, enabling more reliable uncertainty estimation.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our Iterative Confidence Refinement (ICR) method consists of the following steps:\n1. Initial Response Generation: Given a question, prompt the LLM to generate an initial response along with a confidence score.\n2. User Feedback: Simulate user feedback by prompting the LLM to generate a follow-up question or comment that challenges the initial response or requests additional information.\n3. Response Refinement: Prompt the LLM to refine its initial response based on the user feedback, incorporating additional context or clarification.\n4. Confidence Re-estimation: Prompt the LLM to re-estimate its confidence in the refined response, taking into account the additional information and the user feedback.\n5. Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until a satisfactory level of confidence is reached.\n6. Final Response Generation: Generate the final response, along with the refined confidence score and a summary of the key points addressed during the iterative refinement process.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Evaluate the effectiveness of ICR on a diverse set of question-answering and dialogue datasets, such as SQuAD, TriviaQA, QuAC, and WoW. These datasets cover a range of domains and require different levels of reasoning and knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Compare ICR against the following baseline confidence estimation methods:\n1. Output Probability: Use the LLM's output probability as the confidence score.\n2. Multiple Response Agreement: Generate multiple responses and measure their agreement as the confidence score.\n3. Fine-tuned Confidence Prediction: Fine-tune the LLM with labeled confidence data to directly predict confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: Evaluation Metrics": "Measure the calibration of the generated confidence scores using the following metrics:\n1. Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Compute the average difference between the predicted confidence and the actual accuracy within each confidence bin.\n2. Negative Log Likelihood (NLL): Assess the quality of the confidence scores by treating them as probabilities and computing the negative log likelihood of the correct answers.\n3. Brier Score: Calculate the mean squared error between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes.",
            "Step 4: Hyperparameter Tuning": "Experiment with different hyperparameters for ICR, such as the number of refinement iterations, the type of user feedback (e.g., clarification questions, counterarguments), and the prompt templates for response refinement and confidence re-estimation. Use a validation set to select the best hyperparameters.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Evaluate ICR on different LLMs, such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and BERT-based models, to assess its effectiveness across various model architectures and sizes.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Study": "Conduct an ablation study to understand the impact of each component of ICR. Evaluate the performance of ICR without user feedback, without response refinement, and without confidence re-estimation. This will help identify the key contributors to the improved confidence calibration.",
            "Step 7: Robustness Analysis": "Assess the robustness of ICR to different types of user feedback, such as irrelevant or adversarial comments. Evaluate how well ICR handles challenging or out-of-distribution inputs and whether it can maintain well-calibrated confidence scores in these scenarios.",
            "Step 8: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a human evaluation to assess the perceived trustworthiness, coherence, and informativeness of the responses generated using ICR, compared to the baseline methods. Have human raters score the responses on these aspects and analyze the correlation between the refined confidence scores and human judgments.",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Perform a qualitative error analysis to identify common patterns or challenges in the refined responses and confidence scores. Examine cases where ICR significantly improves or degrades the confidence calibration and try to understand the underlying reasons.",
            "Step 10: Iteration and Refinement": "Based on the insights gained from the experiments, iterate on the ICR method and prompt templates to further improve its performance. Consider incorporating additional techniques, such as adversarial training or data augmentation, to enhance the robustness and generalization of ICR."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Question": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Baseline Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.9)",
                "User Feedback": "Can you provide more details about Paris being the capital of France?",
                "Refined Output": "Paris is the capital and largest city of France. It has been the country's capital since the 12th century and is known for its iconic landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. The French government and parliament are located in Paris, making it the political and administrative center of France. (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output provides a correct but brief answer with high confidence. After receiving user feedback requesting more details, ICR generates a refined response that includes additional relevant information about Paris being the capital of France. The refined output demonstrates a deeper understanding of the question and provides a more comprehensive answer, justifying the increased confidence score."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Question": "Who wrote the novel 'Pride and Prejudice'?",
                "Baseline Output": "The novel 'Pride and Prejudice' was written by Emily Bronte. (Confidence: 0.8)",
                "User Feedback": "Are you sure it was Emily Bronte who wrote 'Pride and Prejudice'? I thought it was written by someone else.",
                "Refined Output": "I apologize for my previous response. Upon further reflection, I realize that 'Pride and Prejudice' was actually written by Jane Austen, not Emily Bronte. Austen is known for her witty and insightful novels that explore themes of love, marriage, and social class in Regency-era England. (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "Explanation": "In this test case, the baseline output provides an incorrect answer with relatively high confidence. The user feedback challenges the initial response, prompting ICR to re-evaluate its answer. The refined output corrects the mistake, attributing the novel to its actual author, Jane Austen. The confidence score increases, reflecting the model's improved understanding and certainty after considering the user feedback and rectifying the error."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ICR method does not significantly improve the confidence calibration and specificity compared to the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated user feedback and refined responses to identify potential weaknesses or limitations in the prompting strategy. Modify the prompt templates or experiment with different types of feedback to better guide the refinement process.\n2. Explore alternative techniques for confidence estimation, such as Bayesian methods or ensemble-based approaches, and compare their performance with ICR.\n3. Investigate the impact of domain-specific knowledge on confidence calibration. Fine-tune the LLMs on domain-specific datasets or incorporate external knowledge sources to improve their understanding of the target domain and potentially enhance confidence estimation.\n4. Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between the LLMs' internal representations and confidence scores. Examine the attention weights, hidden states, or other intermediate outputs to gain insights into how the models arrive at their confidence estimates and identify potential areas for improvement.\n5. If the ICR method shows promise but falls short of the desired performance, consider extending the research into a more comprehensive analysis of iterative prompting techniques for confidence refinement. Explore variations of the approach, such as using different types of feedback, incorporating human-in-the-loop interactions, or combining ICR with other confidence calibration methods.\nBy thoroughly investigating the limitations and potential improvements of the ICR method, the research can still provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of confidence estimation in LLMs, even if the initial results do not meet the expected success criteria."
