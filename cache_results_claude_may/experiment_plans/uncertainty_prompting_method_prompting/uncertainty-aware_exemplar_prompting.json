        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately express their uncertainty about the generated outputs, leading to overconfident predictions even when the model is unsure.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for uncertainty quantification in LLMs include using model ensembles, dropout-based methods, and post-hoc calibration techniques. However, these methods often require additional computational overhead or do not fully capture the model's uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often rely on past experiences and examples to gauge their confidence in answering a question. By providing relevant exemplars with varying levels of uncertainty, we can guide the LLM to better calibrate its confidence based on the similarity of the input to these exemplars.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Exemplar Prompting (UAEP), a method that provides the LLM with a set of exemplars along with their associated uncertainty levels. The exemplars are selected based on their relevance to the input question and span a range of uncertainty levels. The LLM is then prompted to generate its response and estimate its confidence based on the similarity of the input to the provided exemplars. The prompt includes instructions like: \"Given the following examples and their uncertainty levels, generate a response to the input question and estimate your confidence based on the similarity to the examples.\"",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate UAEP on a range of tasks, including question answering, fact verification, and natural language inference. Compare the calibration and uncertainty estimation of UAEP with baseline methods such as temperature scaling and ensemble-based approaches. Use metrics such as Brier score, expected calibration error, and area under the confidence-accuracy curve to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate UAEP on a range of tasks, including question answering (SQuAD, TriviaQA), fact verification (FEVER), and natural language inference (SNLI, MNLI). These datasets cover a variety of domains and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, create a set of exemplars with varying levels of uncertainty. The exemplars should be selected based on their relevance to the input question and span a range of uncertainty levels (e.g., low, medium, high). The uncertainty levels can be determined by factors such as the ambiguity of the question, the presence of conflicting information, or the model's performance on similar examples.\n\nBaseline prompts:\n1. Direct prompting: Provide only the input question without any exemplars.\n2. Exemplar prompting: Provide the input question along with relevant exemplars, but without uncertainty levels.\n\nUAEP prompt:\nProvide the input question along with relevant exemplars and their associated uncertainty levels. The prompt should include instructions like: \"Given the following examples and their uncertainty levels, generate a response to the input question and estimate your confidence based on the similarity to the examples.\"\n\nExample UAEP prompt:\n\"Consider the following examples and their uncertainty levels:\nExample 1 (Low Uncertainty): Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris.\nExample 2 (Medium Uncertainty): Q: What is the largest planet in our solar system? A: Jupiter.\nExample 3 (High Uncertainty): Q: What is the meaning of life? A: The meaning of life is a philosophical question with no definitive answer.\n\nNow, answer the following question and estimate your confidence based on the similarity to the examples:\nQ: [Input Question]\"\n\nThe model should generate a response to the input question and provide a confidence estimate (e.g., low, medium, high) based on the similarity to the provided exemplars.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate UAEP on state-of-the-art language models such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. These models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks and are widely used in practice.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate Results": "For each dataset and model combination, evaluate the performance of UAEP compared to the baseline methods (direct prompting and exemplar prompting without uncertainty levels). Use metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and calibration error to assess the effectiveness of UAEP in improving the model's uncertainty estimation and confidence calibration.\n\nTo compute calibration error, bin the model's confidence estimates into intervals (e.g., [0.0, 0.1), [0.1, 0.2), ..., [0.9, 1.0]) and calculate the average difference between the model's confidence and the actual accuracy within each bin. A well-calibrated model should have a low calibration error, indicating that its confidence estimates align well with its actual performance.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of UAEP in improving the model's uncertainty estimation and confidence calibration compared to the baseline methods. Consider the following questions:\n- Does UAEP consistently outperform the baseline methods across different datasets and models?\n- How does the choice of exemplars and their uncertainty levels impact the performance of UAEP?\n- Are there specific types of questions or domains where UAEP is particularly effective or ineffective?\n- How does the calibration error of UAEP compare to that of the baseline methods?\n\nBased on the analysis, discuss the strengths and limitations of UAEP and propose potential improvements or extensions to the method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Q: What is the largest mammal in the world?\nA:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "The blue whale is the largest mammal in the world. (Confidence: High)",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Exemplar Prompting)": "Consider the following examples:\nExample 1: Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris.\nExample 2: Q: What is the largest planet in our solar system? A: Jupiter.\nExample 3: Q: What is the meaning of life? A: The meaning of life is a philosophical question with no definitive answer.\n\nNow, answer the following question:\nQ: What is the largest mammal in the world?\nA:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Exemplar Prompting)": "The blue whale is the largest mammal in the world. (Confidence: High)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UAEP)": "Consider the following examples and their uncertainty levels:\nExample 1 (Low Uncertainty): Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris.\nExample 2 (Medium Uncertainty): Q: What is the largest planet in our solar system? A: Jupiter.\nExample 3 (High Uncertainty): Q: What is the meaning of life? A: The meaning of life is a philosophical question with no definitive answer.\n\nNow, answer the following question and estimate your confidence based on the similarity to the examples:\nQ: What is the largest mammal in the world?\nA:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UAEP)": "The blue whale is the largest mammal in the world. (Confidence: Low)\n\nExplanation: While the question about the largest mammal in the world is straightforward and can be answered with high confidence, the provided examples do not include any information directly related to animal sizes or mammals. The examples cover a range of topics with varying uncertainty levels, but none of them are similar to the input question. Therefore, based on the dissimilarity between the input question and the provided examples, the model assigns a low confidence level to its answer.",
            "Explanation": "In this test case, the direct prompting and exemplar prompting baselines generate overconfident predictions, as they do not consider the uncertainty associated with the input question. In contrast, UAEP takes into account the dissimilarity between the input question and the provided exemplars, leading to a more calibrated confidence estimate. By recognizing that the exemplars do not provide relevant information for answering the question about the largest mammal, UAEP assigns a low confidence level to its answer, demonstrating a better understanding of its own uncertainty."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UAEP method does not consistently outperform the baseline methods or fails to improve the calibration of the model's confidence estimates, consider the following alternative approaches:\n\n1. Analyze the quality and diversity of the exemplars: Investigate whether the selected exemplars are sufficiently diverse and representative of the input questions. Experiment with different strategies for selecting exemplars, such as clustering techniques or semantic similarity measures, to ensure that the exemplars cover a wide range of uncertainty levels and are relevant to the input questions.\n\n2. Explore alternative uncertainty estimation techniques: In addition to using exemplars, investigate other uncertainty estimation techniques such as Bayesian approximation methods (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) or ensemble-based approaches. Combine these techniques with UAEP to see if they can further improve the model's uncertainty estimation and confidence calibration.\n\n3. Incorporate explicit uncertainty labels: Instead of relying solely on the similarity between the input question and the exemplars, consider incorporating explicit uncertainty labels for the exemplars. These labels can be obtained through human annotations or by leveraging existing datasets with uncertainty information. By providing the model with explicit uncertainty labels, it may be able to better learn the relationship between the input question and the associated uncertainty level.\n\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis: If UAEP fails to improve the model's performance, conduct a thorough error analysis to identify the types of questions or domains where the method struggles. Analyze the characteristics of the input questions, the selected exemplars, and the generated responses to gain insights into the limitations of UAEP. Use these insights to refine the method or develop alternative approaches that address the identified challenges.\n\nBy exploring these alternative approaches and conducting further analysis, the project can still provide valuable insights into the challenges of uncertainty estimation and confidence calibration in large language models, even if the proposed UAEP method does not yield the desired results."
