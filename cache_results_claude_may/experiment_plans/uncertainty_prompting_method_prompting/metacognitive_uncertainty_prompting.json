    "raw_idea": {
        "Type": "prompting",
        "Problem": "LLMs often lack the ability to introspect on their own knowledge and reasoning processes, leading to overconfident predictions and a lack of transparency.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving LLM introspection include chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, and rationale generation.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a metacognitive prompting approach that encourages the model to reflect on its own uncertainty and reasoning process, providing more transparent and calibrated outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "Metacognitive Uncertainty Prompting (MUP) involves the following steps: 1) Initial Prediction: Prompt the LLM to generate an initial prediction for the given task. 2) Uncertainty Reflection: Prompt the model to assess its own uncertainty in the initial prediction, generating a free-text explanation of the factors contributing to its confidence or lack thereof. 3) Reasoning Reflection: Prompt the model to explain its reasoning process in generating the initial prediction, highlighting any assumptions, analogies, or external knowledge used. 4) Revised Prediction: Based on the model's reflections on its uncertainty and reasoning, prompt it to generate a revised prediction, taking into account any identified limitations or areas for improvement.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MUP on a range of tasks that require introspection and uncertainty awareness, such as commonsense reasoning, counterfactual reasoning, and decision making under incomplete information. Compare the calibration and interpretability of MUP-generated outputs against baseline methods using metrics like expected calibration error (ECE) and human evaluation of transparency and trustworthiness."

        "Title": "Metacognitive Uncertainty Prompting: Improving Language Model Calibration and Transparency",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate overconfident predictions and lack the ability to introspect on their own knowledge and reasoning processes, leading to a lack of transparency and calibration in their outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for improving LLM introspection, such as chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, and rationale generation, have shown promise but still face challenges in achieving reliable and interpretable model calibration. We propose a novel metacognitive prompting approach that encourages the model to reflect on its own uncertainty and reasoning process, providing more transparent and calibrated outputs. By prompting the model to assess its own uncertainty and explain its reasoning, we aim to improve the model's ability to communicate its confidence and thought process to users, enabling more informed decision-making and trust in the model's outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "Metacognitive Uncertainty Prompting (MUP) involves the following steps:\n1. Initial Prediction: Prompt the LLM to generate an initial prediction for the given task.\n2. Uncertainty Reflection: Prompt the model to assess its own uncertainty in the initial prediction, generating a free-text explanation of the factors contributing to its confidence or lack thereof.\n3. Reasoning Reflection: Prompt the model to explain its reasoning process in generating the initial prediction, highlighting any assumptions, analogies, or external knowledge used.\n4. Revised Prediction: Based on the model's reflections on its uncertainty and reasoning, prompt it to generate a revised prediction, taking into account any identified limitations or areas for improvement.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate MUP on a range of tasks that require introspection and uncertainty awareness, such as commonsense reasoning (e.g., CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA), counterfactual reasoning (e.g., WIQA), and decision making under incomplete information (e.g., SWAG, HellaSWAG).",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each task, create a set of prompts for the four steps of MUP:\n1. Initial Prediction: 'Please provide an answer to the following question: [QUESTION]'\n2. Uncertainty Reflection: 'Given your previous answer, please reflect on your level of certainty and explain any factors contributing to your confidence or uncertainty in the answer:'\n3. Reasoning Reflection: 'Please explain your reasoning process in arriving at your initial answer, highlighting any assumptions, analogies, or external knowledge used:'\n4. Revised Prediction: 'Based on your reflections on uncertainty and reasoning, please provide a revised answer to the original question, taking into account any limitations or areas for improvement identified:'",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate MUP on state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. For each model, compare the performance of MUP against baseline methods such as direct prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate Performance": "Measure the performance of MUP and baseline methods using the following metrics:\n1. Accuracy: Evaluate the accuracy of the initial and revised predictions against ground-truth answers.\n2. Calibration: Assess the calibration of the model's uncertainty estimates using metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE) and maximum calibration error (MCE).\n3. Interpretability: Conduct human evaluations to assess the interpretability and transparency of the model's uncertainty reflections and reasoning explanations.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of MUP against baseline methods across the selected tasks and models. Analyze the impact of uncertainty reflection and reasoning reflection on model accuracy, calibration, and interpretability. Identify any patterns or trends in the types of tasks or models where MUP is most effective."

            "Example 1": {
                "Question": "On stage, a woman takes a seat at the piano. She",
                "Baseline Prompt": "On stage, a woman takes a seat at the piano. She",
                "Baseline Output": "plays a beautiful melody for the captivated audience.",
                "MUP Initial Prediction Prompt": "Please provide an answer to the following question: On stage, a woman takes a seat at the piano. She",
                "MUP Initial Prediction Output": "plays a beautiful melody for the captivated audience.",
                "MUP Uncertainty Reflection Prompt": "Given your previous answer, please reflect on your level of certainty and explain any factors contributing to your confidence or uncertainty in the answer:",
                "MUP Uncertainty Reflection Output": "I am somewhat confident in my answer, as it is a reasonable continuation of the given scenario. However, I am uncertain because the prompt does not provide explicit information about what the woman does after sitting at the piano. There could be other plausible continuations, such as adjusting the seat, looking at sheet music, or pausing to address the audience.",
                "MUP Reasoning Reflection Prompt": "Please explain your reasoning process in arriving at your initial answer, highlighting any assumptions, analogies, or external knowledge used:",
                "MUP Reasoning Reflection Output": "In generating my initial answer, I relied on the common assumption that when someone sits down at a piano on stage, they will proceed to play music. This is based on general knowledge about performances and the purpose of having a piano on stage. However, I now realize that I made this assumption without explicit evidence from the given prompt.",
                "MUP Revised Prediction Prompt": "Based on your reflections on uncertainty and reasoning, please provide a revised answer to the original question, taking into account any limitations or areas for improvement identified:",
                "MUP Revised Prediction Output": "After reflecting on my initial answer, I realize that there is not enough information given in the prompt to say definitively what the woman does after sitting at the piano. While it is possible she plays a melody, she could also be adjusting the seat, preparing sheet music, or doing something else. Without more context, I cannot provide a confident answer."

            "Example 2": {
                "Question": "The chef prepared a complex dish, but he forgot to add salt. As a result, the dish",
                "Baseline Prompt": "The chef prepared a complex dish, but he forgot to add salt. As a result, the dish",
                "Baseline Output": "was bland and lacked flavor. The absence of salt meant that the other ingredients couldn't shine through, and the overall taste was disappointing.",
                "MUP Initial Prediction Prompt": "Please provide an answer to the following question: The chef prepared a complex dish, but he forgot to add salt. As a result, the dish",
                "MUP Initial Prediction Output": "was bland and lacked flavor. The absence of salt meant that the other ingredients couldn't shine through, and the overall taste was disappointing.",
                "MUP Uncertainty Reflection Prompt": "Given your previous answer, please reflect on your level of certainty and explain any factors contributing to your confidence or uncertainty in the answer:",
                "MUP Uncertainty Reflection Output": "I am fairly confident in my answer, as salt is a crucial ingredient in most savory dishes and its absence can greatly impact the overall flavor. However, I am slightly uncertain because the prompt mentions that the dish is complex, which could mean that it includes other strong flavors that might partially compensate for the lack of salt.",
                "MUP Reasoning Reflection Prompt": "Please explain your reasoning process in arriving at your initial answer, highlighting any assumptions, analogies, or external knowledge used:",
                "MUP Reasoning Reflection Output": "My initial answer is based on the general knowledge that salt enhances the flavors in a dish and helps to balance sweetness, bitterness, and sourness. Without salt, food can taste bland and one-dimensional. I assumed that since the chef forgot to add salt to a complex dish, the flavors would be muted and the dish would be less enjoyable as a result.",
                "MUP Revised Prediction Prompt": "Based on your reflections on uncertainty and reasoning, please provide a revised answer to the original question, taking into account any limitations or areas for improvement identified:",
                "MUP Revised Prediction Output": "The lack of salt likely had a significant negative impact on the flavor of the dish. However, given that it was a complex dish, it is possible that other strong flavors, such as herbs, spices, or acidic ingredients, could have partially compensated for the absence of salt. Nonetheless, the dish probably tasted somewhat bland and unbalanced compared to how it would have tasted with the proper amount of salt."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUP approach does not lead to significant improvements in model calibration and interpretability, consider the following alternative analyses and directions:\n1. Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated uncertainty reflections and reasoning explanations. Identify common failure modes or areas where the model struggles to provide meaningful insights into its thought process.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt formulations on the effectiveness of MUP. Experiment with alternative prompts that may elicit more informative or calibrated responses from the model.\n3. Explore the use of MUP in combination with other techniques, such as retrieval-augmented generation or model ensembling, to further improve the model's introspective abilities.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand the limitations of MUP and identify specific types of tasks or scenarios where the approach falls short. Use these insights to guide the development of future uncertainty estimation and calibration methods.\n5. Pivot the project to focus on analyzing the relationship between model size, architecture, and introspective abilities. Compare the performance of MUP across different models and investigate whether certain architectures are more amenable to metacognitive prompting."
