    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Confidence calibration for language models often relies on a single prompt or a fixed set of prompts, which may not capture the full range of uncertainty in the model's predictions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for confidence calibration, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, typically operate on the model's output distribution for a single prompt. Some recent work has explored using multiple prompts, but these approaches often rely on simple averaging or majority voting.",
        "Motivation": "Different prompts can elicit different types of knowledge and reasoning from a language model, and the model's confidence may vary depending on the prompt used. By treating each prompt as a separate evidence source and combining them using Bayesian inference, we can obtain a more principled and robust estimate of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Bayesian Prompt Fusion, a method that treats the model's responses to different prompts as independent evidence sources and combines them using Bayesian inference. For each prompt, the model generates a response and an associated confidence score. These scores are then treated as likelihood terms in a Bayesian model, with the prior distribution representing our initial beliefs about the model's confidence. The posterior distribution, obtained via Bayes' rule, represents our updated beliefs about the model's confidence after observing its responses to the different prompts. The final confidence score is derived from this posterior distribution, e.g., by taking the mean or median.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Bayesian Prompt Fusion on a range of language understanding and generation tasks, such as question answering, natural language inference, and open-ended generation. For each task, we will design a set of diverse prompts that probe different aspects of the model's knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We will compare the calibration and accuracy of Bayesian Prompt Fusion against baseline methods that use a single prompt or a simple combination of multiple prompts. We will also investigate the impact of different prior distributions and likelihood functions on the performance of Bayesian Prompt Fusion."

        "Title": "Bayesian Prompt Fusion: Quantifying Uncertainty in Language Models through Multi-Prompt Inference",
        "Problem Statement": "Confidence calibration for language models often relies on a single prompt or a fixed set of prompts, which may not capture the full range of uncertainty in the model's predictions.",

The final confidence score is derived from this posterior distribution, e.g., by taking the mean or median.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Select Datasets": "We will evaluate Bayesian Prompt Fusion on a range of language understanding and generation tasks, such as question answering (SQuAD, TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions), natural language inference (MNLI, SNLI, ANLI), and open-ended generation (WritingPrompts, CNN/DailyMail, XSum). These datasets cover a diverse set of tasks and domains, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of our method in different settings.",
            "Step 2: Design Prompts": "For each task, we will design a set of diverse prompts that probe different aspects of the model's knowledge and reasoning capabilities. These prompts will be crafted to elicit different types of responses from the model, such as direct answers, explanations, or step-by-step reasoning. We will also include prompts that are designed to be ambiguous or underspecified, to test the model's ability to express uncertainty in these cases. Example prompts for question answering could include: \"Answer the following question:\", \"Provide a detailed explanation for the answer to the following question:\", and \"Given the limited information provided, what is your best guess for the answer to the following question?\"",
            "Step 3: Generate Model Responses": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 to generate responses and confidence scores for each prompt-question pair. The confidence scores will be obtained by using a separate prompt that asks the model to assess its confidence in its previous response, e.g., \"On a scale from 1 to 10, how confident are you in your previous answer?\". We will generate multiple responses for each prompt-question pair to account for the stochasticity in the model's outputs.",
            "Step 4: Implement Bayesian Prompt Fusion": "We will implement Bayesian Prompt Fusion using PyMC3, a probabilistic programming library for Python. The likelihood function will be based on the confidence scores generated by the model, assuming a suitable probability distribution (e.g., Beta distribution for scores between 0 and 1). The prior distribution will be chosen based on our initial beliefs about the model's confidence (e.g., a uniform distribution to represent maximum uncertainty). We will use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to approximate the posterior distribution and derive the final confidence scores.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate and Compare": "We will evaluate the performance of Bayesian Prompt Fusion in terms of calibration and accuracy. Calibration will be measured using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), which quantify how well the model's confidence scores align with its actual accuracy. Accuracy will be measured using task-specific metrics such as F1 score for question answering and BLEU score for generation. We will compare Bayesian Prompt Fusion against baseline methods that use a single prompt or a simple combination of multiple prompts (e.g., averaging, majority voting). We will also investigate the impact of different prior distributions and likelihood functions on the performance of our method.",
            "Step 6: Analyze and Interpret": "We will analyze the posterior distributions obtained from Bayesian Prompt Fusion to gain insights into the model's uncertainty and the contributions of different prompts. We will identify prompts that consistently lead to high-confidence or low-confidence predictions, and examine the model's responses to these prompts to understand the reasons behind its confidence levels. We will also investigate cases where the model's confidence scores differ significantly across prompts, and explore whether these differences can be attributed to factors such as the complexity of the question, the ambiguity of the prompt, or the model's knowledge gaps."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Bayesian Prompt Fusion method does not lead to improved confidence calibration or accuracy compared to the baselines, we will conduct additional analyses to understand the reasons behind its failure. These analyses could include:\n1. Examining the quality and diversity of the prompts used in the experiments. If the prompts are too similar or do not effectively probe different aspects of the model's knowledge and reasoning, the method may not provide significant benefits over using a single prompt.\n2. Investigating the appropriateness of the chosen prior distributions and likelihood functions. If these components do not accurately capture the model's uncertainty or the relationship between confidence scores and accuracy, the resulting posterior distributions may not be informative.\n3. Analyzing the consistency and reliability of the model's confidence scores across different prompts and responses. If the confidence scores are highly variable or do not align with the model's actual performance, the effectiveness of Bayesian Prompt Fusion may be limited.\n4. Comparing the performance of Bayesian Prompt Fusion across different models and datasets. If the method works well for some models or tasks but not others, it may indicate limitations in its generalizability or robustness.\nBased on the findings from these analyses, we will consider alternative approaches or modifications to the Bayesian Prompt Fusion method. These could include:\n1. Developing techniques for automatically generating diverse and informative prompts, rather than relying on manually designed prompts.\n2. Exploring different probability distributions or confidence scoring mechanisms to better capture the model's uncertainty.\n3. Incorporating additional sources of information, such as the model's internal representations or attention weights, to inform the confidence estimation process.\n4. Investigating the use of alternative inference techniques, such as variational inference or expectation propagation, to approximate the posterior distribution more efficiently or accurately.\nIf the proposed method and its variations still do not yield satisfactory results, we will focus on analyzing and understanding the factors that contribute to the model's uncertainty and the limitations of confidence calibration using prompting-based methods. This could involve conducting ablation studies, analyzing the model's behavior on specific types of questions or prompts, or comparing the effectiveness of prompting-based calibration across different model architectures and sizes. The insights gained from these analyses could inform the development of new methods for confidence calibration or highlight the need for alternative approaches, such as fine-tuning or post-processing techniques."
