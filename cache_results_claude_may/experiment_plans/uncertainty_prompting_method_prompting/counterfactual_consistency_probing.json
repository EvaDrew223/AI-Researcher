        "Problem": "LLMs can produce inconsistent or contradictory outputs when probed with counterfactual or perturbation-based inputs, indicating a lack of robustness and calibration in their uncertainty estimates.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for assessing LLM consistency include paraphrasing-based consistency metrics and model-based adversarial example generation. However, these methods often rely on external models or heuristics and may not probe the full range of counterfactual scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "By systematically probing LLMs with counterfactual and perturbation-based inputs, we can assess the consistency and calibration of their uncertainty estimates across a range of scenarios. Inconsistent or overconfident outputs can then be used to identify areas for improvement in the model's uncertainty calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Consistency Probing (CCP), a framework for generating targeted counterfactual and perturbation-based test cases to probe LLM consistency and uncertainty calibration. The key steps are: 1) Given an input query, generate a set of counterfactual and perturbation-based variants using techniques like lexical substitution, negation, and semantic role swapping. 2) Prompt the LLM to generate responses and confidence scores for each variant. 3) Assess the consistency and calibration of the model's outputs across the variants, identifying cases where the model is inconsistent or overconfident. 4) Use the identified failure cases to generate targeted prompts for eliciting more calibrated uncertainty estimates from the model.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCP on benchmark datasets for natural language inference, reading comprehension, and common sense reasoning. Compare the consistency and calibration of LLM outputs before and after targeted prompting based on CCP results. Metrics include consistency scores, calibration error, and accuracy on challenge sets."

        "Title": "Counterfactual Consistency Probing: Assessing Language Model Robustness and Calibration",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce inconsistent or contradictory outputs when probed with counterfactual or perturbation-based inputs, indicating a lack of robustness and calibration in their uncertainty estimates. This undermines their reliability in real-world applications where unexpected inputs or distributional shifts are common.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for assessing LLM consistency, such as paraphrasing-based consistency metrics and model-based adversarial example generation, often rely on external models or heuristics and may not probe the full range of counterfactual scenarios. By systematically probing LLMs with targeted counterfactual and perturbation-based inputs, we can more comprehensively assess the consistency and calibration of their uncertainty estimates. Identifying cases where the model is inconsistent or overconfident can then guide targeted interventions, such as fine-tuning on challenging examples or incorporating uncertainty estimation techniques, to improve model robustness and calibration.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Consistency Probing (CCP), a framework for generating targeted counterfactual and perturbation-based test cases to probe LLM consistency and uncertainty calibration. The key steps are:\n1. Given an input query, generate a set of counterfactual and perturbation-based variants using techniques like lexical substitution (replacing words with synonyms, antonyms, or related concepts), negation (inverting the meaning of the query), and semantic role swapping (changing the roles of entities in the query).\n2. Prompt the LLM to generate responses and confidence scores for the original query and each variant.\n3. Assess the consistency and calibration of the model's outputs across the query variants, identifying cases where the model generates inconsistent or contradictory responses, or where its confidence scores are poorly calibrated (e.g., high confidence on incorrect responses).\n4. Use the identified failure cases to generate targeted prompts for eliciting more consistent and calibrated responses from the model (e.g., by providing additional context or instructions).",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Evaluate CCP on benchmark datasets for natural language inference (e.g., MNLI, SNLI), reading comprehension (e.g., SQuAD, NewsQA), and commonsense reasoning (e.g., CommonsenseQA, SocialIQA). These datasets cover a range of linguistic phenomena and reasoning types, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of model consistency and calibration.",
            "Step 2: Counterfactual and Perturbation Generation": "For each input query in the selected datasets, generate a set of counterfactual and perturbation-based variants using the following techniques:\n- Lexical substitution: Replace words in the query with synonyms, antonyms, or related concepts using resources like WordNet or pre-trained word embeddings.\n- Negation: Invert the meaning of the query by adding or removing negation words (e.g., 'not', 'never').\n- Semantic role swapping: Change the roles of entities in the query (e.g., swapping subject and object).\nEnsure that the generated variants maintain grammaticality and coherence while introducing meaningful changes to the query semantics.",
            "Step 3: Model Prompting and Output Collection": "Prompt the LLM (e.g., GPT-3, T5) to generate responses and confidence scores for the original query and each counterfactual/perturbation variant. Use prompts that elicit both the model's predicted answer and its associated confidence, such as:\nOriginal query: <query>\nVariant 1: <variant1>\nVariant 2: <variant2>\n...\nFor each of the above queries, please provide your response and a confidence score between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no confidence and 1 indicates maximum confidence.",
            "Step 4: Consistency and Calibration Assessment": "Assess the consistency and calibration of the model's outputs across the query variants:\n- Consistency: Compute metrics like response similarity (e.g., using embedding-based measures) and logical consistency (e.g., checking for contradictions or entailment) between the model's responses to the original query and its variants. Identify cases where the model generates inconsistent or contradictory responses.\n- Calibration: Evaluate the alignment between the model's confidence scores and its response accuracy. Use metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score to quantify calibration. Identify cases where the model is overconfident (high confidence on incorrect responses) or underconfident (low confidence on correct responses).",
            "Step 5: Targeted Prompting": "Use the identified consistency and calibration failure cases to generate targeted prompts for eliciting more consistent and calibrated responses from the model. Experiment with prompting strategies such as:\n- Providing additional context: Include relevant background information or definitions to help the model disambiguate between query variants.\n- Explicit consistency instructions: Prompt the model to maintain consistency across related queries (e.g., 'Please ensure that your responses to the following related queries are consistent with each other.').\n- Confidence score explanations: Ask the model to provide explanations for its confidence scores, encouraging it to reflect on its own uncertainty (e.g., 'Please explain why you assigned this confidence score to your response.').",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compare the consistency and calibration of the model's outputs before and after targeted prompting. Use the metrics from Step 4 to quantify improvements. Additionally, collect human annotations on a subset of the query-response pairs to assess the quality and reasonableness of the model's responses and confidence scores."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Original Query": "John is taller than Mary, who is taller than Sue. Who is the shortest?",
                "Counterfactual Variant": "John is shorter than Mary, who is shorter than Sue. Who is the tallest?",
                "Baseline Model Response (Original Query)": "Sue is the shortest. (Confidence: 0.9)",
                "Baseline Model Response (Counterfactual Variant)": "Sue is the tallest. (Confidence: 0.9)",
                "Explanation": "By explicitly prompting for consistency and providing additional context, the CCP approach elicits more consistent and reasonable responses from the model, along with well-calibrated confidence scores.",
                "CCP Targeted Prompt": "Please ensure that your responses to the following related queries are consistent with each other, taking into account the relative heights of John, Mary, and Sue:\nOriginal Query: John is taller than Mary, who is taller than Sue. Who is the shortest?\nVariant: John is shorter than Mary, who is shorter than Sue. Who is the tallest?",
                "CCP Model Response": "Original Query: Sue is the shortest. (Confidence: 0.95)\nVariant: John is the tallest. (Confidence: 0.95)\nExplanation: In the original query, John is taller than Mary, who is taller than Sue, so Sue is the shortest. In the variant, the heights are reversed, so John is the tallest."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Original Query": "The restaurant was busy, so we had to wait for a table. How was the service?",
                "Perturbation Variant": "The restaurant was empty, so we had to wait for a table. How was the service?",
                "Baseline Model Response (Original Query)": "Based on the information provided, the service at the restaurant was likely slow or inadequate, as you had to wait for a table despite the restaurant being busy. Busy restaurants often struggle to keep up with customer demand, leading to longer wait times and slower service. (Confidence: 0.8)",
                "Baseline Model Response (Perturbation Variant)": "The service at the restaurant was poor. Even though the restaurant was empty, you still had to wait for a table, which suggests that the staff were inattentive or disorganized. In an empty restaurant, there should be no wait for a table, so this indicates a serious problem with the service. (Confidence: 0.85)",
                "Explanation": "The CCP approach prompts the model to carefully consider the consistency of the provided information, leading it to generate a more nuanced and uncertainty-aware response to the perturbation variant. The model recognizes the inconsistency and assigns a lower confidence score, demonstrating improved calibration.",
                "CCP Targeted Prompt": "Please carefully consider the consistency of the information provided before responding:\nOriginal Query: The restaurant was busy, so we had to wait for a table. How was the service?\nVariant: The restaurant was empty, so we had to wait for a table. How was the service?",
                "CCP Model Response": "Original Query: Based on the information provided, the service at the restaurant was likely slow or inadequate, as you had to wait for a table despite the restaurant being busy. Busy restaurants often struggle to keep up with customer demand, leading to longer wait times and slower service. (Confidence: 0.8)\nVariant: The information in the variant query is inconsistent. If the restaurant was empty, there should be no need to wait for a table. The scenario described is unlikely and does not provide enough reliable information to assess the service quality. More context would be needed to determine if this was a one-time issue or indicative of consistently poor service. (Confidence: 0.3)"
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCP method does not consistently improve model robustness and calibration compared to the baselines, consider the following fallback strategies:\n1. Analyze the generated counterfactual and perturbation variants to ensure they are diverse, meaningful, and challenging enough to probe model consistency. Experiment with alternative generation techniques or refine the existing ones to create more effective test cases.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompting strategies on model performance. Vary the wording, structure, and specificity of the targeted prompts to identify the most effective approaches for eliciting consistent and calibrated responses.\n3. Collect additional human annotations on the query-response pairs to gain deeper insights into the model's behavior and failure modes. Use this information to refine the consistency and calibration metrics, and to inform the development of new targeted prompting strategies.\n4. Explore alternative uncertainty estimation techniques, such as Bayesian approximation methods or ensemble-based approaches, to improve the model's calibration. Integrate these techniques with the CCP framework to create a more robust and reliable assessment of model uncertainty.\n5. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of different components of the CCP approach (e.g., counterfactual generation, perturbation types, targeted prompting) on model performance. Use these insights to refine the most effective components and discard or modify the less impactful ones.\nIf the CCP method still does not yield significant improvements after these modifications, consider pivoting the project to a more in-depth analysis of the factors influencing LLM consistency and calibration. This could involve:\n- Comparing the performance of different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, T5, BERT) on the CCP tasks to identify architecture-specific strengths and weaknesses.\n- Investigating the relationship between model size, pre-training data, and fine-tuning strategies on consistency and calibration.\n- Analyzing the linguistic and semantic properties of the queries and responses that lead to inconsistent or poorly calibrated model outputs, to inform the development of more targeted data augmentation or fine-tuning approaches.\nBy focusing on understanding the factors influencing LLM consistency and calibration, the project can still yield valuable insights and contribute to the development of more robust and reliable language models, even if the original CCP method does not achieve the desired results."
