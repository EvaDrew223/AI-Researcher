        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, leading to unreliable outputs in real-world applications.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for confidence calibration in LLMs include temperature scaling, ensembling, and post-hoc calibration using additional models.",

        "Title": "Calibrated Consensus Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, leading to unreliable outputs in real-world applications. This can be problematic in high-stakes scenarios where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence calibration in LLMs, such as temperature scaling, ensembling, and post-hoc calibration using additional models, have limitations. Temperature scaling and ensembling can be computationally expensive, while post-hoc calibration requires training additional models. Inspired by the wisdom of crowds, we hypothesize that prompting an LLM to generate multiple diverse responses and assessing their consensus can provide a more reliable estimate of the model's confidence without the need for additional training or computation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Calibrated Consensus Prompting (CCP), a novel prompting approach that involves three main steps:\n1. Diverse Response Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate multiple responses to the same input, encouraging diversity through techniques like nucleus sampling or diverse beam search.\n2. Consensus Assessment: Analyze the generated responses to quantify their agreement, using metrics such as semantic similarity or exact match.\n3. Confidence Calibration: Calibrate the model's confidence based on the degree of consensus among the generated responses, assigning higher confidence to inputs with strong agreement and lower confidence to those with divergent responses.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate CCP on a range of tasks, including question answering (SQuAD, TriviaQA), natural language inference (MNLI, SNLI), and text classification (AG News, DBpedia). These datasets cover different domains and task types to assess the generalizability of the proposed method.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each task, create a set of prompts that encourage diverse response generation. Example prompts for question answering:\n- 'Provide a concise answer to the following question:'\n- 'Generate a detailed response to the given question:'\n- 'Answer the question below, considering multiple perspectives:'\nFor natural language inference and text classification, use prompts like:\n- 'Determine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis:'\n- 'Classify the given text into one of the following categories:'\nAppend the input (question, premise-hypothesis pair, or text) to these prompts.",
            "Step 3: Generate Diverse Responses": "For each input, use the constructed prompts to generate multiple responses from the LLM. Experiment with different diversity-promoting techniques:\n- Nucleus sampling: Set a probability threshold (e.g., 0.9) and sample from the top tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold.\n- Diverse beam search: Maintain a beam of diverse candidates during decoding, penalizing similar responses.\nGenerate 3-5 responses per input to balance diversity and computational efficiency.",
            "Step 4: Assess Consensus": "Quantify the agreement among the generated responses using suitable metrics for each task:\n- Question answering: Exact match and token-level F1 score between the responses.\n- Natural language inference: Percentage of responses with the same predicted label (entailment, contradiction, or neutral).\n- Text classification: Percentage of responses with the same predicted class.\nCalculate the average consensus score across the generated responses for each input.",
            "Step 5: Calibrate Confidence": "Map the consensus scores to calibrated confidence estimates. Experiment with different mapping functions:\n- Linear mapping: Normalize the consensus scores to the range [0, 1] and use them directly as confidence estimates.\n- Threshold-based mapping: Set a threshold (e.g., 0.7) and assign high confidence to inputs with consensus scores above the threshold, and low confidence otherwise.\n- Learned mapping: Train a small calibration model (e.g., logistic regression) to predict the probability of correctness based on the consensus scores, using a held-out validation set.",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Calibration": "Compare the calibration performance of CCP against baseline methods (temperature scaling, ensembling, post-hoc calibration) using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). Lower ECE and MCE values indicate better calibration.\nAdditionally, assess the accuracy-confidence correlation by plotting accuracy vs. confidence curves. Well-calibrated models should exhibit a strong positive correlation between accuracy and confidence.",
            "Step 7: Analyze Efficiency": "Measure the computational overhead of CCP compared to the baselines. Report the average inference time per input and the total computational cost (e.g., FLOPs) for each method. Discuss the trade-offs between calibration performance and computational efficiency."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Question Answering": {
                "Test Case Input": "When was the Declaration of Independence signed?",
                "Baseline Output": "The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "CCP Output": "Response 1: The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776.\nResponse 2: The Declaration of Independence was formally adopted on July 4, 1776, but the actual signing took place on August 2, 1776.\nResponse 3: The Declaration of Independence was signed by most of the delegates on August 2, 1776, although the formal adoption took place on July 4, 1776.\nConsensus Score: 0.67\nCalibrated Confidence: 0.75",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method assigns high confidence to the output, even though it is partially incorrect. CCP generates multiple responses, revealing some disagreement about the exact signing date. The calibrated confidence is lower, reflecting the uncertainty in the responses."
            },
            "Natural Language Inference": {
                "Test Case Input": "Premise: A group of people are sitting in a circle on the grass.\nHypothesis: The people are having a picnic.",
                "Baseline Output": "Entailment (Confidence: 0.85)",
                "CCP Output": "Response 1: Neutral\nResponse 2: Neutral\nResponse 3: Entailment\nResponse 4: Neutral\nResponse 5: Neutral\nConsensus Score: 0.8 (Neutral)\nCalibrated Confidence: 0.7",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method incorrectly predicts entailment with high confidence. CCP generates multiple responses, with the majority agreeing on the 'neutral' label. The calibrated confidence is lower, aligning with the uncertainty in the hypothesis given the premise."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCP method does not significantly improve calibration performance compared to the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality and diversity of the generated responses. If the responses lack sufficient diversity or fail to capture different perspectives, explore alternative prompting techniques or diversity-promoting objectives during generation.\n2. Investigate the relationship between the number of generated responses and calibration performance. Increase the number of responses per input to see if it leads to better consensus assessment and calibration.\n3. Experiment with different consensus assessment metrics or combine multiple metrics to better capture the agreement among the responses. Consider using more advanced natural language processing techniques, such as semantic similarity measures or clustering algorithms.\n4. Explore alternative calibration methods, such as Bayesian calibration or isotonic regression, to map the consensus scores to well-calibrated confidence estimates.\n5. Conduct a thorough error analysis to identify the types of inputs or tasks where CCP struggles the most. Use these insights to refine the prompting strategies or develop task-specific calibration approaches.\nIf the proposed method still fails to yield satisfactory results after exploring these alternatives, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of consensus-based calibration in LLMs. Investigate the factors that contribute to overconfidence or poor calibration, such as dataset biases, model architectures, or training objectives. Use these findings to propose new research directions or provide guidance for future work on confidence calibration in LLMs."
