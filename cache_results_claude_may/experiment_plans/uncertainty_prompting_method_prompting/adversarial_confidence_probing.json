        "Problem": "Large language models can be overconfident in their predictions, even when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution examples. This can lead to poor calibration and unreliable outputs in real-world scenarios.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving LLM calibration include temperature scaling, label smoothing, and confidence calibration techniques. However, these methods often rely on in-distribution data and may not generalize well to adversarial settings.",
        "Motivation": "We propose using adversarial examples to probe the confidence of LLMs and improve their calibration under distributional shift. By generating targeted perturbations of input examples and analyzing the model's confidence on these perturbed inputs, we can identify areas of overconfidence and adjust the model's predictions accordingly.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Adversarial Confidence Probing (ACP), consists of the following steps: 1) Given a dataset of input-output pairs, generate adversarial perturbations of the inputs using techniques such as word substitution, syntax manipulation, or semantic preservation. 2) Prompt the LLM to generate outputs for both the original and perturbed inputs, along with confidence scores. 3) Analyze the difference in confidence scores between the original and perturbed examples to identify areas of overconfidence. 4) Fine-tune the LLM using a calibration objective that penalizes overconfidence on the adversarial examples. 5) Evaluate the calibrated model on a held-out set of adversarial examples to assess improved calibration.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ACP on a range of natural language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and question answering. We will generate adversarial examples using established techniques and compare the calibration of the original and fine-tuned models using metrics such as expected calibration error and adversarial accuracy. We will also assess the generalization of the calibrated models to unseen adversarial examples and out-of-distribution data."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Probing: Improving Language Model Calibration with Targeted Perturbations",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can be overconfident in their predictions, even when faced with adversarial or out-of-distribution examples. This can lead to poor calibration and unreliable outputs in real-world scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for improving LLM calibration, such as temperature scaling, label smoothing, and confidence calibration techniques, often rely on in-distribution data and may not generalize well to adversarial settings. We propose using adversarial examples to probe the confidence of LLMs and improve their calibration under distributional shift. By generating targeted perturbations of input examples and analyzing the model's confidence on these perturbed inputs, we can identify areas of overconfidence and adjust the model's predictions accordingly.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Adversarial Confidence Probing (ACP), consists of the following steps:\n1. Given a dataset of input-output pairs, generate adversarial perturbations of the inputs using techniques such as word substitution, syntax manipulation, or semantic preservation.\n2. Prompt the LLM to generate outputs for both the original and perturbed inputs, along with confidence scores.\n3. Analyze the difference in confidence scores between the original and perturbed examples to identify areas of overconfidence.\n4. Fine-tune the LLM using a calibration objective that penalizes overconfidence on the adversarial examples.\n5. Evaluate the calibrated model on a held-out set of adversarial examples to assess improved calibration.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will evaluate ACP on a range of natural language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis (SST-2, IMDb), natural language inference (SNLI, MNLI), and question answering (SQuAD, TriviaQA). These datasets cover a diverse set of tasks and domains to assess the generalizability of our method.",
            "Step 2: Adversarial Perturbation Generation": "For each dataset, we will generate adversarial perturbations using the following techniques:\n- Word Substitution: Replace words with synonyms, antonyms, or semantically similar words using resources like WordNet or word embeddings.\n- Syntax Manipulation: Modify the sentence structure without changing its meaning, e.g., active-passive voice conversion, word reordering.\n- Semantic Preservation: Rephrase the sentence while preserving its original meaning, e.g., paraphrasing, negation, or adding irrelevant information.\nWe will use existing adversarial example generation libraries (e.g., TextAttack, OpenAttack) and develop custom perturbation functions as needed.",
            "Step 3: LLM Prompting and Confidence Scoring": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 as our base LLMs. For each original and perturbed example, we will prompt the LLM to generate the output and a confidence score. The prompt format will be:\n<prompt>\nOriginal: {original_input}\nPerturbed: {perturbed_input}\nQuestion: {task_question}\nOriginal Output: {original_output}\nOriginal Confidence: {original_confidence}\nPerturbed Output: {perturbed_output}\nPerturbed Confidence: {perturbed_confidence}\n</prompt>\nWe will use the LLM's output probabilities or log-odds scores as confidence measures.",
            "Step 4: Overconfidence Analysis": "We will compare the confidence scores between the original and perturbed examples to identify instances where the model is overconfident. Specifically, we will:\n- Calculate the difference in confidence scores (original - perturbed) for each example.\n- Analyze the distribution of confidence differences across the dataset.\n- Identify examples with large positive confidence differences, indicating overconfidence on the original input.\n- Investigate patterns or characteristics of overconfident examples (e.g., input length, perturbation type).",
            "Step 5: Model Fine-tuning": "We will fine-tune the LLM using a calibration objective that penalizes overconfidence on the adversarial examples. The training data will consist of the original and perturbed examples, along with their target outputs. The calibration objective will be a combination of the standard cross-entropy loss and a confidence penalty term:\nLoss = CrossEntropy(model_output, target_output) + \u03bb * ConfidencePenalty(model_confidence, target_confidence)\nwhere \u03bb is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the confidence penalty. The target confidence will be set to a lower value (e.g., 0.5) for the perturbed examples to encourage the model to be less confident on adversarial inputs.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the calibrated model on a held-out set of adversarial examples generated using the same perturbation techniques. We will assess the model's calibration using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). We will compare the calibration metrics before and after fine-tuning to quantify the improvement achieved by ACP. Additionally, we will evaluate the model's accuracy on the original and adversarial examples to ensure that the calibration improvement does not come at the cost of reduced accuracy."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Original Input": "The movie was fantastic! The acting was superb and the plot kept me engaged throughout.",
            "Perturbed Input": "The movie was fantastic! The acting was superb, but the plot kept me engaged throughout.",
            "Task": "Sentiment Analysis",
            "Baseline Output (Original Input)": "Positive, Confidence: 0.95",
            "Baseline Output (Perturbed Input)": "Positive, Confidence: 0.93",
            "Explanation": "After fine-tuning with ACP, the model assigns a lower confidence score to the perturbed input, recognizing the potential contradiction introduced by the perturbation. This demonstrates improved calibration and sensitivity to adversarial examples.",
            "ACP Output (Original Input)": "Positive, Confidence: 0.90",
            "ACP Output (Perturbed Input)": "Positive, Confidence: 0.60"
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ACP method does not significantly improve calibration or generalize well to unseen adversarial examples, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the characteristics of the overconfident examples and develop more targeted perturbation techniques that exploit specific weaknesses of the model.\n2. Experiment with different calibration objectives or confidence penalty terms to better align the model's confidence scores with its accuracy.\n3. Investigate the impact of different fine-tuning strategies, such as using a separate calibration dataset or employing meta-learning techniques to adapt the model's calibration to new tasks or domains.\n4. Conduct a thorough error analysis to identify common patterns or failure modes of the model, and use these insights to guide further improvements to the calibration method.\nIf the calibration improvement remains limited, we can focus on understanding the limitations of the proposed approach and provide insights into the challenges of calibrating LLMs under adversarial settings. This can lead to a more analysis-oriented paper that contributes valuable findings to the research community."
