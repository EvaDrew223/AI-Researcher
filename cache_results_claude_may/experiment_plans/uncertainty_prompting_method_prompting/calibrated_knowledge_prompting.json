    "idea_name": "Calibrated Knowledge Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models can generate factually incorrect or inconsistent responses when prompted with questions that require external knowledge. This is partly due to the model's inability to accurately assess its own knowledge and uncertainty about a given topic.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving the factual accuracy of LLMs include retrieval-augmented generation, where the model is provided with relevant external knowledge, and knowledge distillation, where the model is fine-tuned on a curated dataset of factual information. However, these methods do not explicitly calibrate the model's confidence in its knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a calibrated knowledge prompting approach, where the LLM is prompted to assess its own knowledge and uncertainty about a given topic before generating a response. By conditioning the response generation on the model's self-assessed knowledge level, we can improve the factual accuracy and consistency of the generated outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Calibrated Knowledge Prompting (CKP), consists of the following steps: 1) Given an input question, prompt the LLM to assess its own knowledge level about the relevant topics using a predefined scale (e.g., high, medium, low). 2) If the knowledge level is assessed as high, prompt the LLM to generate a response directly based on its internal knowledge. 3) If the knowledge level is assessed as medium or low, prompt the LLM to search for relevant external knowledge using a retrieval system and incorporate it into the response generation. 4) Prompt the LLM to generate a confidence score for the final response based on the assessed knowledge level and the retrieved external knowledge. 5) If the confidence score is below a threshold, prompt the LLM to indicate its uncertainty or lack of knowledge in the response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CKP on a range of knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks, such as open-domain QA, fact checking, and trivia. We will compare the factual accuracy and consistency of the generated responses against baselines such as direct prompting and retrieval-augmented generation. Metrics will include accuracy, F1 score, and consistency with external knowledge sources. We will also conduct human evaluations to assess the quality and trustworthiness of the generated responses."

We propose a calibrated knowledge prompting approach, where the LLM is prompted to assess its own knowledge and uncertainty about a given topic before generating a response. By conditioning the response generation on the model's self-assessed knowledge level, we aim to improve the factual accuracy and consistency of the generated outputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "Calibrated Knowledge Prompting (CKP) consists of the following steps:\n1. Given an input question, prompt the LLM to assess its own knowledge level about the relevant topics using a predefined scale (e.g., high, medium, low).\n2. If the knowledge level is assessed as high, prompt the LLM to generate a response directly based on its internal knowledge.\n3.

If the confidence score is below a threshold, prompt the LLM to indicate its uncertainty or lack of knowledge in the response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate CKP on a range of knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks, such as open-domain QA (Natural Questions, TriviaQA), fact checking (FEVER), and trivia (QuizBowl). Use accuracy, F1 score, and consistency with external knowledge sources as metrics.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Baseline prompt: Directly ask the question without any additional instructions.\n2. Knowledge assessment prompt: Append the following instruction to the question: \"Before answering, assess your knowledge level about the relevant topics on a scale of high, medium, or low.\"\n3. High knowledge prompt: If the knowledge level is assessed as high, append: \"Based on your internal knowledge, provide a detailed answer to the question.\"\n4. Medium/low knowledge prompt: If the knowledge level is assessed as medium or low, append: \"Search for relevant information from the provided external knowledge sources and incorporate it into your answer.\"\n5. Confidence score prompt: After generating the response, append: \"Based on your assessed knowledge level and the retrieved external knowledge, provide a confidence score for your answer on a scale of 0 to 1.\"\n6. Uncertainty prompt: If the confidence score is below a threshold (e.g., 0.5), append: \"I'm not confident in my answer due to limited knowledge about this topic.\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate CKP on GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and an open-source model like BLOOM or GPT-J.",
            "Step 4: Implement Knowledge Retrieval": "Use a retrieval system (e.g., ElasticSearch, BM25) to search for relevant external knowledge from sources like Wikipedia or domain-specific databases. Fine-tune the retrieval system on the chosen datasets to improve the relevance of the retrieved knowledge.",
            "Step 5: Run Experiments": "For each dataset and model combination, generate responses using the baseline prompt and the CKP prompts. Record the accuracy, F1 score, and consistency metrics for each setup.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of CKP against the baseline prompt across different models and datasets. Analyze the impact of knowledge assessment, external knowledge retrieval, and confidence scores on the factual accuracy and consistency of the generated responses. Conduct error analysis to identify common failure modes and potential improvements."

            "Test Case 1": {
                "Question": "Who won the 2020 NBA Championship?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Who won the 2020 NBA Championship?",
                "Baseline Output": "The Los Angeles Lakers won the 2020 NBA Championship.",
                "CKP Prompts": {
                    "Knowledge Assessment": "Who won the 2020 NBA Championship? Before answering, assess your knowledge level about the relevant topics on a scale of high, medium, or low.",
                    "Knowledge Assessment Output": "Knowledge level: High",
                    "High Knowledge": "Who won the 2020 NBA Championship? Based on your internal knowledge, provide a detailed answer to the question.",
                    "High Knowledge Output": "The Los Angeles Lakers won the 2020 NBA Championship. They defeated the Miami Heat in six games, with a final score of 4-2 in the series. The Lakers were led by superstars LeBron James and Anthony Davis, who both had outstanding performances throughout the playoffs. This marked the Lakers' 17th championship title, tying them with the Boston Celtics for the most in NBA history. The championship was particularly meaningful for the Lakers organization and fans, as it came in the same year that the team's legendary former player Kobe Bryant tragically passed away.",
                    "Confidence Score": "Based on your assessed knowledge level and the retrieved external knowledge, provide a confidence score for your answer on a scale of 0 to 1.",
                    "Confidence Score Output": "Confidence score: 0.95"
                },
                "Explanation": "In this example, the model assesses its knowledge level about the 2020 NBA Championship as high. Based on its internal knowledge, it provides a detailed and accurate answer, including the winning team, the series score, key players, and the significance of the championship for the Lakers organization. The model also generates a high confidence score, indicating its certainty in the answer."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Question": "What is the capital of Azerbaijan?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "What is the capital of Azerbaijan?",
                "Baseline Output": "The capital of Azerbaijan is Baku.",
                "CKP Prompts": {
                    "Knowledge Assessment": "What is the capital of Azerbaijan? Before answering, assess your knowledge level about the relevant topics on a scale of high, medium, or low.",
                    "Knowledge Assessment Output": "Knowledge level: Low",
                    "Medium/Low Knowledge": "What is the capital of Azerbaijan? Search for relevant information from the provided external knowledge sources and incorporate it into your answer.",
                    "Medium/Low Knowledge Output": "According to Wikipedia, the capital of Azerbaijan is Baku. Baku is the largest city in Azerbaijan and the Caucasus region, located on the Caspian Sea coast. It is also the financial, industrial, and cultural center of Azerbaijan.",
                    "Confidence Score": "Based on your assessed knowledge level and the retrieved external knowledge, provide a confidence score for your answer on a scale of 0 to 1.",
                    "Confidence Score Output": "Confidence score: 0.8",
                    "Uncertainty Prompt": "I'm not entirely confident in my answer due to limited knowledge about this topic. The information provided is based on a quick search of external sources."
                },
                "Explanation": "In this example, the model assesses its knowledge level about the capital of Azerbaijan as low. It then searches for relevant information from external knowledge sources (in this case, Wikipedia) and incorporates it into the answer. Although the answer is correct, the model generates a lower confidence score and expresses some uncertainty due to its limited internal knowledge about the topic."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CKP method does not significantly improve the factual accuracy and consistency of the generated responses compared to the baseline, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the knowledge assessment step to determine if the model is accurately gauging its own knowledge level. If not, explore alternative prompts or techniques for self-assessment, such as using more granular scales or providing examples of knowledge levels.\n2. Evaluate the quality and relevance of the retrieved external knowledge. If the retrieved information is not sufficiently relevant or accurate, fine-tune the retrieval system on a larger dataset or experiment with different retrieval techniques (e.g., semantic search, query expansion).\n3. Investigate the impact of different confidence score thresholds on the model's performance. Adjust the threshold based on the specific requirements of the task and the desired trade-off between accuracy and coverage.\n4. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify common patterns in the model's failures. Use these insights to refine the prompts, improve the external knowledge retrieval, or explore alternative approaches, such as combining CKP with other techniques like retrieval-augmented generation or knowledge distillation.\n5. If the CKP method does not yield significant improvements, focus on analyzing the reasons behind its limitations and present the findings as an analysis paper. The insights gained from this study can inform future research on improving the factual accuracy and consistency of large language models."
