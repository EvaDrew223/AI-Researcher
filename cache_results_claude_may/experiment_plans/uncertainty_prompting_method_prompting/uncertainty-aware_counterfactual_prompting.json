    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to generate consistent and coherent counterfactual responses, especially when dealing with uncertain or ambiguous contexts. This limits their applicability in scenarios such as creative writing, policy analysis, and decision support.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for generating counterfactual responses with LLMs include using structured prompts, fine-tuning on counterfactual datasets, and incorporating causal reasoning frameworks. However, these methods often rely on deterministic outcomes and do not explicitly model the uncertainty in the counterfactual scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "We propose an uncertainty-aware counterfactual prompting approach, where the LLM is prompted to generate multiple possible counterfactual scenarios and their associated likelihoods based on the uncertainty in the context. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty and generating a distribution over possible outcomes, we can improve the coherence and robustness of the counterfactual responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Uncertainty-Aware Counterfactual Prompting (UACP), consists of the following steps: 1) Given an input context and a counterfactual query, prompt the LLM to identify the uncertain or ambiguous aspects of the context that are relevant to the query. 2) For each uncertain aspect, prompt the LLM to generate multiple possible counterfactual scenarios and their associated likelihoods based on the degree of uncertainty. 3) Prompt the LLM to generate a response for each counterfactual scenario, taking into account the likelihood of that scenario. 4) Aggregate the generated responses based on their likelihoods to produce a final counterfactual response that captures the uncertainty in the context. 5) Prompt the LLM to generate an explanation of the uncertainty and its impact on the counterfactual response.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UACP on a range of counterfactual reasoning tasks, such as story generation, policy analysis, and decision support. We will compare the coherence, diversity, and robustness of the generated counterfactual responses against baselines such as deterministic counterfactual prompting and fine-tuning on counterfactual datasets. Metrics will include measures of coherence, diversity, and consistency with the input context. We will also conduct human evaluations to assess the quality and usefulness of the uncertainty-aware counterfactual responses in different application scenarios."

        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to generate consistent and coherent counterfactual responses, especially when dealing with uncertain or ambiguous contexts. This limits their applicability in scenarios such as creative writing, policy analysis, and decision support.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for generating counterfactual responses with LLMs, such as using structured prompts, fine-tuning on counterfactual datasets, and incorporating causal reasoning frameworks, often rely on deterministic outcomes and do not explicitly model the uncertainty in the counterfactual scenarios. Inspired by human reasoning, where uncertainty is explicitly considered and multiple possible outcomes are weighed based on their likelihoods, we propose an uncertainty-aware counterfactual prompting approach. By prompting the LLM to generate multiple possible counterfactual scenarios and their associated likelihoods based on the uncertainty in the context, we aim to improve the coherence and robustness of the counterfactual responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Uncertainty-Aware Counterfactual Prompting (UACP), consists of the following steps:\n1. Given an input context and a counterfactual query, prompt the LLM to identify the uncertain or ambiguous aspects of the context that are relevant to the query.\n2. For each uncertain aspect, prompt the LLM to generate multiple possible counterfactual scenarios and their associated likelihoods based on the degree of uncertainty.\n3. Prompt the LLM to generate a response for each counterfactual scenario, taking into account the likelihood of that scenario.\n4. Aggregate the generated responses based on their likelihoods to produce a final counterfactual response that captures the uncertainty in the context.\n5. Prompt the LLM to generate an explanation of the uncertainty and its impact on the counterfactual response.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate UACP on a range of counterfactual reasoning tasks, such as story generation (WritingPrompts dataset), policy analysis (synthetic dataset with policy scenarios), and decision support (synthetic dataset with decision-making scenarios). For each dataset, we will create a subset of examples that involve uncertain or ambiguous contexts.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Baseline prompts: a) Direct prompting: Provide the input context and counterfactual query directly to the LLM. b) Structured prompting: Use templates to guide the LLM in generating counterfactual responses, e.g., \"Given [context], what would happen if [counterfactual query]?\"\n2. UACP prompts: a) Uncertainty identification: \"Given [context] and [counterfactual query], what are the uncertain or ambiguous aspects of the context that are relevant to the query?\" b) Counterfactual scenario generation: \"For [uncertain aspect], generate [N] possible counterfactual scenarios and their associated likelihoods based on the degree of uncertainty.\" c) Response generation: \"For [counterfactual scenario], generate a response taking into account its likelihood of [likelihood].\" d) Response aggregation: \"Aggregate the following responses based on their likelihoods: [generated responses].\" e) Explanation generation: \"Explain how the uncertainty in the context impacts the counterfactual response.\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each dataset and model combination, we will generate counterfactual responses using the baseline prompts and UACP prompts. We will evaluate the generated responses using both automatic metrics (e.g., coherence score, diversity score) and human evaluation (e.g., coherence, consistency, robustness to uncertainty).",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will compare the performance of UACP against the baselines in terms of the coherence, diversity, and robustness of the generated counterfactual responses. We will also analyze the impact of the number of counterfactual scenarios generated (N) and the quality of the uncertainty identification and explanation steps on the overall performance of UACP."

                "Baseline Output (Direct)": "If the startup manages to secure a major client, it would likely see a significant increase in revenue and growth. This could help the startup attract more investors and expand its operations. However, without a clear business plan, the startup may struggle to sustain this growth in the long term.",

                "UACP Output (Counterfactual Scenario Generation)": "Scenario 1 (60% likelihood): The startup successfully executes its idea and delivers significant value to the major client, leading to a long-term partnership and stable revenue stream.\nScenario 2 (30% likelihood): The startup faces challenges in executing its idea and delivers only partial value to the major client, leading to a short-term contract and limited revenue growth.\nScenario 3 (10% likelihood): The startup fails to execute its idea and delivers no value to the major client, leading to contract termination and reputational damage.",

However, there is a 30% chance that the startup will face challenges in delivering value, resulting in limited revenue growth, and a 10% chance of failing to deliver any value, leading to contract termination and reputational damage. The startup's success depends heavily on its ability to execute its idea and deliver value to the client. John should carefully consider these uncertainties before making his investment decision.",

                "UACP Output (Explanation Generation)": "The uncertainty in the context, particularly regarding the startup's ability to execute its idea and deliver value to the major client, significantly impacts the counterfactual response. The likelihood of the startup's success varies based on how well it can handle this uncertainty. If the startup can successfully navigate this challenge, it has a higher chance of securing a long-term partnership and stable revenue. However, if it fails to do so, it may face limited growth or even contract termination. This uncertainty makes the investment decision more complex and risky for John, as the startup's success is not guaranteed even if it manages to secure a major client."

However, the effectiveness of the marketing campaign would depend on various factors, such as the quality of the messaging, the target audience, and the public's perception of the new system.

The effectiveness of the marketing campaign in increasing adoption rates depends on how the public perceives the system. If the public has a positive perception, the marketing campaign is more likely to succeed in encouraging high adoption rates. However, if the public has mixed opinions or a negative perception, the marketing campaign may have a limited impact on adoption rates. This uncertainty makes it challenging for the city to predict the outcome of its investment in the marketing campaign and the overall success of the public transportation system. The city must carefully consider the potential scenarios and allocate its limited resources in a way that maximizes the chances of success while minimizing the risks associated with the uncertainty in public perception."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UACP method does not outperform the baselines, we can conduct additional analyses to identify the reasons behind its underperformance. Some potential areas to investigate include:\n1. Quality of uncertainty identification: Analyze the generated uncertainty aspects to determine if they accurately capture the relevant uncertainties in the context. If the uncertainty identification step is not performing well, it could lead to less coherent and robust counterfactual responses.\n2. Quality of counterfactual scenario generation: Analyze the generated counterfactual scenarios and their associated likelihoods to determine if they are plausible and cover a diverse range of possible outcomes. If the scenarios are not diverse or plausible enough, it could limit the effectiveness of the UACP method.\n3. Impact of the number of counterfactual scenarios: Experiment with different values of N (the number of counterfactual scenarios generated) to determine if increasing or decreasing N affects the performance of UACP. There may be an optimal range of N that balances the diversity and coherence of the generated responses.\n4. Quality of response aggregation: Analyze the aggregated responses to determine if they effectively combine the information from the individual counterfactual scenarios. If the aggregation step is not performing well, it could lead to less coherent and robust final responses.\n5. Impact of the selected language models: Experiment with different language models (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4) to determine if the choice of model affects the performance of UACP. Some models may be better suited for handling uncertainty and generating coherent counterfactual responses than others.\nBased on the findings from these additional analyses, we can propose modifications to the UACP method or develop alternative approaches that address the identified limitations. For example, if the uncertainty identification step is found to be a key bottleneck, we could explore alternative prompting strategies or incorporate external knowledge sources to improve the accuracy and relevance of the identified uncertainties.\nIf the UACP method and its variations still do not yield satisfactory results, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the challenges and limitations of generating coherent and robust counterfactual responses using large language models. This could involve conducting a more in-depth error analysis of the generated responses, comparing the performance of different language models and prompting strategies, and exploring the trade-offs between diversity and coherence in counterfactual reasoning. The insights gained from this analysis could inform future research directions and the development of more effective methods for counterfactual reasoning with large language models."
