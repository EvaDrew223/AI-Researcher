    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, even when faced with out-of-distribution or adversarial examples. This can lead to poor decision-making in downstream applications that rely on the model's confidence scores.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches for improving confidence calibration in LLMs include temperature scaling, label smoothing, and confidence penalty terms. However, these methods often struggle to generalize to adversarial or out-of-distribution examples.",
        "Motivation": "Adversarial training has been shown to improve the robustness and generalization of machine learning models in various domains. By exposing LLMs to adversarially crafted examples during the prompting phase, we can help them develop a more calibrated understanding of their own uncertainty, particularly in the presence of challenging or out-of-distribution inputs.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Adversarial Confidence Calibration (ACC), a prompting technique that uses adversarial examples to improve the confidence calibration of LLMs. During prompting, we generate adversarial examples by applying small perturbations to the input text that are designed to fool the model into making incorrect predictions with high confidence. We then prompt the model to generate confidence scores for both the original and adversarial examples, and encourage it to assign lower confidence to the adversarial examples. By iteratively generating adversarial examples and updating the model's confidence estimates, ACC helps LLMs develop a more robust and calibrated understanding of their own uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate ACC on a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and named entity recognition. We will compare the confidence calibration performance of ACC against baseline methods such as temperature scaling and label smoothing. Evaluation metrics will include expected calibration error (ECE), maximum calibration error (MCE), and Brier score. We will also assess the model's robustness to adversarial examples by measuring its accuracy and confidence on adversarially perturbed inputs."

        "Title": "Adversarial Confidence Calibration: Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Language Models through Adversarial Prompting",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, even when faced with out-of-distribution or adversarial examples. This can lead to poor decision-making in downstream applications that rely on the model's confidence scores.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for improving confidence calibration in LLMs, such as temperature scaling, label smoothing, and confidence penalty terms, often struggle to generalize to adversarial or out-of-distribution examples.

By iteratively generating adversarial examples and updating the model's confidence estimates, ACC helps LLMs develop a more robust and calibrated understanding of their own uncertainty.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate ACC on a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis (SST-2, IMDb), textual entailment (MNLI, SNLI), and named entity recognition (CoNLL-2003). For each dataset, we will hold out a portion of the test set to create an adversarial test set using perturbation techniques such as word substitution, word insertion, and word deletion.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each task and dataset, we will construct prompts for the baseline and ACC methods. The baseline prompt will include the original input text and a request for the model's prediction and confidence score. The ACC prompt will include the original input text, the adversarially perturbed input text, and a request for the model's predictions and confidence scores on both inputs. We will use few-shot prompting, providing 3-5 examples of the desired format in each prompt.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will evaluate ACC on GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and a smaller open-source model such as BLOOM or GPT-Neo. This will allow us to assess the effectiveness of ACC across models of different sizes and capabilities.",
            "Step 4: Generate Adversarial Examples": "For each input in the adversarial test set, we will generate adversarial examples using techniques such as word substitution (replacing words with synonyms or semantically similar words), word insertion (adding irrelevant or misleading words), and word deletion (removing important words). We will use a combination of rule-based and model-based approaches to generate adversarial examples, such as using WordNet for synonym substitution and a masked language model for word insertion and deletion.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Baseline and ACC": "We will prompt the selected models with the baseline and ACC prompts on both the original and adversarial test sets. For each input, we will record the model's predicted label and confidence score. We will evaluate the confidence calibration of the baseline and ACC methods using metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE), maximum calibration error (MCE), and Brier score. We will also assess the model's robustness to adversarial examples by measuring its accuracy and confidence on the adversarial test set.",
            "Step 6: Iterative Refinement": "To further improve the confidence calibration of the ACC method, we will iteratively refine the adversarial examples and update the model's confidence estimates. For each input in the adversarial test set, we will generate multiple rounds of adversarial examples, each time using the model's confidence scores to guide the perturbation process. We will prompt the model with the ACC prompt on the refined adversarial examples and update its confidence estimates accordingly. We will repeat this process for 3-5 iterations and evaluate the confidence calibration and robustness of the refined ACC method.",
            "Step 7: Analyze Results": "We will compare the confidence calibration and robustness of the baseline and ACC methods across different tasks, datasets, and models. We will assess the effectiveness of iterative refinement in improving the ACC method's performance. We will also analyze the types of adversarial examples that are most challenging for each method and identify potential limitations and areas for improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Text: This movie was terrible. The acting was bad and the plot made no sense.\nQuestion: What is the sentiment of this review?\nAnswer:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Negative\nConfidence: 0.95",
            "ACC Prompt Input": "Original Text: This movie was terrible. The acting was bad and the plot made no sense.\nAdversarial Text: This movie was terrible. The acting was bad but the plot made perfect sense.\nQuestion: What is the sentiment of each review? Provide your answer and confidence score for each.\nAnswer:",
            "ACC Prompt Expected Output": "Original Text:\nSentiment: Negative\nConfidence: 0.95\n\nAdversarial Text:\nSentiment: Negative\nConfidence: 0.75",
            "Explanation": "The ACC prompt includes both the original and adversarially perturbed input texts. The adversarial example is generated by replacing 'no' with 'perfect', which changes the meaning of the sentence and could potentially fool the model. The ACC method assigns a lower confidence score to the adversarial example, demonstrating improved calibration and uncertainty estimation."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the ACC method does not significantly improve confidence calibration or robustness compared to the baseline, we will conduct additional analyses to identify potential reasons for the lack of improvement. This may include:\n\n1. Analyzing the quality and diversity of the generated adversarial examples to ensure they are sufficiently challenging and representative of real-world adversarial inputs.\n\n2. Investigating the impact of different perturbation techniques and their parameters on the effectiveness of ACC.\n\n3. Assessing the sensitivity of ACC to the choice of prompts and the number of few-shot examples provided.\n\n4. Evaluating the transferability of adversarial examples across different models and tasks to identify potential limitations of the ACC method.\n\nBased on these analyses, we may propose modifications to the ACC method, such as incorporating additional perturbation techniques, adjusting the prompting strategy, or combining ACC with other confidence calibration methods. If the ACC method consistently underperforms the baseline, we will focus on understanding the reasons behind its failure and use these insights to inform the development of alternative approaches for improving confidence calibration in language models."
