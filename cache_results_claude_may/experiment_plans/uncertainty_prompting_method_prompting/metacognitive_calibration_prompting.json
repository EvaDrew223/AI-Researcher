        "Problem": "LLMs often lack explicit metacognitive skills to assess and calibrate their own uncertainty, leading to overconfident or underconfident predictions across different contexts.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for improving metacognitive skills in LLMs include explicitly training models to generate explanations or chains of thought, as well as using meta-prompts to encourage reflective reasoning. However, these methods often rely on task-specific annotations or heuristics and may not generalize well to new domains.",
        "Motivation": "By designing prompts that explicitly elicit metacognitive reasoning and self-assessment from LLMs, we can encourage the models to develop more robust and generalizable uncertainty calibration skills. Metacognitive prompting can also help to make the model's reasoning process more transparent and interpretable.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Metacognitive Calibration Prompting (MCP), a prompting method that explicitly elicits metacognitive reasoning and self-assessment from LLMs to improve uncertainty calibration. The key steps are: 1) Given an input query, generate a set of metacognitive prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its own knowledge and reasoning process (e.g., \"What are the key factors influencing your confidence in this answer?\"). 2) Prompt the model to generate a chain of thought that walks through its reasoning process and highlights any sources of uncertainty or confusion. 3) Based on the generated chain of thought, prompt the model to provide a calibrated uncertainty estimate and a justification for its level of confidence. 4) Fine-tune the metacognitive prompts based on the model's calibration performance and the quality of its explanations.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MCP on benchmark datasets for tasks that require metacognitive reasoning, such as self-awareness probes, introspective reports, and confidence calibration. Compare against baseline prompting methods that do not explicitly elicit metacognition. Metrics include calibration error, explanation quality (as judged by human raters), and generalization to new domains or tasks."

The key steps are:\n1. Given an input query, generate a set of metacognitive prompts that encourage the model to reflect on its own knowledge and reasoning process (e.g., \"What are the key factors influencing your confidence in this answer?\").\n2.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We evaluate MCP on benchmark datasets for tasks that require metacognitive reasoning, such as self-awareness probes, introspective reports, and confidence calibration. Specific datasets include: 1) Uncertainty Quantification Datasets: UCI datasets, Shifts Challenge datasets, CIFAR-10H, ImageNet-A. 2) Metacognition Datasets: SELF dataset, Theory of Mind dataset. 3) Reasoning Datasets: bAbI, CLUTRR, ProofWriter, EntailmentBank.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Zero-shot Baseline: Directly ask the question without any additional prompting.\n2. Chain-of-Thought Baseline: Append \"Let's think step by step:\" to the question.\n3. MCP (Ours): a) Metacognitive Prompt Generation: Generate 3-5 metacognitive prompts for each question, e.g., \"What are the key assumptions you're making in your reasoning?\", \"How confident are you in your answer and why?\", \"What additional information would help increase your confidence?\"\nb) Chain-of-Thought Generation: Prompt the model with \"Let's think through this step-by-step while considering the factors influencing your reasoning:\"\nc) Uncertainty Estimation: Prompt the model with \"Based on your reasoning, provide a calibrated estimate of your confidence level (0-100%) and justify it:\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We experiment with GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and Claude models via their respective APIs.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each dataset and model combination, generate predictions using the baseline prompts and MCP. For MCP, record the generated metacognitive prompts, chains of thought, uncertainty estimates, and final predictions.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "1. Compute calibration metrics (e.g., Brier score, ECE, MCE, NLL) to assess the uncertainty estimation quality of MCP vs. baselines.\n2. Qualitatively analyze the generated metacognitive prompts and chains of thought to understand the types of reasoning elicited.\n3. Conduct human evaluation on a subset of examples to assess the quality and interpretability of the uncertainty explanations.\n4. Perform ablations to understand the contribution of each MCP component (metacognitive prompts, chain of thought, uncertainty estimation).\n5. Analyze cross-dataset and cross-model generalization of MCP's calibration improvements."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct)": "Based on the image, what is the most likely breed of the dog? [Image of a Samoyed dog in snow]",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct)": "The dog in the image appears to be a Samoyed.",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (CoT)": "Based on the image, what is the most likely breed of the dog? Let's think step by step: [Image of a Samoyed dog in snow]",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (CoT)": "Let's analyze the image step by step:\n1. The dog has a thick, white, fluffy coat that looks well-suited for cold weather.\n2. The dog's face has a fox-like appearance with pointed ears and a slightly curved tail.\n3. The dog is standing in snow, which suggests it is a breed that can tolerate cold climates.\nConsidering these characteristics, the dog most likely appears to be a Samoyed. Samoyeds are a breed known for their thick, white, double coats, fox-like faces, and adaptability to cold environments.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (MCP)": "Based on the image, what is the most likely breed of the dog? [Image of a Samoyed dog in snow]\n\nMetacognitive Prompts:\n1. What key features of the dog are you using to determine its breed?\n2. How confident are you in your breed identification and why?\n3. What other breeds might be confused with your predicted breed?\n\nLet's think through this step-by-step while considering the factors influencing your reasoning:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (MCP)": "1. The key features I'm using to determine the breed are the thick, white, fluffy coat, the pointed ears, slightly curved tail, and fox-like facial appearance. The fact that the dog is standing in snow also suggests it's a breed adapted to cold climates.\n\n2. I'm reasonably confident (around 80%) in my identification of the dog as a Samoyed. The combination of the physical features and the snowy environment strongly point to a Samoyed. However, I'm not 100% certain as there could be other similar-looking breeds or mixed breeds that I'm less familiar with.\n\n3. Other breeds that might be confused with a Samoyed include the American Eskimo Dog, the White Shepherd, the Japanese Spitz, or possibly a white Pomeranian. These breeds can have similar white, fluffy coats and pointed ears. Seeing additional angles of the dog, its size, or any distinctive markings could help differentiate between these breeds.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I estimate my confidence in the dog being a Samoyed at 80%. The strong match of the physical features and environment to the typical characteristics of a Samoyed support this identification. However, I'm allowing a 20% uncertainty because of the possibility of look-alike breeds or mixes that I may not have considered.",
            "Explanation": "The proposed MCP approach elicits more detailed reasoning from the model about the key features it's using to make the breed identification, its level of confidence, and potential sources of uncertainty or confusion. This results in a more transparent and interpretable prediction compared to the baseline methods. The model's uncertainty estimate is also more calibrated and justified based on its reasoning."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MCP approach does not show significant improvements in calibration metrics over the baselines, we can explore the following fallback options:\n\n1. Analyze the quality and diversity of the generated metacognitive prompts. If the prompts are not effectively eliciting diverse types of metacognitive reasoning, we can curate a set of high-quality prompts based on human expertise and use those instead of the generated ones.\n\n2. Examine the calibration performance across different datasets and models. If MCP works well on some datasets/models but not others, we can investigate the characteristics of the successful cases and adapt the approach accordingly. This can turn into an insightful analysis of the factors influencing metacognitive reasoning in LLMs.\n\n3. Collect human annotations on a subset of the datasets to evaluate the model's metacognitive skills more directly. We can ask human raters to assess the quality of the generated chains of thought, uncertainty estimates, and explanations. This can provide a more fine-grained evaluation of MCP's impact on interpretability and trustworthiness, even if the calibration metrics do not show significant improvements.\n\n4. Explore alternative methods for eliciting metacognitive reasoning, such as using contrastive prompts (e.g., \"How would your reasoning change if X was different?\"), counterfactual prompts (e.g., \"What would make you more confident in your answer?\"), or adversarial prompts (e.g., \"Try to find flaws in your own reasoning.\"). These variations can potentially uncover more effective ways of probing the model's metacognitive skills.\n\nBy pursuing these fallback options, we can still gain valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of improving metacognitive reasoning in LLMs, even if the original MCP approach does not fully succeed. The project can then focus more on the analysis and lessons learned from the different prompting strategies, which can inform future work in this direction."
