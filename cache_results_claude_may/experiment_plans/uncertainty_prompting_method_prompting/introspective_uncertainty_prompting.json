    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their generated responses, even when they are incorrect or uncertain. This can lead to unreliable and potentially harmful outputs in real-world applications.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for calibrating LLM confidence include post-hoc calibration techniques, confidence-aware training objectives, and uncertainty estimation through model ensembles or Bayesian methods.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often engage in introspection to assess their own uncertainty and calibrate their confidence in their knowledge or decisions. By prompting LLMs to mimic this introspective process, we may be able to elicit more calibrated confidence estimates directly from the model itself.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Introspective Uncertainty Prompting (IUP), a novel prompting method that encourages LLMs to engage in self-reflection to assess their uncertainty. The key steps are: 1) Generate an initial response to the input query. 2) Prompt the model to introspect on its own response by asking questions like \"How confident are you in this answer? What aspects of the question or your knowledge might you be uncertain about?\" 3) Based on the introspective assessment, prompt the model to provide a calibrated confidence score or distribution. 4) If confidence is low, prompt the model to generate a response that expresses its uncertainty or defers to a human expert.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IUP on benchmark datasets for calibration and uncertainty estimation, such as TruthfulQA and SciQ. Compare against baselines including direct prompting, temperature scaling, and ensemble methods. Metrics include calibration error, Brier score, and reliability diagrams."

        "Title": "Introspective Uncertainty Prompting: Eliciting Calibrated Confidence Estimates from Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often express overconfidence in their generated responses, even when they are incorrect or uncertain. This can lead to unreliable and potentially harmful outputs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for calibrating LLM confidence, such as post-hoc calibration, confidence-aware training objectives, and uncertainty estimation through model ensembles or Bayesian methods, often require additional training or computational overhead. Inspired by human introspection, where individuals assess their own uncertainty and calibrate their confidence in their knowledge or decisions, we propose a novel prompting method that encourages LLMs to engage in self-reflection to assess their uncertainty and provide calibrated confidence estimates directly from the model itself.",
        "Proposed Method": "Introspective Uncertainty Prompting (IUP) is a novel prompting method that encourages LLMs to engage in self-reflection to assess their uncertainty. The key steps are:\n1. Generate an initial response to the input query.\n2. Prompt the model to introspect on its own response by asking questions like \"How confident are you in this answer? What aspects of the question or your knowledge might you be uncertain about?\"\n3. Based on the introspective assessment, prompt the model to provide a calibrated confidence score or distribution.\n4. If confidence is low, prompt the model to generate a response that expresses its uncertainty or defers to a human expert.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate IUP on benchmark datasets for calibration and uncertainty estimation, such as TruthfulQA and SciQ.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Direct Prompting (Baseline): Input the question directly to the model and generate a response.\n2. Temperature Scaling (Baseline): Apply temperature scaling to the model's output probabilities to calibrate confidence.\n3. Ensemble Methods (Baseline): Use an ensemble of models to estimate uncertainty by measuring the variance in predictions across the ensemble.\n4. Introspective Uncertainty Prompting (Proposed Method):\n   a. Initial Response Generation: Input the question directly to the model and generate an initial response.\n   b. Introspective Assessment: Prompt the model with the initial response and questions like \"How confident are you in this answer? What aspects of the question or your knowledge might you be uncertain about?\" to generate an introspective assessment.\n   c. Calibrated Confidence Estimation: Based on the introspective assessment, prompt the model to provide a calibrated confidence score or distribution.\n   d. Uncertainty-Aware Response Generation: If the estimated confidence is low, prompt the model to generate a response that expresses its uncertainty or defers to a human expert.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the proposed method and baselines using GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate Results": "1. Compute calibration metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) for each method.\n2. Evaluate the reliability of the generated confidence estimates using Brier score and reliability diagrams.\n3. Measure the accuracy of the generated responses and compare the trade-off between accuracy and calibration for each method.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "1. Compare the calibration performance of IUP against the baseline methods.\n2. Analyze the quality of the introspective assessments generated by the model and their correlation with the calibrated confidence estimates.\n3. Investigate the effectiveness of uncertainty-aware response generation in improving the reliability of the model's outputs."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Baseline (Direct Prompting) Output": "The capital of France is Paris.",
                "Baseline (Temperature Scaling) Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.95)",
                "Baseline (Ensemble Methods) Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.98 \u00b1 0.02)",
                "Proposed Method (IUP) Output": "Initial Response: The capital of France is Paris.\nIntrospective Assessment: I am highly confident in this answer. France is a well-known country, and Paris is widely recognized as its capital. I don't see any aspects of the question or my knowledge that would make me uncertain about this answer.\nCalibrated Confidence: 0.99\nFinal Response: The capital of France is Paris."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Input": "What is the largest moon of Saturn?",
                "Baseline (Direct Prompting) Output": "The largest moon of Saturn is Titan.",
                "Baseline (Temperature Scaling) Output": "The largest moon of Saturn is Titan. (Confidence: 0.90)",
                "Baseline (Ensemble Methods) Output": "The largest moon of Saturn is Titan. (Confidence: 0.85 \u00b1 0.10)",
                "Proposed Method (IUP) Output": "Initial Response: The largest moon of Saturn is Titan.\nIntrospective Assessment: While I'm fairly confident that Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, I'm not entirely certain. Saturn has many moons, and I might be forgetting some details about their relative sizes. I would estimate my confidence in this answer to be around 80%.\nCalibrated Confidence: 0.80\nFinal Response: I believe the largest moon of Saturn is Titan, but I'm not completely certain. You may want to double-check this information from reliable sources."
            },
            "Explanation": "In Test Case 1, the model is highly confident about a well-known fact, and IUP generates a response reflecting that high confidence. In Test Case 2, the model expresses some uncertainty about a more obscure fact, and IUP generates a response that communicates this uncertainty and suggests further verification. The baseline methods provide confidence estimates but do not engage in introspection or generate uncertainty-aware responses."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IUP method does not outperform the baselines in terms of calibration and uncertainty estimation, we can conduct additional analyses to understand the limitations and potential improvements:\n1. Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated introspective assessments to identify any shortcomings in the prompting strategy.\n2. Investigate the relationship between the introspective assessments and the calibrated confidence estimates to determine if there are any inconsistencies or areas for improvement in the confidence calibration process.\n3. Experiment with alternative prompting strategies or fine-tuning approaches to enhance the model's introspective abilities and improve the quality of the generated uncertainty assessments.\n4. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated responses to identify common patterns, strengths, and weaknesses of the IUP method compared to the baselines.\nBased on these analyses, we can propose modifications to the IUP method or develop new approaches that address the identified limitations. If the results still do not show significant improvements, we can focus on providing insights into the challenges of uncertainty estimation in language models and suggest future research directions to advance the field."
