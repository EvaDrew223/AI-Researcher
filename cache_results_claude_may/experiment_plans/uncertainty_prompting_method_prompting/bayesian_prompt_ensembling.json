    "idea_name": "Bayesian Prompt Ensembling",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty, especially when dealing with out-of-distribution or ambiguous inputs. This leads to overconfident predictions that may not reflect the model's true uncertainty.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to uncertainty estimation in LLMs include using model ensembles, dropout-based methods, and Bayesian neural networks. However, these methods often require training multiple models or rely on approximations that may not fully capture the model's uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "By using a Bayesian approach to combine the predictions from multiple prompts, we can obtain a more robust and calibrated estimate of the model's uncertainty. This approach is inspired by the success of Bayesian model ensembling in traditional machine learning, where the predictions from multiple models are combined to obtain a more reliable estimate of the predictive uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Bayesian Prompt Ensembling (BPE), a method that generates multiple prompts for a given input and combines their predictions using a Bayesian framework. The prompts are designed to capture different aspects or interpretations of the input, such as rephrasing the question, providing additional context, or asking for clarification. The LLM is then prompted to generate a response for each prompt, along with an associated confidence score. The final prediction is obtained by combining the individual predictions using Bayesian model averaging, where the weights are determined by the confidence scores and the prior probability of each prompt.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate BPE on a range of tasks, including question answering, fact verification, and natural language inference. Compare the calibration and uncertainty estimation of BPE with baseline methods such as model ensembles and dropout-based approaches. Use metrics such as Brier score, expected calibration error, and area under the confidence-accuracy curve to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Analyze the generated prompts and their associated weights to gain insights into the different aspects captured by each prompt."

Inspired by the success of Bayesian model ensembling in traditional machine learning, where the predictions from multiple models are combined to obtain a more reliable estimate of the predictive uncertainty, we propose Bayesian Prompt Ensembling (BPE). By using a Bayesian approach to combine the predictions from multiple prompts, we aim to obtain a more robust and calibrated estimate of the model's uncertainty.",
        "Proposed Method": "Bayesian Prompt Ensembling (BPE) generates multiple prompts for a given input and combines their predictions using a Bayesian framework.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate BPE on a range of tasks, including question answering (SQuAD, TriviaQA), fact verification (FEVER), and natural language inference (SNLI, MNLI). These datasets cover a diverse set of domains and difficulty levels, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each task, design a set of prompts that capture different aspects or interpretations of the input. Examples include:\n- Question Answering: (1) Direct question, (2) Question with additional context, (3) Rephrased question, (4) Question asking for clarification\n- Fact Verification: (1) Direct statement, (2) Statement with additional evidence, (3) Rephrased statement, (4) Statement asking for verification\n- Natural Language Inference: (1) Direct premise and hypothesis, (2) Premise and hypothesis with additional context, (3) Rephrased premise and hypothesis, (4) Premise and hypothesis asking for clarification\nEnsure that the prompts are diverse and cover different aspects of the input while maintaining the core meaning.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Use state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. These models have shown strong performance across various natural language understanding tasks and are suitable for evaluating the proposed method.",
            "Step 4: Implement Bayesian Prompt Ensembling": "For each input, generate predictions using the LLM for each prompt in the set. Obtain the confidence scores associated with each prediction, either by using the model's built-in confidence estimation or by calibrating the scores using a held-out validation set. Combine the predictions using Bayesian model averaging, where the weights are determined by the confidence scores and the prior probability of each prompt. The prior probabilities can be set based on domain knowledge or learned from data.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate and Compare": "Evaluate the performance of BPE against baseline methods, including (1) single prompt prediction, (2) majority voting ensemble, and (3) unweighted averaging ensemble. Use metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and calibration error (e.g., Brier score, expected calibration error) to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Perform statistical significance tests to determine if the improvements are significant.",
            "Step 6: Analyze and Interpret": "Analyze the results to gain insights into the behavior of BPE. Examine the weights assigned to each prompt and their contribution to the final prediction. Investigate the cases where BPE outperforms the baselines and those where it falls short. Interpret the findings in the context of the specific tasks and datasets, and discuss the implications for uncertainty estimation in LLMs."

            "Example 1": {
                "Input": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Prompts": [
                    "What is the capital of France?",
                    "France is a country in Europe. What is its capital city?",
                    "Can you tell me the name of the capital city of France?",
                    "I'm not sure about the capital of France. Could you clarify?"
                ],
                "Baseline Predictions": [
                    "Paris",
                    "Paris",
                    "Paris",
                    "Paris"
                ],
                "Baseline Confidence Scores": [
                    0.9,
                    0.8,
                    0.7,

                "BPE Prediction": "Paris",
                "BPE Confidence Score": 0.95,
                "Explanation": "The baseline methods predict the correct answer 'Paris' for all prompts but with varying confidence scores. BPE combines these predictions using Bayesian model averaging, resulting in a higher confidence score for the correct answer. This demonstrates the effectiveness of BPE in quantifying uncertainty and providing a more calibrated prediction."

            "Example 2": {
                "Input": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
                "Prompts": [
                    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?",
                    "Our solar system consists of eight planets. Which one is the largest?",

                ],
                "Baseline Predictions": [
                    "Jupiter",
                    "Saturn",

                    0.5
                ],
                "BPE Prediction": "Jupiter",
                "BPE Confidence Score": 0.9,
                "Explanation": "The baseline methods predict different answers for the prompts, with 'Jupiter' being the most common prediction. However, the confidence scores for 'Jupiter' are relatively low. BPE combines these predictions and assigns a higher weight to the correct answer 'Jupiter' based on the confidence scores and prior probabilities. This results in a higher confidence score for 'Jupiter' compared to the baseline methods, demonstrating the ability of BPE to handle ambiguous inputs and provide a more accurate estimate of uncertainty."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed BPE method does not significantly outperform the baseline methods, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated prompts and their associated weights to identify potential issues, such as lack of diversity or inadequate coverage of different aspects of the input. Refine the prompt generation process to ensure a more comprehensive set of prompts.\n2. Investigate alternative methods for combining the predictions, such as weighted majority voting or Bayesian model combination with different prior distributions. Compare the performance of these methods with BPE and the baselines.\n3. Explore the impact of using different confidence calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or isotonic regression, on the performance of BPE. Evaluate if improved calibration leads to better uncertainty estimates.\n4. Conduct a thorough error analysis to identify the types of inputs and tasks where BPE struggles. Use this information to guide further improvements in the prompt generation and combination strategies.\n5. Consider incorporating additional information, such as model-specific features or task-specific knowledge, into the Bayesian framework to improve the uncertainty estimates.\nIf the proposed method and the alternative approaches do not yield satisfactory results, the project can be turned into an analysis paper that provides insights into the challenges and limitations of uncertainty estimation in LLMs. The analysis can focus on understanding the factors that contribute to overconfident predictions, the impact of prompt diversity on uncertainty estimates, and the trade-offs between different combination strategies. The findings can inform future research directions and highlight the need for more advanced techniques to accurately quantify uncertainty in LLMs."
