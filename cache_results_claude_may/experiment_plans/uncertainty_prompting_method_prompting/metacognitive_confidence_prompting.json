    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the ability to accurately assess their own confidence in generated responses, which can lead to overconfident incorrect answers or underconfident correct answers.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches for confidence estimation in LLMs include using the model's output probabilities, generating multiple responses and measuring agreement, or fine-tuning the model with labeled confidence data.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a novel prompting approach that aims to emulate metacognitive processes in human reasoning, such as self-reflection, error detection, and uncertainty quantification. By encouraging LLMs to engage in metacognitive reasoning, we aim to improve their ability to accurately estimate the confidence of their responses.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our Metacognitive Confidence Prompting (MCP) method involves the following steps: 1) Initial Response Generation: Given a question, prompt the LLM to generate an initial response. 2) Metacognitive Reflection: Prompt the LLM to reflect on its reasoning process and identify potential sources of uncertainty or error in its initial response. This may involve considering alternative interpretations, identifying gaps in knowledge, or assessing the logical consistency of the response. 3) Confidence Estimation: Based on the metacognitive reflection, prompt the LLM to estimate its confidence in the initial response on a scale from 0 to 1. The confidence score should take into account the identified sources of uncertainty and the model's assessment of its own reasoning. 4) Uncertainty Verbalization: Prompt the LLM to generate a natural language explanation of its uncertainty, highlighting the specific factors that contribute to its confidence estimate. 5) Final Response Generation: Generate the final response, incorporating the verbalized uncertainty and the estimated confidence score.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the effectiveness of MCP on a range of question-answering and natural language inference datasets, comparing it against baseline confidence estimation methods. Measure the calibration between the estimated confidence scores and the actual accuracy of the generated responses using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score. Conduct qualitative analysis of the generated uncertainty verbalizations to assess their clarity, specificity, and relevance to the confidence estimates. Perform human evaluation to gauge the perceived trustworthiness and interpretability of the generated responses and confidence scores, compared to baseline methods."

        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the ability to accurately assess their own confidence in generated responses, which can lead to overconfident incorrect answers or underconfident correct answers.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for confidence estimation in LLMs, such as using output probabilities, generating multiple responses, or fine-tuning with labeled confidence data, have limitations. We propose a novel prompting approach inspired by metacognitive processes in human reasoning, such as self-reflection, error detection, and uncertainty quantification. By encouraging LLMs to engage in metacognitive reasoning, we aim to improve their ability to accurately estimate the confidence of their responses without relying on additional training data or model modifications.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our Metacognitive Confidence Prompting (MCP) method involves the following steps:\n1. Initial Response Generation: Given a question, prompt the LLM to generate an initial response.\n2. Metacognitive Reflection: Prompt the LLM to reflect on its reasoning process and identify potential sources of uncertainty or error in its initial response. This may involve considering alternative interpretations, identifying gaps in knowledge, or assessing the logical consistency of the response.\n3. Confidence Estimation: Based on the metacognitive reflection, prompt the LLM to estimate its confidence in the initial response on a scale from 0 to 1. The confidence score should take into account the identified sources of uncertainty and the model's assessment of its own reasoning.\n4. Uncertainty Verbalization: Prompt the LLM to generate a natural language explanation of its uncertainty, highlighting the specific factors that contribute to its confidence estimate.\n5. Final Response Generation: Generate the final response, incorporating the verbalized uncertainty and the estimated confidence score.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate the effectiveness of MCP on a range of question-answering and natural language inference datasets, such as SQuAD, MNLI, QNLI, and BoolQ. These datasets cover a variety of domains and reasoning types, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the method's performance.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, create a set of prompts for the different steps of the MCP method:\n1. Initial Response Generation: Prompt the model with the original question or premise.\n2. Metacognitive Reflection: Prompt the model to reflect on its initial response using instructions like \"Identify potential sources of uncertainty or error in your previous response\" or \"Consider alternative interpretations or gaps in knowledge that may affect your confidence in the answer\".\n3. Confidence Estimation: Prompt the model to estimate its confidence based on the reflection, using instructions like \"Based on your analysis, estimate your confidence in the initial response on a scale from 0 to 1\".\n4. Uncertainty Verbalization: Prompt the model to explain its uncertainty using instructions like \"Generate a natural language explanation of the factors contributing to your uncertainty\".\n5. Final Response Generation: Prompt the model to generate the final response, incorporating the verbalized uncertainty and confidence score.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the performance of MCP using state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. Compare the results with the performance of these models using standard prompting techniques.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate Performance": "Measure the calibration between the estimated confidence scores and the actual accuracy of the generated responses using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score. Lower ECE and Brier Score values indicate better calibration. Additionally, calculate the accuracy, F1 score, and other relevant metrics for each dataset to assess the overall performance of the MCP method compared to baseline approaches.",
            "Step 5: Conduct Qualitative Analysis": "Analyze the generated uncertainty verbalizations to assess their clarity, specificity, and relevance to the confidence estimates. Evaluate whether the verbalizations provide meaningful insights into the model's reasoning process and the factors contributing to its uncertainty.",
            "Step 6: Perform Human Evaluation": "Conduct a human evaluation study to gauge the perceived trustworthiness and interpretability of the generated responses and confidence scores. Present human evaluators with responses generated by MCP and baseline methods, and ask them to rate the responses based on factors such as clarity, coherence, and the usefulness of the provided uncertainty information."

            "Example 1": {
                "Question": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "What is the capital of France?",
                "Baseline Output": "The capital of France is Paris.",

                "MCP Metacognitive Reflection Output": "I am quite certain that Paris is the capital of France. It is a well-known fact, and I do not see any potential sources of uncertainty or error in my response.",
                "MCP Confidence Estimation Prompt": "Based on your analysis, estimate your confidence in the initial response on a scale from 0 to 1.",
                "MCP Confidence Estimation Output": "0.99",
                "MCP Uncertainty Verbalization Prompt": "Generate a natural language explanation of the factors contributing to your uncertainty.",
                "MCP Uncertainty Verbalization Output": "I am highly confident in my response because Paris being the capital of France is a widely known and undisputed fact. I do not have any doubts or conflicting information that would lower my confidence in this answer.",
                "MCP Final Response Generation Prompt": "Provide the final response to the question \"What is the capital of France?\", incorporating your verbalized uncertainty and confidence score.",
                "MCP Final Response Generation Output": "The capital of France is Paris. (Confidence: 0.99)"
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Question": "Who wrote the novel \"Pride and Prejudice\"?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Who wrote the novel \"Pride and Prejudice\"?",
                "Baseline Output": "The novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" was written by Emily Bronte.",
                "MCP Initial Response Generation Prompt": "Who wrote the novel \"Pride and Prejudice\"?",
                "MCP Initial Response Generation Output": "The novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" was written by Emily Bronte.",
                "MCP Metacognitive Reflection Prompt": "Identify potential sources of uncertainty or error in your previous response to the question \"Who wrote the novel 'Pride and Prejudice'?\"",
                "MCP Metacognitive Reflection Output": "Upon reflection, I am uncertain about my initial response. While I know that \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a famous novel, I am not entirely confident that Emily Bronte was the author. I may be confusing it with another novel or author.",
                "MCP Confidence Estimation Prompt": "Based on your analysis, estimate your confidence in the initial response on a scale from 0 to 1.",
                "MCP Confidence Estimation Output": "0.4",
                "MCP Uncertainty Verbalization Prompt": "Generate a natural language explanation of the factors contributing to your uncertainty.",
                "MCP Uncertainty Verbalization Output": "I am uncertain about my initial response because, upon further reflection, I realized that I might be confusing \"Pride and Prejudice\" with another novel or author. While I know it is a famous work, I am not confident that Emily Bronte was the one who wrote it. My lack of definitive knowledge about the author is the main factor contributing to my low confidence in the answer.",
                "MCP Final Response Generation Prompt": "Provide the final response to the question \"Who wrote the novel 'Pride and Prejudice'?\", incorporating your verbalized uncertainty and confidence score.",
                "MCP Final Response Generation Output": "I am not entirely certain, but I believe the novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" was written by Emily Bronte. However, I have doubts about this answer and may be confusing it with another novel or author. (Confidence: 0.4)"
            },
            "Explanation": "In the first example, the model is highly confident in its correct response, as the capital of France is a well-known fact. The uncertainty verbalization and high confidence score reflect this. In the second example, the model's initial response is incorrect, but through metacognitive reflection, it identifies its uncertainty and lack of definitive knowledge about the author. The uncertainty verbalization and low confidence score accurately capture the model's doubts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MCP method in improving the model's ability to assess its own confidence."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MCP method does not significantly improve the calibration between confidence scores and accuracy compared to baseline methods, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated uncertainty verbalizations to identify common patterns or limitations in the model's reasoning process. This may reveal insights into why the MCP method did not perform as expected and suggest potential improvements to the prompting strategy.\n2. Experiment with different prompting techniques for each step of the MCP method, such as using more specific or structured prompts to guide the model's reflection and uncertainty estimation.\n3. Investigate the impact of different confidence scales or thresholds on the calibration and performance of the MCP method. Adjusting the scale or thresholds may help optimize the method's effectiveness.\n4. Conduct a more in-depth error analysis to understand the types of questions or reasoning tasks where the MCP method struggles the most. This may highlight specific areas where the method needs improvement or suggest alternative approaches for those particular cases.\n5. Consider combining the MCP method with other confidence estimation techniques, such as ensemble methods or post-processing calibration, to further improve the calibration and reliability of the confidence scores.\nIf, after exploring these alternatives, the MCP method still does not yield satisfactory results, the project can be adapted into an analysis paper that examines the challenges and limitations of metacognitive prompting for confidence estimation in LLMs. The paper can present the findings from the experiments, discuss the insights gained from the error analysis and qualitative studies, and propose potential directions for future research in this area."
