    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often struggle to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates across diverse tasks and domains, as they may overfit to the distributional characteristics of individual datasets or tasks.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for multitask uncertainty estimation in LLMs include parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, task-conditioning techniques, and meta-learning algorithms. However, these methods often require extensive training data or computationally expensive fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "By jointly prompting LLMs across multiple diverse tasks and domains, we can encourage the model to learn more generalizable and calibrated uncertainty estimates that transfer across different contexts. Multitask prompting can also help to regularize the model's uncertainty estimates and prevent overfitting to specific datasets or tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Multitask Uncertainty Prompting (MUP), a prompting method that jointly elicits uncertainty estimates from LLMs across multiple diverse tasks and domains. The key steps are: 1) Construct a diverse set of prompts spanning different tasks (e.g., QA, NLI, summarization) and domains (e.g., science, history, literature). 2) For each prompt, generate a set of subquestions or subprompts that probe different aspects of the model's uncertainty (e.g., \"What are the key assumptions behind your answer?\" or \"How might your response change if X was different?\"). 3) Prompt the model to generate responses and uncertainty estimates for each subprompt. 4) Aggregate the uncertainty estimates across the subprompts and tasks to obtain a calibrated overall uncertainty score. 5) Fine-tune the prompts and subprompts based on the model's calibration performance across the diverse tasks.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate MUP on a diverse set of benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks and domains, such as GLUE, SuperGLUE, and MultiNLI. Compare against single-task prompting baselines as well as multitask fine-tuning approaches. Metrics include overall calibration error, domain-specific calibration, and accuracy-uncertainty correlation."

        "Title": "Multitask Uncertainty Prompting: Improving Calibration and Generalization of Language Model Uncertainty Estimates",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates across diverse tasks and domains, as they may overfit to the distributional characteristics of individual datasets or tasks. This can lead to overconfident predictions and hinder the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for multitask uncertainty estimation in LLMs, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, task-conditioning, and meta-learning, often require extensive training data or computationally expensive fine-tuning. We propose a novel prompting-based method, Multitask Uncertainty Prompting (MUP), which jointly elicits uncertainty estimates from LLMs across diverse tasks and domains. By exposing the model to a variety of contexts and probing its uncertainty through targeted subquestions, MUP aims to regularize the model's uncertainty estimates and improve their calibration and generalization.",
        "Proposed Method": "Multitask Uncertainty Prompting (MUP) consists of the following key steps:\n1. Construct a diverse set of prompts spanning different tasks (e.g., QA, NLI, summarization) and domains (e.g., science, history, literature).\n2. For each prompt, generate a set of subquestions or subprompts that probe different aspects of the model's uncertainty (e.g., \"What are the key assumptions behind your answer?\" or \"How might your response change if X was different?\").\n3. Prompt the model to generate responses and uncertainty estimates for each subprompt.\n4. Aggregate the uncertainty estimates across the subprompts and tasks to obtain a calibrated overall uncertainty score.\n5. Fine-tune the prompts and subprompts based on the model's calibration performance across the diverse tasks.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Select a diverse set of benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks and domains, such as GLUE (NLI, sentiment analysis), SuperGLUE (QA, coreference resolution), SQuAD (reading comprehension), CNN/DailyMail (summarization), and MNLI (NLI). Aim for a mix of datasets that cover different levels of difficulty and domain specificity.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, create a set of prompts that capture the task format and domain characteristics. For example, for SQuAD, a prompt could be: \"Answer the following question based on the given context: [question] Context: [passage]\". Aim to create at least 5-10 prompts per dataset, covering different question types, lengths, and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 3: Generate Subprompts": "For each prompt, generate a set of subprompts that probe the model's uncertainty. Examples include:\n- \"What are the key assumptions you made in your answer?\"\n- \"How confident are you in your response on a scale of 1-5?\"\n- \"What additional information would help you provide a more accurate answer?\"\n- \"How might your response change if [aspect of the input] was different?\"\nAim to create 3-5 subprompts per prompt, covering different dimensions of uncertainty.",
            "Step 4: Prompt the Model": "For each combination of prompt and subprompt, query the LLM to generate a response and an uncertainty estimate. Experiment with different uncertainty estimation methods, such as:\n- Softmax probability of the predicted output\n- Entropy of the output distribution\n- Variance across multiple sampling runs\n- Explicit uncertainty scores generated by the model (e.g., \"I'm 80% confident in my answer.\")",
            "Step 5: Aggregate Uncertainty Estimates": "For each prompt, aggregate the uncertainty estimates across the subprompts to obtain an overall uncertainty score. Experiment with different aggregation methods, such as:\n- Average or median of the subprompt uncertainty scores\n- Weighted average based on the relevance or specificity of each subprompt\n- Learned aggregation function (e.g., a small MLP) that takes the subprompt uncertainties as input",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Calibration": "Evaluate the calibration of the aggregated uncertainty estimates using metrics such as:\n- Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n- Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)\n- Brier Score\n- Negative Log Likelihood (NLL)\nCompare the calibration performance of MUP against single-task prompting baselines and existing multitask uncertainty estimation methods.",
            "Step 7: Fine-tune Prompts": "Based on the calibration evaluation, fine-tune the prompts and subprompts to improve the model's uncertainty estimation. This can involve:\n- Modifying the wording or specificity of the prompts and subprompts\n- Adding or removing subprompts based on their contribution to calibration\n- Adjusting the aggregation method or weights\nRepeat steps 4-7 for multiple iterations to refine the prompts and improve calibration.",
            "Step 8: Evaluate Generalization": "Evaluate the generalization of the fine-tuned MUP prompts to new tasks and domains not seen during fine-tuning. Select a set of held-out datasets (e.g., from different domains or task types) and evaluate the calibration performance of MUP on these datasets. Compare against single-task prompting baselines and existing multitask uncertainty estimation methods.",
            "Step 9: Analyze Results": "Analyze the results to gain insights into the effectiveness of MUP for improving calibration and generalization of LLM uncertainty estimates. Consider factors such as:\n- The impact of prompt diversity and specificity on calibration\n- The contribution of different subprompts and aggregation methods\n- The trade-off between calibration and accuracy\n- The robustness of MUP to domain shift and task transfer\nUse these insights to refine the MUP methodology and propose future directions for research."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1: Baseline (Single-Task Prompting)": {
                "Input": "Question: What is the capital of France?\nContext: France is a country in Western Europe. It is known for its rich history, cultural heritage, and iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.",
                "Expected Output": "Paris",
                "Uncertainty Estimate": "0.95"
            },
            "Example 1: MUP": {
                "Input": "Question: What is the capital of France?\nContext: France is a country in Western Europe. It is known for its rich history, cultural heritage, and iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.\nSubprompt 1: What are the key assumptions you made in your answer?\nSubprompt 2: How confident are you in your response on a scale of 1-5?\nSubprompt 3: What additional information would help you provide a more accurate answer?",
                "Expected Output": "Paris\nSubprompt 1: I assumed that the capital of France has not changed recently and that the given context does not contain any contradictory information.\nSubprompt 2: 5\nSubprompt 3: I don't need any additional information to answer this question confidently, as the capital of France is a well-known fact.",
                "Aggregated Uncertainty": "0.98",
                "Explanation": "MUP elicits more comprehensive uncertainty estimates by probing different aspects of the model's reasoning process. The subprompts help to validate the assumptions, quantify the confidence level, and assess the sufficiency of the given information. The aggregated uncertainty score is higher than the single-task baseline, indicating improved calibration."
            },
            "Example 2: Baseline (Single-Task Prompting)": {
                "Input": "Question: What is the main theme of the poem \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost?\nContext: \"The Road Not Taken\" is a poem by Robert Frost, published in 1916 as the first poem in his collection \"Mountain Interval\".",
                "Expected Output": "The main theme of \"The Road Not Taken\" is the significance of the choices we make in life and the paths we choose to follow.",
                "Uncertainty Estimate": "0.80"
            },
            "Example 2: MUP": {
                "Input": "Question: What is the main theme of the poem \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost?\nContext: \"The Road Not Taken\" is a poem by Robert Frost, published in 1916 as the first poem in his collection \"Mountain Interval\".\nSubprompt 1: What are the key assumptions you made in your answer?\nSubprompt 2: How confident are you in your response on a scale of 1-5?\nSubprompt 3: What additional information would help you provide a more accurate answer?",
                "Expected Output": "The main theme of \"The Road Not Taken\" is the significance of the choices we make in life and the paths we choose to follow.\nSubprompt 1: I assumed that the poem is open to interpretation and that the context provided does not contain a definitive answer to the question.\nSubprompt 2: 3\nSubprompt 3: Having more information about the specific content and symbolism used in the poem would help me provide a more accurate and nuanced interpretation of its main theme.",
                "Aggregated Uncertainty": "0.60",
                "Explanation": "MUP helps to uncover the model's uncertainty by probing the assumptions, confidence level, and the need for additional information. In this case, the model acknowledges the interpretive nature of the question and the limited context provided, resulting in a lower aggregated uncertainty score compared to the single-task baseline. This indicates that MUP can effectively capture the model's uncertainty in more subjective or open-ended domains."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed MUP method does not significantly improve the calibration and generalization of LLM uncertainty estimates compared to the baselines, consider the following fallback options:\n1. Analyze the generated subprompts and responses to identify potential weaknesses or inconsistencies in the prompting strategy. Refine the subprompts to better capture different aspects of uncertainty and reasoning.\n2. Experiment with alternative uncertainty estimation methods, such as Bayesian approximation techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) or ensemble-based approaches, in combination with MUP.\n3. Investigate the impact of different prompt formats, such as question-answering, completion, or dialogue-based prompts, on the effectiveness of MUP. Adapt the prompting strategy to better suit the characteristics of each task and domain.\n4. Collect human annotations of uncertainty on a subset of the test cases to validate the model's uncertainty estimates and calibrate the aggregation method. Use these annotations to guide the fine-tuning process and improve the interpretability of the uncertainty scores.\n5. Conduct a thorough error analysis to identify common patterns or factors contributing to the model's uncertainty miscalibration. Use these insights to develop targeted interventions or data augmentation techniques to address specific challenges.\n6. If the MUP method consistently underperforms the baselines, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations and trade-offs of existing uncertainty estimation approaches for LLMs. Conduct a systematic comparison of different methods across various tasks and domains to provide valuable insights for future research directions."
