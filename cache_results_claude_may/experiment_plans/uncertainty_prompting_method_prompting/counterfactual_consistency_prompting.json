        "Problem": "Large language models often exhibit inconsistency in their responses when presented with logically equivalent queries phrased differently, leading to poor calibration of confidence scores.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for calibrating confidence scores include temperature scaling, ensemble methods, and post-hoc calibration techniques. However, these methods do not address the fundamental issue of inconsistency in model outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Counterfactual reasoning has been shown to improve the robustness and consistency of machine learning models in various domains. By generating counterfactual examples and enforcing consistency in model responses, we can potentially improve the calibration of confidence scores in large language models.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Counterfactual Consistency Prompting (CCP), a novel prompting technique that generates counterfactual queries for a given input and enforces consistency in the model's responses. The steps are as follows: 1) Given an input query, generate multiple counterfactual queries that are logically equivalent but phrased differently using a counterfactual generation model. 2) Prompt the language model with each counterfactual query and obtain the corresponding responses and confidence scores. 3) Compute a consistency score based on the similarity of the responses and the variance in confidence scores. 4) Incorporate the consistency score into the final confidence estimation by penalizing inconsistent responses.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCP on benchmark datasets for confidence calibration, such as TruthfulQA and SQuAD. Compare the calibration performance (e.g., ECE, MCE) of CCP with baseline methods such as temperature scaling and ensemble methods. Additionally, assess the robustness of CCP by measuring its performance on adversarially generated counterfactual examples."

        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often exhibit inconsistency in their responses when presented with logically equivalent queries phrased differently, leading to poor calibration of confidence scores. This inconsistency and poor calibration can limit the reliability and trustworthiness of these models in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for calibrating confidence scores, such as temperature scaling, ensemble methods, and post-hoc calibration techniques, do not address the fundamental issue of inconsistency in model outputs. Counterfactual reasoning has been shown to improve the robustness and consistency of machine learning models in various domains. By generating counterfactual examples and enforcing consistency in model responses, we hypothesize that we can improve the calibration of confidence scores in large language models.",

The steps are as follows:\n1. Given an input query, generate multiple counterfactual queries that are logically equivalent but phrased differently using a counterfactual generation model.\n2.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate CCP on benchmark datasets for confidence calibration, such as TruthfulQA and SQuAD. These datasets contain questions with varying levels of difficulty and require models to provide confidence scores along with their answers.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1. Baseline Prompt: Directly prompt the language model with the original input query and obtain the response and confidence score.\n2. CCP Prompt: a) Generate counterfactual queries using a counterfactual generation model. Example counterfactual queries for the question \"What is the capital of France?\" could be \"Which city serves as the seat of government for France?\", \"What is the most populous city in France that houses the country's government?\", and \"Which French city is known for being the center of political power in the country?\"\nb) Prompt the language model with each counterfactual query and obtain the corresponding responses and confidence scores.\nc) Compute the consistency score based on the similarity of the responses (e.g., using cosine similarity or exact match) and the variance in confidence scores.\nd) Incorporate the consistency score into the final confidence estimation. For example, the final confidence score could be calculated as: original_confidence * (1 - consistency_penalty), where consistency_penalty is a function of the consistency score.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate CCP on state-of-the-art language models, such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. Additionally, compare the performance of CCP with baseline methods, such as temperature scaling and ensemble methods.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate Results": "1. Compute the calibration metrics, such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), for the baseline and CCP methods.\n2. Analyze the impact of CCP on the model's accuracy and calibration performance.\n3. Assess the robustness of CCP by measuring its performance on adversarially generated counterfactual examples.",
            "Step 5: Ablation Studies": "1. Vary the number of counterfactual queries generated for each input query and analyze the impact on calibration performance.\n2. Experiment with different consistency score computation methods and consistency penalty functions.\n3. Evaluate the performance of CCP with different counterfactual generation models."

The model's responses to these queries are highly consistent with each other and with the baseline output, resulting in a very high consistency score. The final confidence score is adjusted based on the consistency score, leading to a more calibrated confidence estimate that is slightly higher than the baseline confidence."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Counterfactual Consistency Prompting method does not improve the calibration performance compared to the baseline methods, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated counterfactual queries to ensure they are logically equivalent to the original query and diverse enough to capture different phrasings. If the counterfactual queries are not of high quality, we can explore alternative counterfactual generation models or techniques.\n2. Investigate the consistency score computation method and the consistency penalty function. We can experiment with different similarity metrics for comparing the model's responses and different ways of incorporating the consistency score into the final confidence estimation.\n3. Explore the impact of fine-tuning the language model on a dataset specifically designed for confidence calibration, such as TruthfulQA, before applying the CCP method. Fine-tuning the model on a calibration-specific dataset may help improve its baseline calibration performance and make it more amenable to the CCP approach.\n4. If the CCP method does not yield significant improvements, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the factors that contribute to the inconsistency and poor calibration of language models. This could involve studying the relationship between model size, training data, and calibration performance, as well as investigating the impact of different prompting strategies on the model's consistency and calibration. The insights gained from this analysis could inform the development of new techniques for improving the calibration of language models."
