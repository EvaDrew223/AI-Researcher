    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "In dialogue systems powered by large language models, it is crucial to effectively communicate uncertainty to users and guide the conversation based on the model's confidence in its responses. Current dialogue systems often generate responses without considering the model's uncertainty, leading to overconfident or inconsistent behavior.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for incorporating uncertainty in dialogue systems include using confidence thresholds to filter out low-confidence responses, or generating multiple candidate responses and selecting the most confident one. However, these methods do not effectively guide the conversation based on the model's uncertainty.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a novel approach to uncertainty-guided dialogue prompting, where the LLM actively incorporates its uncertainty estimates into the conversation flow. By generating prompts that seek clarification or additional information in areas of high uncertainty, the model can guide the user to provide more context and improve the quality of the interaction.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Uncertainty-Guided Dialogue Prompting (UGDP), consists of the following steps: 1) Given a user's input utterance, prompt the LLM to generate a response along with an uncertainty estimate. 2) If the uncertainty estimate is above a threshold, prompt the LLM to generate a clarification question or request for additional information related to the uncertain aspects of the response. 3) Present the clarification question to the user and incorporate their response into the conversation context. 4) Repeat steps 1-3 until the uncertainty estimate falls below the threshold or a maximum number of clarification turns is reached. 5) Generate the final response based on the accumulated context and present it to the user.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UGDP on a range of dialogue tasks, such as customer support, information seeking, and open-domain conversation. We will compare the quality of the generated responses and the effectiveness of the uncertainty-guided prompts against baselines such as direct prompting and confidence thresholding. Metrics will include response coherence, user engagement, and task completion rate. We will also conduct human evaluations to assess the naturalness and helpfulness of the uncertainty-guided prompts."

        "Title": "Uncertainty-Guided Dialogue Prompting for Improved Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "In dialogue systems powered by large language models, it is crucial to effectively communicate uncertainty to users and guide the conversation based on the model's confidence in its responses. Current dialogue systems often generate responses without considering the model's uncertainty, leading to overconfident or inconsistent behavior.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for incorporating uncertainty in dialogue systems, such as using confidence thresholds or generating multiple candidate responses, do not effectively guide the conversation based on the model's uncertainty. We propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Guided Dialogue Prompting (UGDP), where the LLM actively incorporates its uncertainty estimates into the conversation flow. By generating prompts that seek clarification or additional information in areas of high uncertainty, the model can guide the user to provide more context and improve the quality of the interaction. This approach is inspired by human-like communication strategies, where individuals naturally ask for clarification or additional information when uncertain about a topic.",
        "Proposed Method": "UGDP consists of the following steps:\n1. Given a user's input utterance, prompt the LLM to generate a response along with an uncertainty estimate.\n2. If the uncertainty estimate is above a threshold, prompt the LLM to generate a clarification question or request for additional information related to the uncertain aspects of the response.\n3. Present the clarification question to the user and incorporate their response into the conversation context.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the uncertainty estimate falls below the threshold or a maximum number of clarification turns is reached.\n5. Generate the final response based on the accumulated context and present it to the user.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Evaluate UGDP on a range of dialogue tasks, such as customer support (e.g., MultiWOZ), information seeking (e.g., QuAC), and open-domain conversation (e.g., DailyDialog, PersonaChat). These datasets cover various domains and conversation types, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Compare UGDP against the following baselines:\n1. Direct prompting: Generate responses directly from the user's input without considering uncertainty.\n2. Confidence thresholding: Generate responses and filter out those with uncertainty estimates above a threshold.\n3. Response ranking: Generate multiple candidate responses and select the one with the lowest uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 3: Uncertainty Estimation": "Experiment with different approaches for estimating the uncertainty of generated responses:\n1. Softmax probability: Use the softmax probability of the generated response as an uncertainty estimate.\n2. Ensemble variance: Generate responses using an ensemble of models and calculate the variance of the output probabilities as an uncertainty estimate.\n3. Dropout-based uncertainty: Apply dropout during inference and calculate the variance of the generated responses as an uncertainty estimate.",
            "Step 4: Clarification Question Generation": "Develop prompts for generating clarification questions or requests for additional information based on the uncertain aspects of the response. For example:\n- \"What additional information would help me provide a more accurate response to your question about [topic]?\"\n- \"I'm not entirely sure about [uncertain aspect]. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?\"\nExperiment with different prompt templates and evaluate their effectiveness in eliciting useful clarifications from users.",
            "Step 5: Conversation Context Management": "Investigate methods for effectively incorporating user clarifications into the conversation context:\n1. Concatenation: Concatenate the user's clarification with the original input utterance.\n2. Attention-based integration: Use attention mechanisms to integrate the user's clarification into the conversation context.\n3. Knowledge grounding: Use the user's clarification to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources and incorporate it into the context.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Evaluate the performance of UGDP and the baseline methods using the following metrics:\n1. Response quality: Assess the coherence, relevance, and informativeness of the generated responses using human evaluation and automatic metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore).\n2. Uncertainty calibration: Measure the calibration between the model's uncertainty estimates and the actual correctness of the generated responses using metrics such as Brier score and expected calibration error (ECE).\n3. User engagement: Evaluate the effectiveness of the clarification questions in eliciting useful information from users and improving the overall conversation quality using human evaluation and user feedback.",
            "Step 7: Model Selection": "Experiment with different large language models, such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and other available models, to assess their performance and suitability for uncertainty-guided dialogue prompting.",
            "Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning": "Tune the following hyperparameters to optimize the performance of UGDP:\n1. Uncertainty threshold: Determine the optimal threshold for triggering clarification questions based on the uncertainty estimate.\n2. Maximum clarification turns: Set the maximum number of clarification turns allowed before generating the final response.",
            "Step 9: Ablation Study": "Conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component of UGDP:\n1. Remove the uncertainty estimation step and generate clarification questions randomly.\n2. Remove the clarification question generation step and generate the final response directly based on the uncertainty estimate.\n3. Remove the conversation context management step and generate the final response based only on the user's initial input.",
            "Step 10: Error Analysis": "Perform a qualitative error analysis to identify common failure modes and areas for improvement in UGDP. Analyze cases where the generated clarification questions are irrelevant, ambiguous, or fail to elicit useful information from users."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "User Input": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
                "Baseline Output (Direct Prompting)": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms may include aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, and a rash on the skin.",
                "Baseline Output (Confidence Thresholding)": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and tiredness.",
                "UGDP Output (Step 1: Response Generation with Uncertainty Estimate)": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms may include aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, and a rash on the skin. [Uncertainty: 0.35]",
                "UGDP Output (Step 2: Clarification Question Generation)": "To provide a more accurate response, could you please specify if you are interested in the most common symptoms or a comprehensive list of all possible symptoms?",
                "User Clarification": "I would like to know the most common symptoms.",
                "UGDP Output (Step 3: Final Response Generation)": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. These symptoms are reported in the majority of cases."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "User Input": "What are the best restaurants in New York City?",
                "Baseline Output (Direct Prompting)": "Some of the best restaurants in New York City include Eleven Madison Park, Le Bernardin, Masa, Per Se, and The French Laundry.",
                "Baseline Output (Response Ranking)": "Some of the best restaurants in New York City include Eleven Madison Park, Le Bernardin, and Masa.",
                "UGDP Output (Step 1: Response Generation with Uncertainty Estimate)": "Some of the best restaurants in New York City include Eleven Madison Park, Le Bernardin, Masa, Per Se, and The French Laundry. [Uncertainty: 0.65]",
                "UGDP Output (Step 2: Clarification Question Generation)": "To provide a more accurate recommendation, could you please specify your preferred cuisine type, price range, and dining occasion?",
                "User Clarification": "I'm looking for a high-end sushi restaurant for a special occasion.",
                "UGDP Output (Step 3: Final Response Generation)": "For a high-end sushi restaurant in New York City suitable for a special occasion, I recommend Masa. It is known for its exceptional omakase menu and intimate dining experience. Another excellent option is Sushi Nakazawa, which offers a memorable sushi tasting menu prepared by skilled chefs."
            },
            "Explanation": "In the first test case, the baseline methods generate responses without considering the model's uncertainty. The confidence thresholding approach filters out some information, but it may not provide the most relevant answer. UGDP, on the other hand, generates a clarification question to better understand the user's intent and provides a more targeted response based on the user's clarification.\n\nIn the second test case, the baseline methods generate recommendations without considering the user's preferences. The response ranking approach selects the top recommendations but may not be tailored to the user's specific needs. UGDP generates a clarification question to gather more information about the user's preferences and provides a more personalized recommendation based on the user's clarification."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UGDP method does not significantly improve the performance of dialogue systems compared to the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches:\n\n1. Analyze the generated clarification questions to determine if they are relevant, clear, and effective in eliciting useful information from users. If the clarification questions are not of high quality, investigate alternative question generation techniques, such as using pre-defined question templates or leveraging knowledge from external sources.\n\n2. Evaluate the uncertainty estimation methods and determine if they accurately capture the model's confidence in its responses. If the uncertainty estimates are not reliable, explore alternative approaches, such as using Bayesian neural networks or calibrating the uncertainty estimates using additional training data.\n\n3. Investigate the impact of different conversation context management techniques on the performance of UGDP. If the current methods do not effectively incorporate user clarifications into the context, consider using more advanced techniques, such as hierarchical attention networks or graph-based representations.\n\n4. Conduct a user study to gather feedback on the effectiveness and usability of UGDP in real-world dialogue scenarios. Analyze user feedback to identify areas for improvement and iterate on the design of the clarification question generation and response generation components.\n\n5. If the performance of UGDP remains unsatisfactory after exploring these alternatives, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the limitations of current dialogue systems in handling uncertainty. Conduct a thorough error analysis to identify common failure modes and propose potential solutions for future research."
