    "idea_name": "Introspective Confidence Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle with calibrating their confidence, especially when it comes to complex reasoning tasks or domain-specific knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for confidence calibration include temperature scaling, ensemble methods, and post-hoc calibration techniques. However, these methods often rely on external data or models and do not fully leverage the introspective capabilities of language models.",
        "Motivation": "Language models have shown the ability to engage in introspection and self-reflection when prompted appropriately. By leveraging this introspective capacity, we can encourage the model to assess its own confidence more accurately, considering factors such as the complexity of the task, the availability of relevant knowledge, and the potential for ambiguity or uncertainty in the input.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Introspective Confidence Prompting, a method that prompts the language model to engage in a series of self-reflective steps before providing a final answer and confidence score. The prompts are designed to guide the model through a process of self-assessment, considering factors such as the difficulty of the task, the relevance of its knowledge, and the potential for multiple valid interpretations. For example, the model might be prompted to first identify the key components of the task, then assess its confidence in each component, and finally combine these assessments into an overall confidence score. The specific prompts can be tailored to different types of tasks and domains.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Introspective Confidence Prompting on a range of benchmarks that test both complex reasoning (e.g., MMLU) and domain-specific knowledge (e.g., QuALITY). We will compare the calibration and accuracy of the model's confidence scores against baseline methods such as temperature scaling and ensemble methods. We will also conduct ablation studies to identify the most effective components of the introspective prompting process."

        "Title": "Introspective Confidence Prompting: Leveraging Language Models' Self-Reflection for Uncertainty Quantification",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle with calibrating their confidence, especially when it comes to complex reasoning tasks or domain-specific knowledge. This can lead to overconfident predictions and hinder the reliability of these models in real-world applications.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for confidence calibration, such as temperature scaling, ensemble methods, and post-hoc calibration techniques, often rely on external data or models and do not fully leverage the introspective capabilities of language models. Language models have shown the ability to engage in introspection and self-reflection when prompted appropriately.

The specific prompts can be tailored to different types of tasks and domains.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate Introspective Confidence Prompting on a range of benchmarks that test both complex reasoning (e.g., MMLU) and domain-specific knowledge (e.g., QuALITY). These datasets cover various domains such as science, history, and current events, and require the model to answer multiple-choice questions or generate open-ended responses.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, we will design a set of introspective prompts that guide the model through the self-assessment process. The prompts will be tailored to the specific characteristics of each dataset and task type. For example, for a science question, the prompts might ask the model to identify the relevant scientific concepts, assess its understanding of each concept, and consider potential edge cases or exceptions. The prompts will be designed iteratively based on the model's performance and feedback from human evaluators.",
            "Step 3: Establish Baselines": "We will compare the performance of Introspective Confidence Prompting against several baseline methods, including: (1) Direct prompting: Asking the model to directly answer the question and provide a confidence score; (2) Temperature scaling: Calibrating the model's confidence scores using a temperature parameter; (3) Ensemble methods: Combining the predictions and confidence scores of multiple models; (4) Post-hoc calibration: Adjusting the confidence scores based on the model's performance on a held-out calibration set.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate Performance": "For each dataset and method, we will evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and calibration error (e.g., expected calibration error, maximum calibration error). We will also conduct a qualitative analysis of the model's responses and confidence scores to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement.",
            "Step 5: Conduct Ablation Studies": "To better understand the contribution of each component of Introspective Confidence Prompting, we will conduct ablation studies by selectively removing or modifying different parts of the prompts. For example, we might compare the performance of prompts that only consider task difficulty versus those that also consider knowledge relevance and ambiguity. These studies will help identify the most effective components of the introspective prompting process.",
            "Step 6: Analyze and Interpret Results": "Based on the quantitative and qualitative results, we will analyze the effectiveness of Introspective Confidence Prompting in improving the calibration and accuracy of language models. We will interpret the results in light of the specific characteristics of each dataset and task type, and discuss the implications for real-world applications. We will also identify limitations and potential directions for future research."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Dataset": "MMLU",
                "Question": "Which of the following is NOT a type of rock?\nA) Igneous\nB) Sedimentary\nC) Metamorphic\nD) Basaltic",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Answer the following question and provide a confidence score:\n\nWhich of the following is NOT a type of rock?\nA) Igneous\nB) Sedimentary\nC) Metamorphic\nD) Basaltic",
                "Baseline Output": "D) Basaltic\nConfidence: 0.8",
                "Introspective Prompt": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the key concepts in the question and assess your familiarity with each one:\n- Igneous rocks: Formed from cooled magma or lava. Familiarity: High\n- Sedimentary rocks: Formed from deposited sediments that are compacted and cemented together. Familiarity: High\n- Metamorphic rocks: Formed when existing rocks are subjected to high heat and pressure, causing them to change their physical and chemical properties. Familiarity: High\n- Basaltic rocks: A type of igneous rock formed from rapidly cooled lava. Familiarity: Moderate\n\n2. Consider the relationship between the concepts and the question:\nBasaltic rocks are a specific type of igneous rock, while igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic are the three main categories of rocks. Therefore, basaltic does not belong in the same classification level as the other three options.\n\n3. Assess the confidence in your answer:\nBased on the familiarity with the key concepts and the clear distinction between the three main rock categories and the specific type of igneous rock, the confidence in the answer is high.\n\nFinal Answer: D) Basaltic\nConfidence: 0.95",
                "Introspective Output": "D) Basaltic\nConfidence: 0.95",
                "Explanation": "The introspective prompting encourages the model to break down the question, assess its familiarity with each concept, and consider the relationships between them. This leads to a more accurate confidence score compared to the baseline prompt, which does not encourage the same level of self-reflection."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Dataset": "QuALITY",
                "Question": "What was the main cause of the Thirty Years' War?",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Answer the following question and provide a confidence score:\n\nWhat was the main cause of the Thirty Years' War?",
                "Baseline Output": "The main cause of the Thirty Years' War was religious tensions between Protestants and Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire.\nConfidence: 0.9",
                "Introspective Prompt": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the key aspects of the question and assess your knowledge of each one:\n- Thirty Years' War: A conflict primarily in Central Europe from 1618 to 1648. Knowledge: Moderate\n- Causes of the war: Multiple factors, including religious, political, and territorial disputes. Knowledge: Limited\n\n2. Consider potential uncertainties or ambiguities in the question:\nThe question asks for the \"main cause\" of the war, but historical events often have multiple contributing factors. It may be challenging to identify a single main cause without a more thorough analysis of the historical context.\n\n3. Assess the confidence in your answer:\nBased on the limited knowledge of the specific causes of the Thirty Years' War and the potential for multiple contributing factors, the confidence in identifying a single main cause is moderate.\n\nFinal Answer: The Thirty Years' War had multiple causes, including religious tensions between Protestants and Catholics, political power struggles within the Holy Roman Empire, and territorial disputes among European states. While religious tensions were a significant factor, it is difficult to identify a single main cause without a more in-depth analysis of the historical context.\nConfidence: 0.6",
                "Introspective Output": "The Thirty Years' War had multiple causes, including religious tensions between Protestants and Catholics, political power struggles within the Holy Roman Empire, and territorial disputes among European states. While religious tensions were a significant factor, it is difficult to identify a single main cause without a more in-depth analysis of the historical context.\nConfidence: 0.6",
                "Explanation": "The introspective prompting helps the model recognize the limitations of its knowledge and the potential for multiple contributing factors in a complex historical event. This leads to a more nuanced and uncertain response compared to the baseline prompt, which overconfidently asserts a single main cause."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Introspective Confidence Prompting method does not consistently improve the calibration and accuracy of language models compared to the baselines, we will conduct additional analyses to identify potential reasons for the lack of improvement. These analyses may include:\n\n1. Examining the quality and relevance of the introspective prompts for each dataset and task type. We will assess whether the prompts effectively guide the model through the self-assessment process and identify areas for improvement.\n\n2. Investigating the relationship between the model's performance and the complexity of the task or the domain-specificity of the knowledge required. We will analyze whether the effectiveness of Introspective Confidence Prompting varies depending on these factors and consider potential modifications to the prompting strategy.\n\n3. Exploring alternative prompting techniques or combining Introspective Confidence Prompting with other confidence calibration methods. For example, we may investigate the use of multi-stage prompting, where the model first generates a response and then assesses its confidence in a separate step.\n\nBased on the findings from these additional analyses, we will propose modifications to the Introspective Confidence Prompting method or develop alternative approaches for improving the calibration and accuracy of language models. If the results suggest that the current approach is fundamentally limited, we will shift the focus of the project towards a more in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the model's confidence and the challenges associated with uncertainty quantification in language models. This analysis could provide valuable insights for future research on confidence calibration and inform the development of more effective methods."
