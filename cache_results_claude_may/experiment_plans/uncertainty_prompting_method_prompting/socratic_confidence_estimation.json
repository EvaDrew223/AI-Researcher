    "idea_name": "Socratic Confidence Estimation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their own confidence, especially when faced with complex or ambiguous questions. This can lead to overconfident predictions and a lack of calibration between the model's confidence scores and its actual accuracy.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in language models include temperature scaling, Monte Carlo dropout, and ensemble methods. However, these methods often rely on post-hoc adjustments to the model's outputs and do not directly address the underlying causes of miscalibration.",
        "Motivation": "The Socratic method is a form of dialogue in which a teacher asks a series of probing questions to guide a student towards a deeper understanding of a topic. By engaging in a similar process of self-questioning and reflection, a language model may be able to better assess its own knowledge and uncertainty, leading to more accurate confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Socratic Confidence Estimation, a method in which the language model engages in a series of self-directed questions and reflections to estimate its confidence in a given prediction. The process consists of the following steps: 1) Generate an initial prediction and confidence score based on the input prompt. 2) Generate a set of follow-up questions that probe the model's understanding of the topic and its reasoning behind the initial prediction. 3) Generate responses to each of the follow-up questions, along with associated confidence scores. 4) Use the responses and confidence scores from the follow-up questions to update the initial confidence estimate, giving more weight to responses that indicate a deeper understanding of the topic. 5) Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until the confidence estimate converges.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Socratic Confidence Estimation on a range of language understanding tasks, including question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. We will compare the calibration and accuracy of the method against baseline approaches such as temperature scaling and Monte Carlo dropout. We will also conduct ablation studies to investigate the impact of different components of the method, such as the number of follow-up questions and the weighting scheme used to update the confidence estimates. Finally, we will qualitatively analyze the generated follow-up questions and responses to gain insight into the model's reasoning process and the effectiveness of the Socratic approach."

        "Title": "Socratic Confidence Estimation: Improving Language Model Calibration through Self-Questioning",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their own confidence, especially when faced with complex or ambiguous questions. This can lead to overconfident predictions and a lack of calibration between the model's confidence scores and its actual accuracy.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for confidence estimation in language models, such as temperature scaling, Monte Carlo dropout, and ensemble methods, often rely on post-hoc adjustments to the model's outputs and do not directly address the underlying causes of miscalibration. The Socratic method, a form of dialogue in which a teacher asks a series of probing questions to guide a student towards a deeper understanding of a topic, inspires our approach. By engaging in a similar process of self-questioning and reflection, a language model may be able to better assess its own knowledge and uncertainty, leading to more accurate confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "Socratic Confidence Estimation is a method in which the language model engages in a series of self-directed questions and reflections to estimate its confidence in a given prediction. The process consists of the following steps:\n1. Generate an initial prediction and confidence score based on the input prompt.\n2. Generate a set of follow-up questions that probe the model's understanding of the topic and its reasoning behind the initial prediction.\n3. Generate responses to each of the follow-up questions, along with associated confidence scores.\n4. Use the responses and confidence scores from the follow-up questions to update the initial confidence estimate, giving more weight to responses that indicate a deeper understanding of the topic.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until the confidence estimate converges.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Evaluate Socratic Confidence Estimation on a range of language understanding tasks, including question answering (SQuAD, TriviaQA), natural language inference (MNLI, SNLI), and sentiment analysis (SST-2, IMDB). Use accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier Score as calibration metrics.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Compare Socratic Confidence Estimation against the following baseline approaches:\n1. Raw confidence scores: Use the model's raw output probabilities as confidence estimates.\n2. Temperature scaling: Calibrate the model's confidence scores using a single temperature parameter, tuned on a validation set.\n3. Monte Carlo dropout: Perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled and use the variance of the outputs as a measure of uncertainty.\n4. Ensemble methods: Train multiple models with different random seeds and use the disagreement among their predictions as a measure of uncertainty.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Engineering": "Design a set of prompts for generating follow-up questions and responses. The prompts should encourage the model to probe its understanding of the topic and its reasoning behind the initial prediction. Examples:\n- 'What evidence supports your initial prediction?'\n- 'Are there any counterarguments or alternative explanations to consider?'\n- 'How confident are you in your understanding of the key concepts related to this question?'",
            "Step 4: Hyperparameter Tuning": "Tune the following hyperparameters using a validation set:\n1. Number of follow-up questions generated per iteration.\n2. Number of iterations (or convergence threshold).\n3. Weighting scheme for updating the confidence estimate based on the follow-up responses.",
            "Step 5: Model Selection": "Evaluate Socratic Confidence Estimation using GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 models from the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation": "Compute performance and calibration metrics for Socratic Confidence Estimation and the baseline methods on the test sets of the selected datasets. Analyze the results to determine if Socratic Confidence Estimation leads to improved calibration compared to the baselines.",
            "Step 7: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to investigate the impact of different components of Socratic Confidence Estimation:\n1. Vary the number of follow-up questions generated per iteration.\n2. Vary the number of iterations (or convergence threshold).\n3. Compare different weighting schemes for updating the confidence estimate based on the follow-up responses.",
            "Step 8: Qualitative Analysis": "Analyze the generated follow-up questions and responses to gain insight into the model's reasoning process and the effectiveness of the Socratic approach. Identify common patterns or themes in the follow-up questions that lead to improved confidence estimates."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "What is the capital of France?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Paris (confidence: 0.95)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Iteration 1)": "What is the capital of France?\nFollow-up questions:\n1. What evidence supports your initial prediction?\n2. Are there any other major cities in France that could potentially be the capital?\n3. How confident are you in your understanding of the political and administrative structure of France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Iteration 1)": "1. Paris is widely known as the capital of France. It is the seat of the French government and the location of many important political and cultural institutions.\n2. While there are other major cities in France, such as Lyon and Marseille, none of them serve as the capital. Paris has been the capital of France since the 12th century.\n3. I am highly confident in my understanding of France's political and administrative structure. Paris is unequivocally the capital and the center of French government.\nUpdated confidence: 0.98",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Iteration 2)": "What is the capital of France?\nFollow-up questions:\n1. Can you provide more historical context for why Paris became the capital of France?\n2. Are there any instances where the capital of France was temporarily moved to another city?\n3. How does the role of Paris as the capital impact its economic and cultural significance within France?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Iteration 2)": "1. Paris became the capital of France in the 12th century under the reign of King Philip II. Its central location, defensive capabilities, and growing economic importance contributed to its selection as the capital.\n2. During World War I and World War II, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux and Tours, respectively, due to the threat of German invasion. However, these were temporary moves, and Paris remained the official capital throughout.\n3. As the capital, Paris is the center of French political power and decision-making. This has contributed to its status as an economic and cultural hub, attracting businesses, investors, and tourists from around the world. Paris is also home to many of France's most iconic landmarks and cultural institutions.\nUpdated confidence: 0.99",
            "Explanation": "The proposed Socratic Confidence Estimation method generates follow-up questions that probe the model's understanding of the topic and its reasoning behind the initial prediction. By engaging in this process of self-reflection and providing detailed responses to the follow-up questions, the model demonstrates a deeper understanding of the subject matter, leading to a higher confidence estimate. In contrast, the baseline method relies solely on the initial prediction and does not engage in any additional reasoning or self-questioning, resulting in a potentially overconfident prediction."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Socratic Confidence Estimation method does not lead to improved calibration compared to the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated follow-up questions and responses to identify potential weaknesses or areas for improvement in the prompts. Refine the prompts to encourage more effective self-questioning and reflection.\n2. Explore alternative methods for updating the confidence estimate based on the follow-up responses, such as using machine learning models to learn the relationship between the responses and the final confidence score.\n3. Investigate the impact of domain-specific knowledge on the effectiveness of Socratic Confidence Estimation. Develop domain-specific prompts or incorporate external knowledge sources to improve the model's ability to generate relevant follow-up questions and responses.\n4. Consider combining Socratic Confidence Estimation with other calibration methods, such as temperature scaling or ensemble methods, to leverage the strengths of multiple approaches.\nIf the proposed method fails to yield significant improvements, focus on analyzing the generated follow-up questions and responses to gain insights into the model's reasoning process and the challenges of confidence estimation in language models. This analysis can inform the development of alternative approaches or be used to highlight the limitations of current confidence estimation techniques."
