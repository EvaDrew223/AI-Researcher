    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to overconfident outputs even when the model is unsure. This can be particularly problematic in high-stakes applications such as healthcare or finance, where the cost of an incorrect prediction can be severe.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches for improving uncertainty estimation in LLMs include confidence calibration techniques such as temperature scaling and label smoothing, as well as methods that incorporate uncertainty into the training objective, such as evidential deep learning.",
        "Motivation": "Contrastive learning has been shown to be effective in improving the discriminative power of machine learning models by learning to distinguish between similar and dissimilar examples. By applying contrastive learning techniques to the prompting process, we can help LLMs better differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to more calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Uncertainty Prompting (CUP), a prompting approach that uses contrastive learning to improve the uncertainty estimation of LLMs. During prompting, we generate a set of contrastive examples by perturbing the input text in ways that are designed to increase or decrease the model's uncertainty. For example, we may add noise to the input, remove key words or phrases, or replace entities with similar but incorrect alternatives. We then prompt the model to generate outputs for both the original and contrastive examples, and encourage it to assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive examples. By learning to distinguish between certain and uncertain predictions in a contrastive manner, CUP helps LLMs develop a more fine-grained understanding of their own uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CUP on a range of language understanding tasks, including sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and named entity recognition. We will compare the uncertainty estimation performance of CUP against baseline methods such as temperature scaling and evidential deep learning. Evaluation metrics will include expected calibration error (ECE), Brier score, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). We will also analyze the model's ability to distinguish between certain and uncertain predictions by measuring its accuracy and confidence on the contrastive examples."

        "Title": "Contrastive Uncertainty Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to overconfident outputs even when the model is unsure. This can be particularly problematic in high-stakes applications such as healthcare or finance, where the cost of an incorrect prediction can be severe.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for improving uncertainty estimation in LLMs include confidence calibration techniques such as temperature scaling and label smoothing, as well as methods that incorporate uncertainty into the training objective, such as evidential deep learning. However, these methods often require additional training or fine-tuning of the model, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Contrastive learning has been shown to be effective in improving the discriminative power of machine learning models by learning to distinguish between similar and dissimilar examples. By applying contrastive learning techniques to the prompting process, we can help LLMs better differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to more calibrated confidence estimates without the need for additional training or fine-tuning.",
        "Proposed Method": "Contrastive Uncertainty Prompting (CUP) is an iterative prompting approach that uses contrastive learning to improve the uncertainty estimation of LLMs. The process involves the following steps:\n1. Given an input text, generate a set of contrastive examples by perturbing the input in ways that are designed to increase or decrease the model's uncertainty. For example, we may add noise to the input, remove key words or phrases, or replace entities with similar but incorrect alternatives.\n2. Prompt the model to generate outputs for both the original and contrastive examples.\n3. Encourage the model to assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive examples by comparing the model's confidence scores for the original and contrastive examples.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until the model's confidence scores converge.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate CUP on a range of language understanding tasks, including sentiment analysis (SST-2, IMDb), textual entailment (MNLI, SNLI, RTE), and named entity recognition (CoNLL-2003). These datasets cover a diverse set of tasks and domains, allowing us to assess the generalizability of our approach.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, we will construct a set of prompts that include both the original input text and the contrastive examples generated using various perturbation strategies. The prompts will be designed to encourage the model to assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive examples. For example, for sentiment analysis, we may use prompts like:\n- Original: \"I loved this movie! The acting was superb and the plot kept me engaged from start to finish. [Positive]\"\n- Contrastive: \"I [MASK] this movie! The acting was [MASK] and the plot kept me [MASK] from start to finish. [Positive/Negative]\"\nFor textual entailment, we may use prompts like:\n- Original: \"Premise: A man is riding a horse. Hypothesis: A man is riding an animal. [Entailment]\"\n- Contrastive: \"Premise: A man is riding a [MASK]. Hypothesis: A man is riding an animal. [Entailment/Neutral/Contradiction]\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will evaluate CUP on a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3 (davinci), GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), and GPT-4. We will compare the performance of these models with and without CUP to assess the effectiveness of our approach.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each dataset and model combination, we will generate predictions using both the original and contrastive prompts. We will then compute the model's confidence scores for each prediction and compare the scores for the original and contrastive examples. We will repeat this process for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 10) or until the model's confidence scores converge.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will evaluate the effectiveness of CUP using a range of metrics, including:\n- Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between the model's confidence and its accuracy. Lower ECE indicates better calibration.\n- Brier Score: Measures the accuracy and calibration of the model's probability estimates. Lower Brier score indicates better performance.\n- Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): Measures the model's ability to distinguish between certain and uncertain predictions. Higher AUPRC indicates better performance.\nWe will compare the performance of each model with and without CUP across all datasets and metrics to assess the overall effectiveness of our approach. We will also analyze the impact of different perturbation strategies and prompt designs on the model's uncertainty estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Review: This movie was terrible. The acting was wooden, the plot was predictable, and the special effects looked cheap and fake. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.\nSentiment:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Negative",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP Step 1: Original)": "Review: This movie was terrible. The acting was wooden, the plot was predictable, and the special effects looked cheap and fake. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.\nSentiment:",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP Step 1: Contrastive)": "Review: This movie was [MASK]. The acting was [MASK], the plot was [MASK], and the special effects looked [MASK] and [MASK]. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this [MASK].\nSentiment:",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUP Step 2: Original)": "Negative\nConfidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUP Step 2: Contrastive)": "Negative\nConfidence: 0.65",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP Step 3: Encourage Uncertainty)": "The model is less confident in its prediction for the contrastive example than for the original example. This suggests that the model is more uncertain when key words and phrases are masked out, which is the desired behavior.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUP Step 4: Repeat)": "Repeat steps 1-3 for multiple iterations or until convergence.",
            "Explanation": "In this example, CUP helps the model assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive example, where key words and phrases have been masked out. This encourages the model to be more cautious in its predictions when the input is ambiguous or incomplete, leading to better calibrated confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CUP does not significantly improve the model's uncertainty estimation, we can explore several alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the impact of different perturbation strategies on the model's confidence scores. Some strategies may be more effective than others at increasing or decreasing uncertainty.\n2. Experiment with different prompt designs and wordings to encourage the model to assign higher uncertainty to contrastive examples. The specific language used in the prompts can have a significant impact on the model's behavior.\n3. Investigate the relationship between the model's confidence scores and its accuracy on the contrastive examples. If the model is consistently overconfident or underconfident on certain types of examples, this could inform the development of more targeted perturbation strategies.\n4. Consider alternative approaches for improving uncertainty estimation, such as post-hoc calibration techniques or modifications to the model architecture. While these approaches may require additional training or fine-tuning, they could provide complementary benefits to CUP.\nIf none of these alternative approaches prove effective, we can still gain valuable insights into the limitations of current uncertainty estimation techniques for LLMs. This could inform the development of new research directions and approaches in the future."
