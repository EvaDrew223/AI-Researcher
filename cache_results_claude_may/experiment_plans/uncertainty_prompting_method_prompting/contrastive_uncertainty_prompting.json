        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to overconfident outputs even when the model is unsure. This can be particularly problematic in high-stakes applications such as healthcare or finance, where the cost of an incorrect prediction can be severe.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches for improving uncertainty estimation in LLMs include confidence calibration techniques such as temperature scaling and label smoothing, as well as methods that incorporate uncertainty into the training objective, such as evidential deep learning.",
        "Motivation": "Contrastive learning has been shown to be effective in improving the discriminative power of machine learning models by learning to distinguish between similar and dissimilar examples. By applying contrastive learning techniques to the prompting process, we can help LLMs better differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to more calibrated confidence estimates.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Contrastive Uncertainty Prompting (CUP), a prompting approach that uses contrastive learning to improve the uncertainty estimation of LLMs. During prompting, we generate a set of contrastive examples by perturbing the input text in ways that are designed to increase or decrease the model's uncertainty. For example, we may add noise to the input, remove key words or phrases, or replace entities with similar but incorrect alternatives. We then prompt the model to generate outputs for both the original and contrastive examples, and encourage it to assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive examples. By learning to distinguish between certain and uncertain predictions in a contrastive manner, CUP helps LLMs develop a more fine-grained understanding of their own uncertainty.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CUP on a range of language understanding tasks, including sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and named entity recognition. We will compare the uncertainty estimation performance of CUP against baseline methods such as temperature scaling and evidential deep learning. Evaluation metrics will include expected calibration error (ECE), Brier score, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). We will also analyze the model's ability to distinguish between certain and uncertain predictions by measuring its accuracy and confidence on the contrastive examples."

        "Title": "Contrastive Uncertainty Prompting: Improving Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often struggle to differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to overconfident outputs even when the model is unsure. This can be particularly problematic in high-stakes applications such as healthcare or finance, where the cost of an incorrect prediction can be severe.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for improving uncertainty estimation in LLMs include confidence calibration techniques such as temperature scaling and label smoothing, as well as methods that incorporate uncertainty into the training objective, such as evidential deep learning. However, these methods often require additional training or fine-tuning of the model, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Contrastive learning has been shown to be effective in improving the discriminative power of machine learning models by learning to distinguish between similar and dissimilar examples. By applying contrastive learning techniques to the prompting process, we can help LLMs better differentiate between certain and uncertain predictions, leading to more calibrated confidence estimates without the need for additional training or fine-tuning.",
        "Proposed Method": "Contrastive Uncertainty Prompting (CUP) is an iterative prompting approach that uses contrastive learning to improve the uncertainty estimation of LLMs. The process involves the following steps:\n1. Given an input text, generate a set of contrastive examples by perturbing the input in ways that are designed to increase or decrease the model's uncertainty. For example, we may add noise to the input, remove key words or phrases, or replace entities with similar but incorrect alternatives.\n2. Prompt the model to generate outputs for both the original and contrastive examples.\n3. Encourage the model to assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive examples by comparing the model's confidence scores for the original and contrastive examples.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for a fixed number of iterations or until the model's confidence scores converge.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate CUP on a range of language understanding tasks, including sentiment analysis (SST-2, IMDb), textual entailment (MNLI, SNLI, RTE), and named entity recognition (CoNLL-2003). These datasets cover a diverse set of tasks and domains, allowing us to assess the generalizability of our approach.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each dataset, we will construct a set of prompts that include both the original input text and the contrastive examples generated using various perturbation strategies. The prompts will be designed to encourage the model to assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive examples. For example, for sentiment analysis, we may use prompts like:\n- Original: \"I loved this movie! The acting was superb and the plot kept me engaged from start to finish. [Positive]\"\n- Contrastive: \"I [MASK] this movie! The acting was [MASK] and the plot kept me [MASK] from start to finish. [Positive/Negative]\"\nFor textual entailment, we may use prompts like:\n- Original: \"Premise: A man is riding a horse. Hypothesis: A man is riding an animal. [Entailment]\"\n- Contrastive: \"Premise: A man is riding a [MASK]. Hypothesis: A man is riding an animal. [Entailment/Neutral/Contradiction]\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will evaluate CUP on a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3 (davinci), GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), and GPT-4. We will compare the performance of these models with and without CUP to assess the effectiveness of our approach.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each dataset and model combination, we will generate predictions using both the original and contrastive prompts. We will then compute the model's confidence scores for each prediction and compare the scores for the original and contrastive examples. We will repeat this process for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 10) or until the model's confidence scores converge.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will evaluate the effectiveness of CUP using a range of metrics, including:\n- Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures the difference between the model's confidence and its accuracy. Lower ECE indicates better calibration.\n- Brier Score: Measures the accuracy and calibration of the model's probability estimates. Lower Brier score indicates better performance.\n- Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): Measures the model's ability to distinguish between certain and uncertain predictions. Higher AUPRC indicates better performance.\nWe will compare the performance of each model with and without CUP across all datasets and metrics to assess the overall effectiveness of our approach. We will also analyze the impact of different perturbation strategies and prompt designs on the model's uncertainty estimation."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Review: This movie was terrible. The acting was wooden, the plot was predictable, and the special effects looked cheap and fake. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.\nSentiment:",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "Negative",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP Step 1: Original)": "Review: This movie was terrible. The acting was wooden, the plot was predictable, and the special effects looked cheap and fake. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.\nSentiment:",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP Step 1: Contrastive)": "Review: This movie was [MASK]. The acting was [MASK], the plot was [MASK], and the special effects looked [MASK] and [MASK]. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this [MASK].\nSentiment:",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUP Step 2: Original)": "Negative\nConfidence: 0.95",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUP Step 2: Contrastive)": "Negative\nConfidence: 0.65",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (CUP Step 3: Encourage Uncertainty)": "The model is less confident in its prediction for the contrastive example than for the original example. This suggests that the model is more uncertain when key words and phrases are masked out, which is the desired behavior.",
            "Proposed Prompt Output (CUP Step 4: Repeat)": "Repeat steps 1-3 for multiple iterations or until convergence.",
            "Explanation": "In this example, CUP helps the model assign higher uncertainty to the contrastive example, where key words and phrases have been masked out. This encourages the model to be more cautious in its predictions when the input is ambiguous or incomplete, leading to better calibrated confidence estimates."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If CUP does not significantly improve the model's uncertainty estimation, we can explore several alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the impact of different perturbation strategies on the model's confidence scores. Some strategies may be more effective than others at increasing or decreasing uncertainty.\n2. Experiment with different prompt designs and wordings to encourage the model to assign higher uncertainty to contrastive examples. The specific language used in the prompts can have a significant impact on the model's behavior.\n3. Investigate the relationship between the model's confidence scores and its accuracy on the contrastive examples. If the model is consistently overconfident or underconfident on certain types of examples, this could inform the development of more targeted perturbation strategies.\n4. Consider alternative approaches for improving uncertainty estimation, such as post-hoc calibration techniques or modifications to the model architecture. While these approaches may require additional training or fine-tuning, they could provide complementary benefits to CUP.\nIf none of these alternative approaches prove effective, we can still gain valuable insights into the limitations of current uncertainty estimation techniques for LLMs. This could inform the development of new research directions and approaches in the future."

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as powerful tools for several high-stakes natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent prompting works claim to elicit intermediate reasoning steps and key tokens that serve as proxy explanations for LLM predictions. However, there is no certainty whether these explanations are reliable and reflect the LLMs behavior. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs. To this end, we propose two novel metrics -- $\\textit{Verbalized Uncertainty}$ and $\\textit{Probing Uncertainty}$ -- to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness. Our study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of quantifying uncertainty in LLM explanations, contributing to the broader discussion of the trustworthiness of foundation models.",

Selective prediction, in which models abstain on low-confidence examples, provides a possible solution, but existing models are often overly confident on unseen classes. To remedy this overconfidence, we introduce Contrastive Novelty-Augmented Learning (CoNAL), a two-step method that generates OOD examples representative of novel classes, then trains to decrease confidence on them. First, we generate OOD examples by prompting a large language model twice: we prompt it to enumerate relevant novel classes, then generate examples from each novel class matching the task format. Second, we train a classifier with a novel contrastive objective that encourages lower confidence on generated OOD examples than training examples. When trained with CoNAL, classifiers improve in their ability to detect and abstain on novel class examples over prior methods by an average of 2.3% in terms of accuracy under the accuracy-coverage curve (AUAC) and 5.5% AUROC across 4 NLP datasets, with no cost to in-distribution accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Empowering large language models to accurately express confidence in their answers is essential for trustworthy decision-making. Previous confidence elicitation methods, which primarily rely on white-box access to internal model information or model fine-tuning, have become less suitable for LLMs, especially closed-source commercial APIs. This leads to a growing need to explore the untapped area of black-box approaches for LLM uncertainty estimation. To better break down the problem, we define a systematic framework with three components: prompting strategies for eliciting verbalized confidence, sampling methods for generating multiple responses, and aggregation techniques for computing consistency. We then benchmark these methods on two key tasks-confidence calibration and failure prediction-across five types of datasets (e.g., commonsense and arithmetic reasoning) and five widely-used LLMs including GPT-4 and LLaMA 2 Chat. Our analysis uncovers several key insights: 1) LLMs, when verbalizing their confidence, tend to be overconfident, potentially imitating human patterns of expressing confidence. 2) As model capability scales up, both calibration and failure prediction performance improve. 3) Employing our proposed strategies, such as human-inspired prompts, consistency among multiple responses, and better aggregation strategies can help mitigate this overconfidence from various perspectives. 4) Comparisons with white-box methods indicate that while white-box methods perform better, the gap is narrow, e.g., 0.522 to 0.605 in AUROC. Despite these advancements, none of these techniques consistently outperform others, and all investigated methods struggle in challenging tasks, such as those requiring professional knowledge, indicating significant scope for improvement. We believe this study can serve as a strong baseline and provide insights for eliciting confidence in black-box LLMs.",

            "abstract": "While large language models excel in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, to perform well on spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks, they must either rely on off-the-shelf automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for transcription, or be equipped with an in-built speech modality. This work focuses on the former scenario, where LLM's accuracy on SLU tasks is constrained by the accuracy of a fixed ASR system on the spoken input. Specifically, we tackle speech-intent classification task, where a high word-error-rate can limit the LLM's ability to understand the spoken intent. Instead of chasing a high accuracy by designing complex or specialized architectures regardless of deployment costs, we seek to answer how far we can go without substantially changing the underlying ASR and LLM, which can potentially be shared by multiple unrelated tasks. To this end, we propose prompting the LLM with an n-best list of ASR hypotheses instead of only the error-prone 1-best hypothesis. We explore prompt-engineering to explain the concept of n-best lists to the LLM; followed by the finetuning of Low-Rank Adapters on the downstream tasks. Our approach using n-best lists proves to be effective on a device-directed speech detection task as well as on a keyword spotting task, where systems using n-best list prompts outperform those using 1-best ASR hypothesis; thus paving the way for an efficient method to exploit ASR uncertainty via LLMs for speech-based applications.",

We argue that a key dimension that is missing from our understanding of language models (LMs) is the model\u2019s ability to interpret and generate expressions of uncertainty . Whether it be the weatherperson announcing a chance of rain or a doctor giving a diagnosis, information is often not black-and-white and expressions of uncertainty provide nuance to support human-decision making. The increasing deployment of LMs in the wild motivates us to investigate whether LMs are capable of interpreting expressions of uncertainty and how LMs\u2019 behaviors change when learning to emit their own expressions of uncertainty. When injecting expressions of uncertainty into prompts (e.g., \"I think the answer is...\"), we discover that GPT3\u2019s generations vary upwards of 80% in accuracy based on the expression used. We analyze the linguistic characteristics of these expressions and \ufb01nd a drop in accuracy when naturalistic expressions of certainty are present. We \ufb01nd similar effects when teaching models to emit their own expressions of uncertainty, where model calibration suffers when teaching models to emit certainty rather than un certainty.

            "abstract": "For a LLM to be trustworthy, its confidence level should be well-calibrated with its actual performance. While it is now common sense that LLM performances are greatly impacted by prompts, the confidence calibration in prompting LLMs has yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we explore how different prompting strategies influence LLM confidence calibration and how it could be improved. We conduct extensive experiments on six prompting methods in the question-answering context and we observe that, while these methods help improve the expected LLM calibration, they also trigger LLMs to be over-confident when responding to some instances. Inspired by human cognition, we propose Fact-and-Reflection (FaR) prompting, which improves the LLM calibration in two steps. First, FaR elicits the known\"facts\"that are relevant to the input prompt from the LLM. And then it asks the model to\"reflect\"over them to generate the final answer. Experiments show that FaR prompting achieves significantly better calibration; it lowers the Expected Calibration Error by 23.5% on our multi-purpose QA tasks. Notably, FaR prompting even elicits the capability of verbally expressing concerns in less confident scenarios, which helps trigger retrieval augmentation for solving these harder instances.",

            "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in natural language generation and instruction following, a persistent challenge lies in their susceptibility to\"hallucinations\", which erodes trust in their outputs. Although Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) presents a promising solution, its accurate implementation within the context of LLMs remains a significant hurdle. To address this critical roadblock, our research originates from a fundamental heuristic insight: tokens within auto-regressive LLM-generated text do not equally reflect the underlying meaning. Some tokens carry greater relevance and representativeness than others, owing to the phenomenon of\"linguistic redundancy\", wherein a select few keywords suffice to convey the essence of lengthy sentences. Regrettably, existing methodologies treat all tokens with equal importance when estimating uncertainty, disregarding these inherent generative inequalities. Our analysis reveals a significant issue with state-of-the-art: numerous tokens (and sentences) of limited semantic significance receive equal or even excessive weighting during uncertainty estimation. To rectify this bias, we propose to jointly Shifting Attention to more Relevant (SAR) components, at both the token- and the sentence-levels for accurate uncertainty estimation. We conduct extensive experiments involving a range of popular\"off-the-shelf\"LLMs, including instruction-tuned LLMs such as Vicuna, WizardLM, and LLaMA-2-chat, as well as pretrained LLMs like OPT and LLaMA, with model sizes extending up to 33B parameters. We carry out evaluation across various free-form question-answering tasks, encompassing domains such as reading comprehension, science Q&A, and medical Q&A. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SAR in addressing the challenges of uncertainty estimation within the realm of LLMs.",

However, erroneous generations, such as false predictions, misinformation, and hallucination made by LLMs, have also raised severe concerns for the trustworthiness of LLMs', especially in safety-, security- and reliability-sensitive scenarios, potentially hindering real-world adoptions. While uncertainty estimation has shown its potential for interpreting the prediction risks made by general machine learning (ML) models, little is known about whether and to what extent it can help explore an LLM's capabilities and counteract its undesired behavior. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we initiate an exploratory study on the risk assessment of LLMs from the lens of uncertainty. In particular, we experiment with twelve uncertainty estimation methods and four LLMs on four prominent natural language processing (NLP) tasks to investigate to what extent uncertainty estimation techniques could help characterize the prediction risks of LLMs. Our findings validate the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation for revealing LLMs' uncertain/non-factual predictions. In addition to general NLP tasks, we extensively conduct experiments with four LLMs for code generation on two datasets. We find that uncertainty estimation can potentially uncover buggy programs generated by LLMs. Insights from our study shed light on future design and development for reliable LLMs, facilitating further research toward enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs.",

The analysis of high-resource languages is of interest as studies have shown that low-resource languages perform worse than English in NLP tasks, but no study so far has analysed whether high-resource languages perform as well as English. The analysis of ChatGPT's confidence calibration has not been carried out before either and is critical to learn about ChatGPT's trustworthiness. In order to study these two aspects, five high-resource languages and two NLP tasks were chosen. ChatGPT was asked to perform both tasks in the five languages and to give a numerical confidence value for each answer. The results show that all the selected high-resource languages perform similarly and that ChatGPT does not have a good confidence calibration, often being overconfident and never giving low confidence values.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing pre-trained language models for NLP. However, these models often struggle when fine-tuned on small datasets. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various adaptation approaches. Prompt-based tuning is arguably the most common way, especially for larger models. Previous research shows that adding contrastive learning to prompt-based fine-tuning is effective as it helps the model generate embeddings that are more distinguishable between classes, and it can also be more sample-efficient as the model learns from positive and negative examples simultaneously. One of the most important components of contrastive learning is data augmentation, but unlike computer vision, effective data augmentation for NLP is still challenging. This paper proposes LM-CPPF, Contrastive Paraphrasing-guided Prompt-based Fine-tuning of Language Models, which leverages prompt-based few-shot paraphrasing using generative language models, especially large language models such as GPT-3 and OPT-175B, for data augmentation.

In this work, we improve the effectiveness of the reward model by introducing a penalty term on the reward, named as \\textit{contrastive rewards}. %Contrastive rewards Our approach involves two steps: (1) an offline sampling step to obtain responses to prompts that serve as baseline calculation and (2) a contrastive reward calculated using the baseline responses and used in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) step. We show that contrastive rewards enable the LLM to penalize reward uncertainty, improve robustness, encourage improvement over baselines, calibrate according to task difficulty, and reduce variance in PPO. We show empirically contrastive rewards can improve RLHF substantially, evaluated by both GPTs and humans, and our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in language models (LMs) have led to significant improvements in quality on complex NLP tasks, but at the expense of increased inference costs. Cascading offers a simple strategy to achieve more favorable cost-quality tradeoffs: here, a small model is invoked for most\"easy\"instances, while a few\"hard\"instances are deferred to the large model. While the principles underpinning cascading are well-studied for classification tasks - with deferral based on predicted class uncertainty favored theoretically and practically - a similar understanding is lacking for generative LM tasks. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of deferral rules for LM cascades. We begin by examining the natural extension of predicted class uncertainty to generative LM tasks, namely, the predicted sequence uncertainty. We show that this measure suffers from the length bias problem, either over- or under-emphasizing outputs based on their lengths. This is because LMs produce a sequence of uncertainty values, one for each output token; and moreover, the number of output tokens is variable across examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose to exploit the richer token-level uncertainty information implicit in generative LMs. We argue that naive predicted sequence uncertainty corresponds to a simple aggregation of these uncertainties. By contrast, we show that incorporating token-level uncertainty through learned post-hoc deferral rules can significantly outperform such simple aggregation strategies, via experiments on a range of natural language benchmarks with FLAN-T5 models. We further show that incorporating embeddings from the smaller model and intermediate layers of the larger model can give an additional boost in the overall cost-quality tradeoff.",

However, contemporary models, despite their impressive capacities, consistently struggle to produce both coherent and diverse data. To address the coherency issue, we introduce contrastive expert guidance, where the difference between the logit distributions of fine-tuned and base language models is emphasised to ensure domain adherence. In order to ensure diversity, we utilise existing real and synthetic examples as negative prompts to the model. We deem this dual-pronged approach to logit reshaping as STEER: Semantic Text Enhancement via Embedding Repositioning. STEER operates at inference-time and systematically guides the LLMs to strike a balance between adherence to the data distribution (ensuring semantic fidelity) and deviation from prior synthetic examples or existing real datasets (ensuring diversity and authenticity). This delicate balancing act is achieved by dynamically moving towards or away from chosen representations in the latent space. STEER demonstrates improved performance over previous synthetic data generation techniques, exhibiting better balance between data diversity and coherency across three distinct tasks: hypothesis generation, toxic and non-toxic comment generation, and commonsense reasoning task generation. We demonstrate how STEER allows for fine-tuned control over the diversity-coherency trade-off via its hyperparameters, highlighting its versatility.",

This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs and prompt engineering approaches. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic experimental study on prompt engineering for five clinical NLP tasks: Clinical Sense Disambiguation, Biomedical Evidence Extraction, Coreference Resolution, Medication Status Extraction, and Medication Attribute Extraction. We assessed the prompts proposed in recent literature, including simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, and anticipatory prompts, and introduced two new types of prompts, namely heuristic prompting and ensemble prompting. We evaluated the performance of these prompts on three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-3.5, BARD, and LLAMA2. We also contrasted zero-shot prompting with few-shot prompting, and provide novel insights and guidelines for prompt engineering for LLMs in clinical NLP.

However, these measures can differ greatly, and it is unclear how to compare them, partly because they take values over different ranges ($e.g.$, $[0,\\infty)$ or $[0,1]$). In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel and practical framework, termed $Rank$-$Calibration$, to assess uncertainty and confidence measures for LMs. Our key tenet is that higher uncertainty (or lower confidence) should imply lower generation quality, on average. Rank-calibration quantifies deviations from this ideal relationship in a principled manner, without requiring ad hoc binary thresholding of the correctness score ($e.g.$, ROUGE or METEOR). The broad applicability and the granular interpretability of our methods are demonstrated empirically.",

These fields often grapple with decision-making under uncertainty, a critical yet challenging task. In this paper, we show that directly prompting LLMs on these types of decision-making problems yields poor results, especially as the problem complexity increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step scaffolding procedure, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an optimal and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our framework on decision-making environments involving real agriculture and finance data. Our results show that DeLLMa can significantly improve LLM decision-making performance, achieving up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods.",

However, the most widely-used LMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF-LMs), and some studies have suggested that RLHF-LMs produce conditional probabilities that are very poorly calibrated.

To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm that thoroughly evaluates the trustability of multiple candidate answers to mitigate the overconfidence on incorrect answers.

Uncertainty estimation (UE) methods are one path to safer, more responsible, and more effective use of LLMs. However, to date, research on UE methods for LLMs has been focused primarily on theoretical rather than engineering contributions. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing LM-Polygraph, a framework with implementations of a battery of state-of-the-art UE methods for LLMs in text generation tasks, with unified program interfaces in Python.

We focus on a fundamental decision-making framework with natural language as input, which is the one of contextual bandits, where the context information consists of text. As a representative of the approaches with no uncertainty estimation, we consider an LLM bandit with a greedy policy, which picks the action corresponding to the largest predicted reward. We compare this baseline to LLM bandits that make active use of uncertainty estimation by integrating the uncertainty in a Thompson Sampling policy. We employ different techniques for uncertainty estimation, such as Laplace Approximation, Dropout, and Epinets. We empirically show on real-world data that the greedy policy performs worse than the Thompson Sampling policies. These findings suggest that, while overlooked in the LLM literature, uncertainty plays a fundamental role in bandit tasks with LLMs.",

However, for solving token-level classification tasks, e.g., named entity recognition (NER), previous research, which utilizes N-gram traversal for prompting all spans with all possible entity types, is time-consuming. To this end, we propose a novel prompt-based contrastive learning method for few-shot NER without template construction and label word mappings. First, we leverage external knowledge to initialize semantic anchors for each entity type. These anchors are simply appended with input sentence embeddings as template-free prompts (TFPs). Then, the prompts and sentence embeddings are in-context optimized with our proposed semantic-enhanced contrastive loss. Our proposed loss function enables contrastive learning in few-shot scenarios without requiring a significant number of negative samples. Moreover, it effectively addresses the issue of conventional contrastive learning, where negative instances with similar semantics are erroneously pushed apart in natural language processing (NLP)-related tasks. We examine our method in label extension (LE), domain-adaption (DA), and low-resource generalization evaluation tasks with six public datasets and different settings, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in most cases.",

In this paper, we propose a Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning (SSCL) framework for text classification, which can significantly improve the performance of deep models in the case of limited labeled data. The proposed framework consists of two components: a pseudo label generation strategy and a contrastive learning scheme for text classification. We first devise a prompt-based strategy for training Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), with a small amount of human-labeled data, to obtain a task-correlation model capable of generating pseudo labels for unlabeled text. Then, for the text classification task, we use a two-step contrastive learning scheme: pre-training a deep model with pseudo labels as supervision to capture inter-class patterns while mitigating the negative impact of pseudo label noise, and then fine-tuning the pre-trained model with human-labeled data using a supervised contrastive learning approach. Benefiting from the generated pseudo labels and anti-noise contrastive pre-training, we only use a small amount of labeled data during the training process for the downstream text classification tasks.

It is known that the effective design of task-specific prompts is critical for LLMs' ability to produce high-quality answers.

This paper proposes a new method, Active-Prompt, to adapt LLMs to different tasks with task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning). For this purpose, we propose a solution to the key problem of determining which questions are the most important and helpful ones to annotate from a pool of task-specific queries. By borrowing ideas from the related problem of uncertainty-based active learning, we introduce several metrics to characterize the uncertainty so as to select the most uncertain questions for annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art on eight complex reasoning tasks. Further analyses of different uncertainty metrics, pool sizes, zero-shot learning, and accuracy-uncertainty relationship demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations.

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have limited performance when solving arithmetic reasoning tasks and often provide incorrect answers. Unlike natural language understanding, math problems typically have a single correct answer, making the task of generating accurate solutions more challenging for LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any LLMs that indicate their level of confidence in their responses which fuels a trust deficit in these models impeding their adoption. To address this deficiency, we propose \u2018MathPrompter\u2019, a technique that improves performance of LLMs on arithmetic problems along with increased reliance in the predictions. MathPrompter uses the Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique to generate multiple algebraic expressions or python functions to solve the same math problem in different ways and thereby raise the confidence level in the output results. This is in contrast to other prompt based CoT methods, where there is no check on the validity of the intermediate steps followed. Our technique improves over state-of-the-art on the \u2018MultiArith\u2019 dataset (78.7% - 92.5%) evaluated using 175B parameter GPT-based LLM.",

Confidence calibration, an effective analysis method for gauging the reliability of deep models, serves as a crucial tool for assessing and improving their reliability. However, such investigation has been comparatively underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic examination of the calibration of aligned language models throughout the entire construction process, including pretraining and alignment training. At each stage, we investigate how different training settings, such as parameter scales and training data, affect model calibration. To thoroughly assess model calibration, we evaluate models on three most concerned aspects: generation, factuality and understanding.

Despite their impressive performance, the models are known to pose important risks. As these models are deployed in real-world applications, a systematic understanding of different risks posed by these models on tasks such as natural language inference (NLI), is much needed. In this paper, we define and formalize two distinct types of risk: decision risk and composite risk. We also propose a risk-centric evaluation framework, and four novel metrics, for assessing LLMs on these risks in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we propose a risk-adjusted calibration method called DwD for helping LLMs minimize these risks in an overall NLI architecture. Detailed experiments, using four NLI benchmarks, three baselines and two LLMs, including ChatGPT, show both the practical utility of the evaluation framework, and the efficacy of DwD in reducing decision and composite risk. For instance, when using DwD, an underlying LLM is able to address an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks (but which the LLM erroneously deems high-risk without risk adjustment) and skip a further 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly.",

This issue can be mitigated by having the LM verbally convey the probability that its claims are correct, but existing models cannot produce text with calibrated confidence statements. Through the lens of decision-making, we formalize linguistic calibration for long-form generations: an LM is linguistically calibrated if its generations enable its users to make calibrated probabilistic predictions. This definition enables a training framework where a supervised finetuning step bootstraps an LM to emit long-form generations with confidence statements such as\"I estimate a 30% chance of...\"or\"I am certain that...\", followed by a reinforcement learning step which rewards generations that enable a user to provide calibrated answers to related questions. We linguistically calibrate Llama 2 7B and find in automated and human evaluations of long-form generations that it is significantly more calibrated than strong finetuned factuality baselines with comparable accuracy. These findings generalize under distribution shift on question-answering and under a significant task shift to person biography generation. Our results demonstrate that long-form generations may be calibrated end-to-end by constructing an objective in the space of the predictions that users make in downstream decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Language models can learn a range of capabilities from unsupervised training on text corpora. However, to solve a particular problem (such as text summarization) it is typically necessary to fine-tune them on a task-specific dataset. It is often easier for humans to choose between options than to provide labeled data, and prior work has achieved state-of-the-art performance by training a reward model from such preference comparisons. However, collecting a large preference comparison dataset is still expensive -- and the learned reward models are unreliable out-of-distribution. We seek to address these problems via uncertainty estimation, which can improve sample efficiency and robustness using active learning and risk-averse reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to train an ensemble of reward models differing in the initialization of their final layer. Ensembles have proved successful in prior applications of active learning, but we find that in our setting ensemble active learning does not outperform random sampling. Further experiments show that while the aggregate predictions are well-calibrated, the ensemble's estimated epistemic uncertainty is only weakly correlated with model error. We suspect this is because the ensemble members are fine-tuned from a single model and so are similar to one another. This suggests current pre-training methods will need to be modified to support uncertainty estimation, e.g. by training multiple language models.",

            "title": "An Empirical Evaluation of Prompting Strategies for Large Language Models in Zero-Shot Clinical Natural Language Processing: Algorithm Development and Validation Study",
            "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP), especially in domains where labeled data are scarce or expensive, such as the clinical domain. However, to unlock the clinical knowledge hidden in these LLMs, we need to design effective prompts that can guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific training data. This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs and prompt engineering approaches. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of various prompt engineering techniques, including 2 newly introduced types\u2014heuristic and ensemble prompts, for zero-shot and few-shot clinical information extraction using pretrained language models. Methods This comprehensive experimental study evaluated different prompt types (simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, anticipatory, heuristic, and ensemble) across 5 clinical NLP tasks: clinical sense disambiguation, biomedical evidence extraction, coreference resolution, medication status extraction, and medication attribute extraction. The performance of these prompts was assessed using 3 state-of-the-art language models: GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and LLaMA-2 (Meta). The study contrasted zero-shot with few-shot prompting and explored the effectiveness of ensemble approaches. Results The study revealed that task-specific prompt tailoring is vital for the high performance of LLMs for zero-shot clinical NLP. In clinical sense disambiguation, GPT-3.5 achieved an accuracy of 0.96 with heuristic prompts and 0.94 in biomedical evidence extraction. Heuristic prompts, alongside chain of thought prompts, were highly effective across tasks. Few-shot prompting improved performance in complex scenarios, and ensemble approaches capitalized on multiple prompt strengths. GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed Gemini and LLaMA-2 across tasks and prompt types. Conclusions This study provides a rigorous evaluation of prompt engineering methodologies and introduces innovative techniques for clinical information extraction, demonstrating the potential of in-context learning in the clinical domain. These findings offer clear guidelines for future prompt-based clinical NLP research, facilitating engagement by non-NLP experts in clinical NLP advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works on the empirical evaluation of different prompt engineering approaches for clinical NLP in this era of generative artificial intelligence, and we hope that it will inspire and inform future research in this area.",

We study the task of cognitive distortion detection and propose the Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) prompting. DoT performs diagnosis on the patient's speech via three stages: subjectivity assessment to separate the facts and the thoughts; contrastive reasoning to elicit the reasoning processes supporting and contradicting the thoughts; and schema analysis to summarize the cognition schemas. The generated diagnosis rationales through the three stages are essential for assisting the professionals.

            "abstract": "The current use of large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking follows one of two ways: 1) prompt-based re-ranking methods, which require no further training but are feasible for only re-ranking a handful of candidate documents due to the associated computational costs; and 2) unsupervised contrastive trained dense retrieval methods, which can retrieve relevant documents from the entire corpus but require a large amount of paired text data for contrastive training. In this paper, we propose PromptReps, which combines the advantages of both categories: no need for training and the ability to retrieve from the whole corpus. Our method only requires prompts to guide an LLM to generate query and document representations for effective document retrieval. Specifically, we prompt the LLMs to represent a given text using a single word, and then use the last token's hidden states and the corresponding logits associated to the prediction of the next token to construct a hybrid document retrieval system. The retrieval system harnesses both dense text embedding and sparse bag-of-words representations given by the LLM. Our experimental evaluation on the BEIR zero-shot document retrieval datasets illustrates that this simple prompt-based LLM retrieval method can achieve a similar or higher retrieval effectiveness than state-of-the-art LLM embedding methods that are trained with large amounts of unsupervised data, especially when using a larger LLM.",

            "abstract": "For large language models (LLMs) to be trusted by humans they need to be well-calibrated in the sense that they can accurately assess and communicate how likely it is that their predictions are correct. Recent work has focused on the quality of internal LLM confidence assessments, but the question remains of how well LLMs can communicate this internal model confidence to human users. This paper explores the disparity between external human confidence in an LLM's responses and the internal confidence of the model. Through experiments involving multiple-choice questions, we systematically examine human users' ability to discern the reliability of LLM outputs. Our study focuses on two key areas: (1) assessing users' perception of true LLM confidence and (2) investigating the impact of tailored explanations on this perception. The research highlights that default explanations from LLMs often lead to user overestimation of both the model's confidence and its' accuracy. By modifying the explanations to more accurately reflect the LLM's internal confidence, we observe a significant shift in user perception, aligning it more closely with the model's actual confidence levels. This adjustment in explanatory approach demonstrates potential for enhancing user trust and accuracy in assessing LLM outputs. The findings underscore the importance of transparent communication of confidence levels in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding the reliability of AI-generated information is essential.",

We take a close look into this problem, aiming to answer two questions: (1) Do PLMs learn to become calibrated in the training process? (2) How effective are existing calibration methods? For the first question, we conduct fine-grained control experiments to study the dynamic change in PLMs\u2019 calibration performance in training. We consider six factors as control variables, including dataset difficulty, available training samples, training steps, the number of tunable parameters, model scale, and pretraining. We observe a consistent change in calibration performance across six factors. We find that PLMs don\u2019t learn to become calibrated in training, evidenced by the continual increase in confidence, no matter whether the predictions are correct or not. We highlight that our finding somewhat contradicts two established conclusions: (a) Larger PLMs are more calibrated; (b) Pretraining improves model calibration. Next, we study the effectiveness of existing calibration methods in mitigating the overconfidence issue. Besides unlearnable calibration methods (e.g., label smoothing), we adapt and extend two recently proposed learnable methods that directly collect data to train models to have reasonable confidence estimations. Experimental results show that learnable methods significantly reduce PLMs\u2019 confidence in wrong predictions.",

Next, we empirically show that calibration methods like temperature scaling and label smoothing do reasonably well in improving calibration in the zero-shot scenario.

In contrast, although auditors do not adjust fully even when misstatements are known with certainty, social bonding has no effect in this scenario. Accordingly, our experiment contributes beyond the main effects of social bonding and measurement uncertainty demonstrated in prior research by showing that these forces interact.

We propose a unique evaluation protocol using adapted ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets to assess models' consistency in recognizing concepts at varying granularity levels and their sensitivity to the specificity of language inputs. Our extensive evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs, including contrastive models like CLIP, struggle with granularity and are sensitive to text specificity, impacting their effectiveness in open-world settings. This comprehensive study, a first in evaluating VLMs from these perspectives, provides valuable insights and tools for the community, highlighting the limitations and paving the way for enhanced models with better generalization in zero-shot recognition.",

            "abstract": "A well-calibrated neural model produces confidence (probability outputs) closely approximated by the expected accuracy. While prior studies have shown that mixup training as a data augmentation technique can improve model calibration on image classification tasks, little is known about using mixup for model calibration on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this paper, we explore mixup for model calibration on several NLU tasks and propose a novel mixup strategy for pre-trained language models that improves model calibration further. Our proposed mixup is guided by both the Area Under the Margin (AUM) statistic (Pleiss et al., 2020) and the saliency map of each sample (Simonyan et al., 2013). Moreover, we combine our mixup strategy with model miscalibration correction techniques (i.e., label smoothing and temperature scaling) and provide detailed analyses of their impact on our proposed mixup. We focus on systematically designing experiments on three NLU tasks: natural language inference, paraphrase detection, and commonsense reasoning. Our method achieves the lowest expected calibration error compared to strong baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain test samples while maintaining competitive accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Cross-lingual natural language understanding (NLU) is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP). Recent advancements have seen multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) significantly enhance the performance of these tasks. However, mPLMs necessitate substantial resources and incur high computational costs during inference, posing challenges for deployment in real-world and real-time systems. Existing model cascade methods seek to enhance inference efficiency by greedily selecting the lightest model capable of processing the current input from a variety of models, based on model confidence scores. Nonetheless, deep models tend to exhibit overconfidence, and confidence distributions vary across languages. This leads to the emission of confident but incorrect predictions by smaller models, hindering their ability to generalize effectively across test languages. In this study, we introduce a confidence calibration model cascade ($C^3$) method. This approach, simple yet effective, involves calibration prior to cascade inference, thereby enhancing cascade accuracy through more reliable predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on three cross-lingual benchmarks demonstrate that $C^3$ significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines.",

            "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as formidable tools, showing their strong capability in handling various open-vocabulary tasks in image recognition, text-driven visual content generation, and visual chatbots, to name a few. In recent years, considerable efforts and resources have been devoted to adaptation methods for improving downstream performance of VLMs, particularly on parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like prompt learning. However, a crucial aspect that has been largely overlooked is the confidence calibration problem in fine-tuned VLMs, which could greatly reduce reliability when deploying such models in the real world. This paper bridges the gap by systematically investigating the confidence calibration problem in the context of prompt learning and reveals that existing calibration methods are insufficient to address the problem, especially in the open-vocabulary setting. To solve the problem, we present a simple and effective approach called Distance-Aware Calibration (DAC), which is based on scaling the temperature using as guidance the distance between predicted text labels and base classes. The experiments with 7 distinct prompt learning methods applied across 11 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAC, which achieves high efficacy without sacrificing the inference speed.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies introduced effective compression techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs) via post-training quantization or low-bit weight representation. Although quantized weights offer storage efficiency and allow for faster inference, existing works have indicated that quantization might compromise performance and exacerbate biases in LLMs. This study investigates the confidence and calibration of quantized models, considering factors such as language model type and scale as contributors to quantization loss. Firstly, we reveal that quantization with GPTQ to 4-bit results in a decrease in confidence regarding true labels, with varying impacts observed among different language models. Secondly, we observe fluctuations in the impact on confidence across different scales. Finally, we propose an explanation for quantization loss based on confidence levels, indicating that quantization disproportionately affects samples where the full model exhibited low confidence levels in the first place.",

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide, prompting governments to allocate substantial resources toward public health spendings (PHS). However, the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have raised questions about the effectiveness and sustainability of such expenditures. This research analyzes the nonlinear link between pandemic uncertainty (PNU) and PHS in countries with highest PNU (USA, India, France, Germany, UK, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan, and China). Previous studies have employed panel data methodologies to establish consistent findings regarding the relationship between pandemics and health spendings, regardless of the fact that several countries have not autonomously recognized this connection. In contrast, this current research adopts a distinctive tool called \"quantile-on-quantile,\" which enables the examination of time series dependency within each economy, providing both international and country-specific perspectives on the relationship between the variables. The estimations indicate that PNU leads to an increase in PHS in the vast majority of economies chosen by us, focusing on definite segments of the data distribution. Moreover, the data demonstrates that there are differences in the asymmetry between the variables across various nations. This underscores the need for policymakers to take careful deliberation when formulating policies related to health spendings and addressing the challenges posed by pandemic uncertainty.",
