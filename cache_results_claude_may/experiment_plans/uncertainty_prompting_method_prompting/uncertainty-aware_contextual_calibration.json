        "Problem": "Large language models often struggle to accurately estimate their uncertainty across different contexts and domains, leading to miscalibrated confidence estimates that do not reflect the model's true capabilities.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches to calibrating LLMs include temperature scaling, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression. However, these methods often rely on a global calibration model and do not account for the varying levels of uncertainty across different contexts.",
        "Motivation": "By learning context-specific calibration models, we can capture the varying levels of uncertainty that an LLM may have across different domains and types of inputs. This approach is inspired by the observation that humans often have different levels of confidence depending on the context and their familiarity with the subject matter.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Uncertainty-Aware Contextual Calibration (UACC), a method that learns a set of context-specific calibration models to adjust the LLM's confidence estimates based on the input context. The context is determined by clustering the input examples based on their semantic similarity, using techniques such as k-means clustering or topic modeling. For each context cluster, a separate calibration model is learned using a small set of labeled examples. During inference, the input is first assigned to one of the context clusters, and the corresponding calibration model is applied to adjust the LLM's confidence estimates.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate UACC on a diverse set of tasks spanning multiple domains, such as question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. Compare the calibration performance of UACC with baseline methods such as temperature scaling and Platt scaling, using metrics such as expected calibration error and maximum calibration error. Analyze the learned context clusters and calibration models to gain insights into the varying levels of uncertainty across different contexts."

The context is determined by clustering the input examples based on their semantic similarity, using techniques such as k-means clustering or topic modeling.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Collect diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, such as question answering (e.g., SQuAD, TriviaQA), natural language inference (e.g., MNLI, SNLI), and sentiment analysis (e.g., SST-2, IMDB). For each dataset, split it into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: Implement Baseline Methods": "Implement baseline calibration methods, including temperature scaling, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression. Train these methods on the train set of each dataset and evaluate their performance on the validation set using metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE) and maximum calibration error (MCE).",
            "Step 3: Implement UACC": "Implement the UACC method as follows:\n1. Cluster the input examples in the train set of each dataset based on their semantic similarity using techniques such as k-means clustering or topic modeling.\n2. For each context cluster, learn a separate calibration model (e.g., temperature scaling, Platt scaling, or isotonic regression) using a small set of labeled examples from that cluster.\n3. During inference, assign the input to one of the context clusters based on its semantic similarity to the cluster centroids.\n4. Apply the corresponding calibration model to adjust the LLM's confidence estimates for the input.",
            "Step 4: Evaluate UACC": "Evaluate the performance of UACC on the test set of each dataset using metrics such as ECE and MCE. Compare the results with the baseline methods implemented in Step 2.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Context Clusters": "Analyze the learned context clusters and calibration models to gain insights into the varying levels of uncertainty across different contexts. Visualize the clusters using techniques such as t-SNE or UMAP to understand the semantic structure of the input space.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of UACC, such as the clustering algorithm, the number of clusters, and the choice of calibration model for each cluster. Evaluate the performance of UACC with different configurations on the validation set of each dataset.",
            "Step 7: Cross-Domain Evaluation": "Evaluate the performance of UACC when the context clusters and calibration models are learned on one dataset and applied to another dataset from a different domain. This will help understand the generalizability of the learned context-specific calibration models.",
            "Step 8: Comparison with State-of-the-Art": "Compare the performance of UACC with state-of-the-art calibration methods, such as ensemble-based methods or Bayesian neural networks, on the test set of each dataset. Discuss the strengths and limitations of UACC compared to these methods."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Temperature Scaling)": "What is the capital of France?\nParis\nWhat is the capital of Italy?\nRome\nWhat is the capital of Germany?\nBerlin\nWhat is the capital of Spain?",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Temperature Scaling)": "Madrid\nConfidence: 0.85",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (UACC)": "What is the capital of France?\nParis\nWhat is the capital of Italy?\nRome\nWhat is the capital of Germany?\nBerlin\nWhat is the capital of Spain?",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (UACC)": "Madrid\nConfidence: 0.92",
            "Explanation": "In this example, the input question belongs to the context cluster of geography-related questions. UACC applies the calibration model learned specifically for this context cluster, which adjusts the confidence estimate to better reflect the model's certainty in answering geography-related questions. The temperature scaling method, on the other hand, applies a global calibration model that does not take into account the specific context of the input, resulting in a lower confidence estimate that may not accurately reflect the model's true capability in this domain."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UACC method does not outperform the baseline calibration methods, we can conduct additional analyses to understand the reasons behind its performance:\n1. Analyze the quality of the learned context clusters: Evaluate the coherence and separability of the clusters using metrics such as silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index. If the clusters are not well-separated or coherent, it may indicate that the clustering algorithm or the semantic similarity measure used is not suitable for the given datasets.\n2. Analyze the performance of individual calibration models: Evaluate the performance of each context-specific calibration model separately to identify which contexts are more challenging for calibration. This can provide insights into the limitations of the current calibration models and guide the development of more advanced models.\n3. Analyze the impact of the number of labeled examples per cluster: Vary the number of labeled examples used to learn each context-specific calibration model and evaluate its impact on the overall performance of UACC. If the performance improves with more labeled examples, it may indicate that the current setup is limited by the amount of labeled data available for each context.\n4. Analyze the transferability of the learned calibration models: Evaluate the performance of UACC when the context clusters and calibration models are learned on one dataset and applied to another dataset from the same domain. If the performance degrades significantly, it may indicate that the learned calibration models are overfitting to the specific characteristics of the training dataset and are not generalizable to other datasets within the same domain.\nBased on the insights gained from these analyses, we can propose alternative approaches to improve the performance of UACC, such as:\n1. Using more advanced clustering algorithms or semantic similarity measures to obtain better context clusters.\n2. Developing more sophisticated calibration models that can better capture the uncertainty within each context cluster.\n3. Incorporating transfer learning techniques to improve the generalizability of the learned calibration models across different datasets and domains.\n4. Exploring semi-supervised or unsupervised learning approaches to reduce the reliance on labeled examples for learning the context-specific calibration models.\nIf the performance of UACC remains unsatisfactory after these alternative approaches, we can still leverage the insights gained from the analyses to inform the development of new methods for calibrating LLMs. The project can be turned into an analysis paper that highlights the challenges and limitations of existing calibration methods and proposes new research directions based on the lessons learned from UACC."
