    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate overconfident responses, even when they are uncertain or lack sufficient knowledge. This can lead to the propagation of misinformation and reduced trust in LLM-based systems.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches for confidence calibration in LLMs include temperature scaling, ensemble methods, and post-processing techniques based on the model's output probabilities.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a novel prompting method inspired by Bayesian inference, which allows LLMs to express uncertainty and update their confidence based on the available evidence. By framing the problem in a Bayesian framework, we aim to improve the calibration of LLM confidence scores and enable more transparent and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our Bayesian Confidence Prompting (BCP) method consists of the following steps: 1) Prior Confidence Elicitation: Prompt the LLM to express its prior confidence in its ability to answer a given question, based on its general knowledge and understanding of the topic. 2) Evidence Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a set of relevant evidence statements that support or contradict its initial response. 3) Likelihood Estimation: For each evidence statement, prompt the LLM to estimate the likelihood of observing that evidence given its initial response. 4) Posterior Confidence Update: Prompt the LLM to update its confidence estimate based on the generated evidence and their likelihoods, using Bayes' theorem. The updated confidence should reflect the model's uncertainty and the strength of the supporting evidence. 5) Final Response Generation: Generate the final response, along with the updated confidence score and a summary of the supporting evidence.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the effectiveness of BCP on a diverse set of question-answering and fact verification datasets, comparing it against baseline confidence calibration methods. Measure the calibration of the generated confidence scores using metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log Likelihood (NLL). Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated evidence statements and their impact on the confidence updates. Conduct human evaluation to assess the interpretability and trustworthiness of the generated responses and confidence scores, and compare them to baseline methods."

        "Title": "Bayesian Confidence Prompting: Improving Uncertainty Quantification and Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate overconfident responses, even when they are uncertain or lack sufficient knowledge. This can lead to the propagation of misinformation and reduced trust in LLM-based systems.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches for confidence calibration in LLMs, such as temperature scaling, ensemble methods, and post-processing techniques based on the model's output probabilities, do not effectively capture the model's uncertainty or provide interpretable confidence scores. We propose a novel prompting method inspired by Bayesian inference, which allows LLMs to express uncertainty and update their confidence based on the available evidence. By framing the problem in a Bayesian framework, we aim to improve the calibration of LLM confidence scores and enable more transparent and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our Bayesian Confidence Prompting (BCP) method consists of the following steps:\n1. Prior Confidence Elicitation: Prompt the LLM to express its prior confidence in its ability to answer a given question, based on its general knowledge and understanding of the topic.\n2. Evidence Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a set of relevant evidence statements that support or contradict its initial response.\n3. Likelihood Estimation: For each evidence statement, prompt the LLM to estimate the likelihood of observing that evidence given its initial response.\n4. Posterior Confidence Update: Prompt the LLM to update its confidence estimate based on the generated evidence and their likelihoods, using Bayes' theorem. The updated confidence should reflect the model's uncertainty and the strength of the supporting evidence.\n5. Final Response Generation: Generate the final response, along with the updated confidence score and a summary of the supporting evidence.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Evaluate the effectiveness of BCP on a diverse set of question-answering and fact verification datasets, such as SQuAD, TriviaQA, FEVER, and Natural Questions. These datasets cover a wide range of domains and question types, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the method's performance.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Compare BCP against the following baseline confidence calibration methods:\n1. Temperature Scaling: Adjust the temperature parameter of the LLM's output distribution to calibrate the confidence scores.\n2. Ensemble Methods: Combine the predictions and confidence scores of multiple LLMs to improve calibration.\n3. Post-processing Techniques: Apply post-processing methods, such as Platt scaling or isotonic regression, to the model's output probabilities to obtain calibrated confidence scores.",
            "Step 3: Evaluation Metrics": "Measure the calibration of the generated confidence scores using the following metrics:\n1. Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Compute the average difference between the predicted confidence and the observed accuracy, binned by confidence levels.\n2. Negative Log Likelihood (NLL): Calculate the negative log likelihood of the true labels under the predicted confidence distribution.\n3. Brier Score: Compute the average squared difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels.",
            "Step 4: Evidence Quality Assessment": "Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated evidence statements and their impact on the confidence updates. Manually annotate a subset of the generated evidence statements for relevance and factual correctness. Compute the correlation between evidence quality and the magnitude of the confidence updates.",
            "Step 5: Human Evaluation": "Conduct a human evaluation to assess the interpretability and trustworthiness of the generated responses and confidence scores. Present human annotators with the generated responses, confidence scores, and supporting evidence from BCP and the baseline methods. Ask the annotators to rate the responses on a Likert scale for the following criteria:\n1. Interpretability: How well does the confidence score and supporting evidence justify the model's response?\n2. Trustworthiness: How much do you trust the model's response, given the confidence score and supporting evidence?\n3. Uncertainty Quantification: How well does the confidence score reflect the model's uncertainty in its response?",
            "Step 6: Prompt Engineering": "Develop a set of prompts for each step of the BCP method, ensuring that the prompts are clear, concise, and effective in eliciting the desired information from the LLM. Iterate on the prompt design based on the quality of the generated responses and the performance on the evaluation metrics.",
            "Step 7: Model Selection": "Experiment with different LLMs, such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and BERT-based models, to assess the effectiveness of BCP across various model architectures and sizes. Compare the performance of BCP on each model and analyze the impact of model size and pre-training data on the calibration of confidence scores.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of the BCP method to the overall performance. Experiment with the following variations:\n1. Removing the prior confidence elicitation step\n2. Varying the number of generated evidence statements\n3. Using different likelihood estimation techniques\n4. Comparing Bayesian updating with alternative confidence aggregation methods",
            "Step 9: Error Analysis": "Perform a detailed error analysis to identify the limitations and failure modes of the BCP method. Examine cases where the model generates incorrect or overconfident responses despite the Bayesian updating process. Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated evidence statements in these cases and propose potential improvements to the method.",
            "Step 10: Computational Efficiency": "Measure the computational overhead introduced by the BCP method compared to the baseline confidence calibration techniques. Analyze the trade-off between the improved calibration and the increased computational cost, and propose optimizations to improve the efficiency of the method."

This evidence also supports the claim, but there is a small possibility that Harper Lee wrote other novels under a pseudonym.\n3. Likelihood: 0.95. Winning the Pulitzer Prize for the novel strongly indicates that Harper Lee wrote it."

Canberra is explicitly stated to be the capital city of Australia.\n2. Sydney is the most populous city, but not the capital.\n3. The Australian Parliament is located in Canberra, further confirming its status as the capital."

                    "Explanation": "The BCP method enables the model to revise its initial incorrect response by generating and considering contradictory evidence.

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed BCP method does not significantly improve the calibration of confidence scores or the interpretability of the generated responses, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality and relevance of the generated evidence statements to identify potential weaknesses in the evidence generation step. Experiment with alternative prompting techniques or incorporate external knowledge sources to improve the quality of the evidence.\n2. Investigate the impact of different likelihood estimation techniques on the confidence updates. Explore alternative methods for estimating the likelihoods, such as using a separate model trained on a labeled dataset of evidence-claim pairs.\n3. Examine the limitations of the Bayesian updating process and consider alternative confidence aggregation methods, such as Dempster-Shafer theory or fuzzy logic, which may better capture the uncertainty and conflicting evidence.\n4. Conduct a more extensive error analysis to identify common patterns or factors that contribute to the failure of the BCP method. Use these insights to refine the prompting techniques, evidence generation process, or confidence updating algorithm.\n5. If the BCP method fails to provide significant improvements, focus on analyzing the generated evidence statements and the model's reasoning process. Treat the project as an exploratory study on the limitations of LLMs in expressing uncertainty and updating their beliefs based on evidence. Provide insights into the challenges of confidence calibration in LLMs and propose potential directions for future research."
