    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models can generate code snippets, but often lack the ability to provide clear explanations of how the code works, making it difficult for developers to understand and maintain the generated code.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for code generation focus primarily on generating functional code without considering the explanatory aspect.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to generate code explanations along with the code itself, we can improve the interpretability and maintainability of the generated code. The model can learn to provide high-level summaries, describe the purpose of each code block, and highlight key algorithmic steps.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Code Explanation Prompting (CEP) for code generation. CEP prompts the model to generate code along with corresponding explanations. The prompts are designed to elicit clear and concise explanations at different levels of granularity. For example, the model is prompted to provide a high-level summary of the code, explain the purpose of each function or class, and describe the key algorithmic steps. The generated explanations are presented as comments within the code. The model is trained to generate code and explanations jointly, ensuring consistency between the two.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CEP on code generation benchmarks and assess the quality of the generated explanations using human evaluation. Conduct a user study with developers to measure the usefulness and clarity of the explanations in aiding code understanding and maintenance. Compare CEP with baseline methods that generate code without explanations."

        "Title": "Code Explanation Prompting: Improving Code Generation Interpretability and Maintainability",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate code snippets, but often lack the ability to provide clear explanations of how the code works, making it difficult for developers to understand and maintain the generated code.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We evaluate CEP on code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval, APPS, and CodeContests. These datasets contain programming problems with test cases and ground-truth solutions.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We design prompts for CEP that encourage the model to generate code explanations at different levels of granularity. The prompts include instructions like:\n- Provide a high-level summary of the code\n- Explain the purpose of each function or class\n- Describe the key algorithmic steps\n- Include the explanations as comments within the code\nWe also include baseline prompts that only ask the model to generate code without explanations.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We experiment with state-of-the-art language models for code generation, such as Codex (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and PaLM-Coder.",
            "Step 4: Generate Code and Explanations": "For each problem in the datasets, we prompt the models using both CEP and baseline prompts to generate code solutions. We collect the generated code and explanations for evaluation.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Code Quality": "We assess the quality of the generated code using the following metrics:\n- Functional correctness: We run the generated code against the test cases provided in the datasets and measure the pass rate.\n- Code readability: We use code readability metrics such as cyclomatic complexity and lines of code to evaluate the readability of the generated code.",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Explanation Quality": "We conduct a human evaluation to assess the quality of the generated explanations. We recruit experienced developers to rate the explanations based on the following criteria:\n- Clarity: Are the explanations clear and easy to understand?\n- Completeness: Do the explanations cover all the important aspects of the code?\n- Consistency: Are the explanations consistent with the generated code?\n- Usefulness: Do the explanations aid in understanding and maintaining the code?",
            "Step 7: Analyze Results": "We compare the performance of CEP with the baseline prompts in terms of code quality and explanation quality. We hypothesize that CEP will lead to more readable and maintainable code, as well as higher-quality explanations that aid in code understanding."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "Write a Python function to find the longest common subsequence between two strings.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    return dp[m][n]",
            "Proposed Prompt Input": "Write a Python function to find the longest common subsequence between two strings. Include explanations for each part of the code.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    # Find the lengths of the input strings\n    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)\n    \n    # Create a 2D DP table to store the lengths of LCS\n    # dp[i][j] represents the length of LCS between str1[:i] and str2[:j]\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Fill the DP table\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            # If the characters match, increase the length of LCS by 1\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            # If the characters don't match, take the maximum of the previous subproblems\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # Return the length of LCS\n    return dp[m][n]",
            "Explanation": "The proposed prompt encourages the model to generate code explanations along with the code itself. The explanations provide a high-level summary, describe the purpose of each code block, and highlight the key algorithmic steps. This makes the code more interpretable and maintainable compared to the baseline prompt, which only generates the code without explanations."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CEP method does not significantly improve code quality or explanation quality compared to the baselines, we can consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the generated explanations to identify common weaknesses or areas for improvement. This can inform the design of better prompts or fine-tuning strategies.\n2. Experiment with different prompt variations and fine-tuning techniques to optimize the generation of code explanations.\n3. Conduct a more in-depth human evaluation to gather qualitative feedback from developers on the usefulness and effectiveness of the generated explanations.\n4. Explore alternative approaches to improve code interpretability and maintainability, such as using code summarization techniques or integrating documentation generation into the code generation process."
