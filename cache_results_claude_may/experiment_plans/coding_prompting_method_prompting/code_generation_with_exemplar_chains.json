The exemplar chain serves as a scaffold that helps the model understand the high-level structure and relationships between different code components.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a code generation approach that utilizes exemplar chains to guide the generation process. The method involves the following steps:\n1. Construct a chain of exemplars that showcase the step-by-step construction of a complex code snippet, highlighting the key programming concepts and patterns involved.\n2. Prompt the model with the problem description and the exemplar chain.\n3. Generate the code by following the structure and patterns demonstrated in the exemplar chain, adapting them to the specific problem requirements.\n4. Iteratively refine the generated code by comparing it with the exemplar chain and making necessary adjustments.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We evaluate the proposed method on code generation tasks that require the generation of complex code snippets, such as implementing data structures or algorithms. We can use datasets like HumanEval, APPS, and CodeContests. These datasets contain problems with varying levels of complexity and cover a wide range of programming concepts.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each problem in the dataset, we construct an exemplar chain that demonstrates the step-by-step construction of a solution. The exemplar chain should highlight the key programming concepts and patterns involved in solving the problem. We can start with a simple example and gradually build up the complexity, showing how each step contributes to the final solution. The exemplar chain should be designed to guide the model towards generating code that follows a similar structure and incorporates the relevant concepts.\nFor the baseline, we use a single example or a few examples as the prompt, without the step-by-step construction.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We experiment with state-of-the-art language models like GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), GPT-4, and Codex. These models have shown strong performance in code generation tasks and can effectively leverage the provided exemplars.",
            "Step 4: Generate Code": "For each problem, we prompt the model with the problem description and the corresponding exemplar chain. The model should generate code that follows the structure and patterns demonstrated in the exemplar chain, adapting them to the specific problem requirements. We can generate multiple candidate solutions for each problem to assess the model's ability to generate diverse and correct code.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Generated Code": "We evaluate the generated code using both automated metrics and manual evaluation. For automated metrics, we can use pass@k, which measures the percentage of problems for which at least one of the generated solutions passes the test cases. We can also use BLEU score to measure the similarity between the generated code and the reference solutions. For manual evaluation, we can assess the generated code in terms of correctness, efficiency, and adherence to the exemplar chain structure.",
            "Step 6: Iterative Refinement": "To further improve the generated code, we can perform iterative refinement. We compare the generated code with the exemplar chain and identify any discrepancies or areas for improvement. Based on this analysis, we can make necessary adjustments to the generated code, such as fixing syntax errors, optimizing inefficient code segments, or incorporating missing programming concepts. We repeat this refinement process until the generated code closely matches the exemplar chain and meets the problem requirements.",
            "Step 7: Compare with Baselines": "We compare the performance of the proposed exemplar chain method with the baseline approaches that use a single example or a few examples as the prompt. We evaluate the methods on the same set of problems and compare the results in terms of pass@k, BLEU score, and manual evaluation metrics. This comparison will help us assess the effectiveness of using exemplar chains for guiding code generation."

                "Problem": "Implement a function to find the maximum subarray sum in a given array.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum. Example:\nInput: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum of 6.",

                "Exemplar Chain Prompt": "Let's solve the maximum subarray sum problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Initialize variables\n- Initialize a variable `max_sum` to keep track of the maximum sum found so far. Set it to negative infinity.\n- Initialize a variable `current_sum` to keep track of the current subarray sum. Set it to 0.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through the array\n- For each number `num` in the array:\n  - Update `current_sum` by taking the maximum of `num` and `current_sum + num`.\n  - Update `max_sum` by taking the maximum of `max_sum` and `current_sum`.\n\nStep 3: Return the result\n- After the loop ends, `max_sum` will hold the maximum subarray sum.\n- Return `max_sum`.\n\nNow, implement the solution based on the above steps.",

It breaks down the solution into initializing variables, iterating through the array, and updating the maximum sum. The generated code closely follows the structure and logic outlined in the exemplar chain, resulting in a correct and efficient implementation."

            "Example 2": {
                "Problem": "Implement a function to perform breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph represented using an adjacency list.",

Initialize it with the starting node.\n- Create a list `result` to store the order in which the nodes are visited.\n\nStep 2: Perform BFS\n- While the `queue` is not empty:\n  - Dequeue a node from the `queue` and assign it to `node`.\n  - If `node` has not been visited:\n    - Add `node` to the `visited` set.\n    - Append `node` to the `result` list.\n    - Enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of `node` into the `queue`.\n\nStep 3: Return the result\n- After the loop ends, `result` will contain the order in which the nodes are visited.\n- Return `result`.\n\nNow, implement the BFS function based on the above steps.",

                "Explanation": "The exemplar chain breaks down the BFS algorithm into clear steps, guiding the model to initialize the necessary data structures, perform the BFS traversal, and return the result. The generated code follows the structure outlined in the exemplar chain, ensuring that the nodes are visited in the correct order and that the visited set is used to avoid revisiting nodes. The exemplar chain helps the model generate a correct and efficient implementation of BFS."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed exemplar chain method does not significantly outperform the baseline approaches, we can consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the generated code to identify common patterns or mistakes. This analysis can help us understand where the model struggles and inform potential improvements to the exemplar chains.\n2. Experiment with different formats and levels of detail in the exemplar chains. We can vary the granularity of the steps, the amount of explanations provided, or the inclusion of additional examples to see if certain formats are more effective in guiding the model.\n3. Investigate the impact of the quality and diversity of the exemplar chains on the generated code. We can curate a set of high-quality exemplar chains that cover a wide range of programming concepts and patterns and evaluate their effectiveness in improving code generation.\n4. Explore the use of additional techniques, such as reinforcement learning or iterative refinement, in combination with exemplar chains. These techniques can help the model learn to generate code that better aligns with the exemplar chains and meets the problem requirements.\n5. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify the types of errors made by the model and their frequencies. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the current approach and guide future research directions.\nBy incorporating these alternative plans, we can gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the exemplar chain method and identify potential avenues for improvement. Even if the initial results do not meet the success criteria, the insights gained from these analyses can inform the development of more effective code generation techniques."
