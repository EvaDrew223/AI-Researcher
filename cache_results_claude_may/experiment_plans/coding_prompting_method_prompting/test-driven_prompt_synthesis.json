        "Problem": "Ensuring the correctness and reliability of generated code is a significant challenge in code generation tasks. Incorporating test cases and test-driven development principles into the code generation process could help improve the quality and robustness of the generated code.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current code generation approaches often rely on a single prompt or a few examples to guide the model, without explicitly considering test cases or code correctness.",
        "Motivation": "By generating code that is explicitly guided by test cases, the model can learn to produce code that is more likely to be correct, reliable, and aligned with the desired functionality. Test-driven prompt synthesis can help catch and prevent common errors, edge cases, and inconsistencies in the generated code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a Test-Driven Prompt Synthesis (TDPS) method for code generation. The process involves the following steps: 1) Test Case Generation: Given a problem description, the model is prompted to generate a comprehensive set of test cases that cover various scenarios, edge cases, and potential errors. 2) Test-Guided Code Generation: The model is prompted to generate code that specifically aims to pass the generated test cases. The prompt includes both the problem description and the test cases, guiding the model to generate code that satisfies the test requirements. 3) Iterative Refinement: The generated code is executed against the test cases, and any failing tests are used as feedback to prompt the model to refine the code. This iterative process continues until all test cases pass or a maximum number of iterations is reached.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TDPS on a range of programming problems from various domains and compare its performance with baseline code generation methods. Measure the correctness and reliability of the generated code using metrics such as test case pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing. Analyze the effectiveness of the generated test cases in guiding the code generation process and catching potential errors. Assess the quality and maintainability of the generated code through manual review and static code analysis."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed TDPS method does not significantly outperform the baseline methods, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated test cases to identify any gaps or limitations in coverage. Refine the test case generation prompts to address these gaps and ensure comprehensive coverage of scenarios and edge cases.\n2. Investigate the quality and relevance of the generated test cases. Assess whether the test cases are meaningful, coherent, and aligned with the problem requirements. Adjust the test case generation prompts to improve the quality and relevance of the test cases.\n3. Examine the iterative refinement process and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Consider alternative strategies for incorporating feedback from failing test cases, such as using more targeted prompts or employing reinforcement learning techniques to guide the refinement process.\n4. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to understand the common types of errors and inconsistencies in the generated code. Use this analysis to inform prompt engineering and develop targeted strategies to address specific error patterns.\n5. Explore the integration of additional code quality metrics and static code analysis tools into the evaluation process. These metrics can provide insights into the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of the generated code, guiding further improvements in the TDPS framework.\n6. Consider incorporating domain-specific knowledge and constraints into the prompts to guide the code generation process. This can involve including relevant libraries, design patterns, or best practices specific to the programming domain.\nIf the TDPS method still does not yield satisfactory results after exploring these alternative approaches, the project can be adapted into an analysis paper. The analysis can focus on understanding the limitations and challenges of test-driven code generation using large language models. The insights gained from the experiments and error analysis can be used to propose future directions and improvements in the field of code generation and prompt engineering."
