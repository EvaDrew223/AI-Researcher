        "Problem": "Generating high-quality code from natural language descriptions remains challenging for large language models, especially for complex programming tasks that require domain-specific knowledge and best practices.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches often rely on direct prompting with few-shot examples or fine-tuning on large datasets of code-description pairs. Benchmarks like APPS and HumanEval are commonly used for evaluation.",
        "Motivation": "Humans often learn to write complex code by studying analogous examples and adapting them to new problem contexts. We hypothesize that prompting LLMs to recall relevant code examples and explain analogical mappings could guide them to generate higher-quality code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Analogical Code Generation Prompting, where given a natural language task description, we first prompt the LLM to retrieve the most analogous code examples from its training data, along with explanations of the relevant mappings and adaptations. The model then generates code for the target task by following these mappings and adaptations. We use a two-stage prompting approach: 1) Analogy Retrieval Prompt to find relevant examples and mappings, and 2) Code Generation Prompt that incorporates the retrieved analogies and mappings.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our approach on the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks, comparing to baselines of direct prompting and fine-tuning. We will measure pass@k rates and code quality metrics like time/space complexity. We will also conduct ablations to measure the impact of different prompt designs and analogy selection strategies."

        "Problem Statement": "Generating high-quality code from natural language descriptions remains challenging for large language models, especially for complex programming tasks that require domain-specific knowledge and best practices.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches for code generation with LLMs often rely on direct prompting with few-shot examples or fine-tuning on large datasets of code-description pairs. However, these methods may struggle to generate high-quality code for complex tasks that require adapting relevant knowledge and examples. Humans often learn to write complex code by studying analogous examples and adapting them to new problem contexts. We hypothesize that prompting LLMs to recall relevant code examples and explain analogical mappings could guide them to generate higher-quality code by leveraging their knowledge more effectively.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Analogical Code Generation Prompting, a two-stage prompting approach for code generation. Given a natural language description of a programming task, we first prompt the LLM to retrieve the most analogous code examples from its training data, along with explanations of the relevant mappings and adaptations. Then, we prompt the model to generate code for the target task by following these mappings and adaptations. The key steps are:\n1. Analogy Retrieval Prompt: Given a task description, prompt the LLM to retrieve relevant code examples and explain the analogical mappings and adaptations.\n2. Code Generation Prompt: Given the retrieved examples and analogical mappings, prompt the LLM to generate code for the target task by following the mappings and adaptations.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate the proposed approach on two code generation benchmarks: APPS and HumanEval. APPS contains 10,000 coding problems with test cases. HumanEval contains 164 hand-written programming problems with test cases. Both datasets have been used to evaluate code generation models. We will use pass@k as the main metric (i.e., the fraction of problems for which at least one of the k generated samples passes all test cases), as well as other code quality metrics like time complexity and readability.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For baselines, we use direct prompting (i.e., prompt with the task description) and few-shot prompting (i.e., include a few code examples in the prompt). For the proposed method, we design two prompts:\n1. Analogy Retrieval Prompt: \"Task: [task description]\nRetrieve the 3 most relevant code examples from your knowledge, and for each example, explain the analogical mappings and adaptations needed to solve the current task.\"\n2. Code Generation Prompt: \"Task: [task description]\nRelevant examples and analogical mappings:\n[retrieved examples and mappings]\nGenerate code to solve the task by adapting the relevant examples:\"\nWe will experiment with different prompt variations and see how they impact performance.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Evaluate the proposed approach on both GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 via the OpenAI API. We will compare the results to see how model size and capability impact the effectiveness of analogical prompting.",
            "Step 4: Run Experiments": "For each task in the evaluation datasets, prompt the models using the baseline and proposed prompts to generate code. For each generated code sample, run the provided test cases to compute the pass@k metric. Also compute other code quality metrics like time complexity and readability. Aggregate the results across all tasks.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of the proposed analogical prompting approach to the baselines. Analyze how retrieving and adapting relevant examples impacts the pass@k rate and code quality. Also analyze the retrieved examples and analogical mappings to gain insights into how the model is leveraging its knowledge. Conduct ablation studies to measure the impact of different prompt designs and analogy selection strategies."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed analogical prompting approach does not outperform the baselines, we can conduct additional analysis to understand why. Some ideas:\n1. Analyze the quality and relevance of the retrieved examples and analogical mappings. If the retrieved examples are not relevant or the mappings are not accurate, the model may not be able to adapt them effectively. We can experiment with different analogy retrieval prompts and selection strategies.\n2. Analyze the generated code samples to identify common errors or patterns. This can provide insights into where the model is struggling and how we can improve the prompts or analogy selection.\n3. Conduct ablation studies to measure the impact of different components of the proposed approach, such as the analogy retrieval prompt, the code generation prompt, and the analogy selection strategy. This can help identify which components are most important and where we should focus our efforts.\n4. Experiment with different model sizes and architectures to see if the effectiveness of analogical prompting varies across models. If the proposed approach works better on certain models, we can investigate why and potentially adapt the prompts accordingly.\n5. If the proposed approach still does not show promising results after these analyses, we can pivot the project to focus on understanding the limitations and challenges of analogical reasoning in large language models for code generation. This can involve conducting more targeted experiments and analyses to gain insights into how the models are using (or failing to use) analogies and how we can potentially improve their analogical reasoning capabilities."
