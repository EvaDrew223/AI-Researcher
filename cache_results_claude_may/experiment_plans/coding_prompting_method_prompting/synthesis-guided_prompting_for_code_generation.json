        "Problem": "Large language models struggle with generating complex code that satisfies multiple constraints and passes rigorous test cases.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for code generation typically rely on few-shot prompting with examples or fine-tuning on code datasets. However, these approaches often fail to generate code that passes all test cases, especially for complex problems with multiple constraints.",
        "Motivation": "Program synthesis techniques have shown promise in generating correct code by systematically searching the space of possible programs guided by specifications. We propose to integrate program synthesis ideas into the prompting process to guide the language model to generate code that satisfies the given constraints and passes the test cases.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Synthesis-Guided Prompting (SGP) for code generation. Given a coding problem, we first automatically generate a high-level sketch of the solution that captures the key algorithmic insights. Then, we prompt the language model with this sketch, asking it to fill in the missing details to obtain the complete code. The model is also prompted with the constraints and test cases, and asked to verify the generated code against them. If the code fails any test cases, the model is prompted to identify the bug, fix it, and re-verify in an iterative refinement process until the code passes all tests. The key idea is to use the synthesized sketch to guide the generation process, and the constraints and tests to drive the refinement process towards correct code.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate SGP on various competitive programming and coding interview problem benchmarks that involve complex algorithms and data structures. We will compare our approach with standard few-shot prompting and fine-tuning baselines, as well as program synthesis methods. The key evaluation metrics will be the percentage of problems solved (i.e., generated code passes all test cases), as well as the quality and efficiency of the generated code."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate SGP on various competitive programming and coding interview problem benchmarks that involve complex algorithms and data structures, such as LeetCode, CodeForces, and AtCoder. These datasets contain problems with test cases and constraints. We will also include the APPS dataset which has a large number of problems with test cases.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We will compare our approach with several baselines: (1) direct prompting: directly prompt the model with the problem description; (2) few-shot prompting: include a few examples of problems and their solutions in the prompt; (3) constrained few-shot prompting: include examples and also the constraints and test cases in the prompt, asking the model to generate code that satisfies them.\nFor our proposed SGP method, we will first prompt Codex to generate a high-level sketch of the solution given the problem description. The prompt will be designed to encourage Codex to focus on the key algorithmic insights and leave out low-level details. For example, we can use prompts like 'Generate a high-level plan for solving this problem, focusing on the key ideas and leaving out implementation details:'. Then, we will prompt the model with this sketch, the constraints, and the test cases, asking it to fill in the details to generate the complete code. We will also ask the model to verify the generated code against the test cases. If it fails any test case, we will prompt the model to identify the bug ('The code failed test case X. Identify the bug:'), fix it ('Fix the identified bug in the code:'), and re-verify ('Verify the fixed code against all test cases:'). We will repeat this refinement process until the code passes all test cases or reaches a maximum number of iterations.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use the Codex model (code-davinci-002) which is specialized for code generation. We will compare the performance of different model sizes.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "We will generate code solutions for the problems in the selected datasets using the baseline methods and our proposed SGP method. For each problem, we will check if the generated code passes all the test cases.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will compare the percentage of problems solved (i.e., generated code passes all test cases) by each method. We will also measure the average number of refinement iterations needed by SGP to generate correct code. Additionally, we will analyze the quality and efficiency of the generated code in terms of metrics like code length, execution time, and memory usage. We will perform statistical significance tests to check if the improvements by SGP are significant."

Analyze the quality of the generated sketches. Are they capturing the key algorithmic insights? Are they too high-level or too low-level? We can experiment with different prompts for generating sketches to find the right level of abstraction.\n2. Analyze the refinement process. How many iterations does it typically take to generate correct code? Where does the process get stuck? We can look into alternative prompts for bug identification and fixing to make the refinement more effective.\n3. Investigate the types of problems where SGP performs well or poorly. Does it handle certain types of algorithms or data structures better than others? This can give us insights into the strengths and limitations of the approach.\n4. Experiment with alternative program synthesis techniques for generating sketches or guiding the refinement process. We can draw inspiration from the program synthesis literature to improve the method.\nIf SGP still does not show promising results after these investigations, we can pivot the project to an analysis of the challenges in integrating program synthesis ideas into large language models for code generation. The insights gained from the experiments can inform future research directions in this area."
