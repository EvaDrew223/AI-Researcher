        "Problem": "Code generation often requires understanding the context in which the code will be used, such as the surrounding code, dependencies, and project structure. Current approaches often generate code in isolation, without considering the broader context, leading to code that may not integrate well with the existing codebase.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing code generation methods typically focus on generating code based on the provided prompt or examples, without explicitly considering the surrounding code context or project structure.",
        "Motivation": "By incorporating contextual information into the code generation process, we can guide the model to generate code that is more compatible with the existing codebase and follows the project's coding conventions and best practices. The contextual reasoning step allows the model to analyze the surrounding code, understand the dependencies and interfaces, and generate code that seamlessly integrates with the existing project structure.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a code generation approach that incorporates contextual reasoning. The method involves the following steps: 1) Prompt the model with the problem description and the relevant context, such as the surrounding code, dependencies, and project structure. 2) Guide the model to analyze the context and extract relevant information, such as function signatures, variable names, and coding patterns. 3) Generate code that integrates with the existing codebase by leveraging the extracted contextual information. 4) Validate the generated code against the context to ensure compatibility and adherence to project conventions. 5) Refine the generated code based on the validation results and user feedback.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on code generation tasks that require integration with an existing codebase or project structure. Compare the performance with baselines that generate code without considering the context. Assess the compatibility and integration of the generated code with the existing codebase. Measure the adherence to project conventions and best practices. Gather feedback from developers on the usefulness and effectiveness of the contextual reasoning approach in real-world development scenarios."

            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Choose a dataset that contains code generation tasks with accompanying contextual information, such as the surrounding code, dependencies, and project structure. Datasets like CodeSearchNet, CodeXGLUE, or a custom dataset collected from open-source projects can be used.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement baseline code generation methods that do not explicitly consider the context, such as:\n1. Direct prompting: Provide only the problem description as input to the model.\n2. Example-based prompting: Provide the problem description along with a few examples of similar code snippets.",
            "Step 3: Contextual Reasoning Method": "Implement the proposed contextual reasoning method:\n1. Prompt the model with the problem description and the relevant context.\n2. Guide the model to analyze the context and extract relevant information using prompts like:\n   - Identify the relevant functions and their signatures from the surrounding code.\n   - Extract the variable names and data types used in the existing codebase.\n   - Determine the coding conventions and patterns followed in the project.\n3. Generate code that integrates with the existing codebase by incorporating the extracted contextual information.\n4.

            "Step 8: Comparison and Analysis": "Compare the performance of the proposed contextual reasoning method with the baseline methods. Analyze the strengths and limitations of each approach and identify areas for further improvement."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed contextual reasoning method does not yield significant improvements over the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the quality and relevance of the extracted contextual information. Investigate whether the model is capturing the most important aspects of the context and adjust the prompts and guidance accordingly.\n2. Experiment with different code validation and refinement strategies. Explore alternative techniques for assessing code compatibility and adherence to conventions, such as static code analysis tools or custom validation rules.\n3. Collect more diverse and representative code generation tasks and accompanying contextual information. Ensure that the dataset covers a wide range of programming languages, project structures, and coding conventions.\n4. Investigate the impact of fine-tuning the language models on a larger corpus of code-related data. Fine-tuning on a domain-specific dataset may improve the model's understanding of code semantics and context.\n5. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify common failure modes and challenges in contextual code generation. Use the insights gained from the analysis to refine the proposed method or develop new approaches.\n6. If the contextual reasoning method does not yield practical improvements, focus on analyzing the limitations and challenges of incorporating context in code generation. Turn the project into an analysis paper that provides insights into the factors affecting the effectiveness of contextual code generation and proposes future research directions."
