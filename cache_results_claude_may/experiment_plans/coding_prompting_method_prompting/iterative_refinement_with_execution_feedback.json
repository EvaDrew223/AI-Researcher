        "Problem": "Code generated by large language models often contains errors or inefficiencies that can only be identified through execution. Incorporating execution feedback into the generation process could help improve the correctness and efficiency of the generated code.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for code generation typically rely on a single-pass generation process, without considering the execution behavior of the generated code.",
        "Motivation": "By iteratively refining the generated code based on execution feedback, the model can learn to identify and correct errors, optimize inefficiencies, and improve the overall quality of the generated code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an Iterative Refinement with Execution Feedback (IREF) method for code generation. The process involves multiple rounds of code generation and refinement: 1) Initial Code Generation: The model generates an initial version of the code based on the given prompt. 2) Execution and Feedback: The generated code is executed on a set of test cases, and the execution results (e.g., outputs, error messages, time/space complexity) are collected as feedback. 3) Code Refinement: The model is prompted to refine the generated code based on the execution feedback, focusing on correcting errors, optimizing inefficiencies, and improving code quality. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a satisfactory solution is obtained or a maximum number of iterations is reached.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate IREF on a diverse set of programming problems from various domains (e.g., algorithms, data structures, machine learning) and compare its performance with baseline methods. Measure the correctness, efficiency, and quality of the generated code using metrics such as pass rate, time/space complexity, and code readability. Analyze the effectiveness of the iterative refinement process in improving the generated code over multiple iterations."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Collect a diverse set of programming problems from various domains (e.g., algorithms, data structures, machine learning). The problems should cover a range of difficulty levels and include test cases for evaluating the generated code. Datasets such as LeetCode, CodeChef, and Codeforces can be used.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each programming problem, create a prompt that includes the problem statement, input/output format, and any additional constraints. The prompt should be clear and concise, providing all the necessary information for the model to generate a solution.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Choose large language models that have been pre-trained on code generation tasks, such as Codex, GPT-3, or other code-specific models. Fine-tune these models on the collected programming problems to improve their performance on the specific domains.",
            "Step 4: Implement IREF": "Implement the Iterative Refinement with Execution Feedback (IREF) method as follows:\n1) Initial Code Generation: Prompt the model with the programming problem and generate an initial version of the code.\n2) Execution and Feedback: Execute the generated code on the provided test cases and collect the execution results, including outputs, error messages, and performance metrics (e.g., time/space complexity).\n3) Code Refinement: Prompt the model to refine the generated code based on the execution feedback. The prompt should include the original problem statement, the generated code, and the execution feedback. The model should focus on correcting errors, optimizing inefficiencies, and improving code quality.\n4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a satisfactory solution is obtained or a maximum number of iterations is reached.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Performance": "Evaluate the performance of IREF by comparing it with baseline methods, such as single-pass code generation without execution feedback. Measure the correctness, efficiency, and quality of the generated code using metrics such as:\n- Pass rate: The percentage of test cases passed by the generated code.\n- Time/space complexity: The time and space complexity of the generated code compared to the optimal solution.\n- Code readability: Assess the readability and maintainability of the generated code using code quality metrics or human evaluation.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of IREF in improving code generation. Compare the performance of IREF with the baseline methods and assess the impact of iterative refinement and execution feedback on the quality of the generated code. Identify any limitations or challenges encountered during the experiments."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed IREF method does not significantly improve the quality of the generated code compared to the baseline methods, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the execution feedback to identify common patterns or types of errors in the generated code. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the current approach and guide the development of alternative methods.\n2. Experiment with different prompting strategies for code refinement. Instead of providing the entire execution feedback, try summarizing the key issues or providing more targeted guidance to the model during the refinement step.\n3. Explore alternative feedback mechanisms beyond execution results. Consider incorporating static code analysis, code quality metrics, or human feedback to provide additional signals for code refinement.\n4. Investigate the impact of model size and pre-training data on the effectiveness of IREF. Experiment with larger models or models specifically trained on code generation tasks to see if they yield better results.\n5. Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component in the IREF method. Evaluate the performance of code generation with and without execution feedback, iterative refinement, or specific prompting techniques.\nIf the IREF method does not yield satisfactory results after exploring these alternatives, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the challenges and limitations of incorporating execution feedback into code generation. The insights gained from this analysis can inform future research directions and the development of more effective methods for improving code generation quality."
