    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Code review is an essential process in software development to ensure code quality and maintainability. However, performing code reviews is time-consuming and requires expertise in the programming language and domain. Large language models can assist in the code review process, but their suggestions often lack the context and rationale behind the changes.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning the language model on a large corpus of code reviews and their corresponding changes. However, these approaches often generate generic comments and suggestions that lack the specific context and reasoning behind the changes.",
        "Motivation": "Effective code review requires collaboration and communication between the reviewer and the code author. By engaging the language model in a collaborative prompting process, we can generate more contextual and informative code review suggestions.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a collaborative prompting approach for code review. Given a code change and its corresponding description, we prompt the model to generate code review suggestions in a conversational manner. The prompts encourage the model to ask clarifying questions, provide rationale for the suggested changes, and engage in a dialogue with the code author. The code author can provide feedback and additional context, which is then used to refine the code review suggestions. The collaborative prompting process continues until a satisfactory code review is achieved. The generated code review suggestions are accompanied by explanations and references to coding best practices and standards.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code review datasets, such as the Code Review Open Platform (CROP) dataset. We will compare the performance with baselines such as fine-tuning approaches and rule-based code review tools. The generated code review suggestions will be evaluated based on relevance, clarity, and usefulness. We will conduct user studies with developers to assess the effectiveness of the collaborative prompting in real-world code review scenarios. The user studies will gather feedback on the quality and helpfulness of the generated code review suggestions and the overall user experience of the collaborative code review process."

        "Problem Statement": "Code review is an essential process in software development to ensure code quality and maintainability. However, performing code reviews is time-consuming and requires expertise in the programming language and domain. Large language models can assist in the code review process, but their suggestions often lack the context and rationale behind the changes.",

The generated code review suggestions are accompanied by explanations and references to coding best practices and standards.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the Code Review Open Platform (CROP) dataset, which contains code changes and their corresponding code reviews from various open-source projects. We will preprocess the dataset to extract the code changes, code review comments, and any available contextual information (e.g., commit messages, issue descriptions).",
            "Step 2: Baseline Models": "We will compare the proposed collaborative prompting approach with the following baselines:\n1. Fine-tuned model: We will fine-tune a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3, CodeBERT) on the CROP dataset using the code changes and their corresponding code review comments.\n2. Rule-based code review tool: We will use a popular rule-based code review tool (e.g., SonarQube, PMD) to generate code review suggestions based on predefined rules and best practices.",
            "Step 3: Collaborative Prompting": "We will design a set of prompts to guide the language model in generating contextual code review suggestions. The prompts will include:\n1. Initial prompt: Given a code change and its description, the model will be prompted to generate an initial code review suggestion and ask clarifying questions if needed.\n2. Dialogue prompts: The model will be prompted to engage in a dialogue with the code author, asking for additional context, providing rationale for the suggested changes, and refining the suggestions based on the author's feedback.\n3. Explanation prompts: The model will be prompted to provide explanations for the suggested changes, referencing relevant coding best practices and standards.",
            "Step 4: Evaluation Metrics": "We will evaluate the generated code review suggestions using the following metrics:\n1. Relevance: We will manually assess the relevance of the generated suggestions to the given code change and its context.\n2. Clarity: We will evaluate the clarity and understandability of the generated suggestions and explanations.\n3. Usefulness: We will assess the usefulness of the generated suggestions in improving code quality and maintainability.",
            "Step 5: User Study": "We will conduct a user study with experienced developers to assess the effectiveness of the collaborative prompting approach in real-world code review scenarios. The study will involve the following steps:\n1. Participants will be presented with code changes and their corresponding descriptions.\n2. Participants will use the collaborative prompting system to generate code review suggestions and engage in a dialogue with the model.\n3. Participants will provide feedback on the quality, relevance, and usefulness of the generated suggestions.\n4. Participants will compare the collaborative prompting approach with the baseline models and provide their preferences and opinions.",
            "Step 6: Result Analysis": "We will analyze the evaluation results and user study feedback to assess the effectiveness of the collaborative prompting approach. We will compare the performance of the proposed method with the baselines in terms of relevance, clarity, and usefulness of the generated code review suggestions. We will also analyze the user preferences and opinions to identify the strengths and limitations of the collaborative prompting approach."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Code Change": "def calculate_average(numbers):\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    return average",
                "Baseline Suggestion (Fine-tuned Model)": "- Use meaningful variable names\n- Add comments to explain the code\n- Consider handling empty input",
                "Baseline Suggestion (Rule-based Tool)": "- Function name should be in snake_case\n- Use a more descriptive function name\n- Handle potential ZeroDivisionError",
                "Collaborative Prompting": {
                    "Initial Prompt": "Given the code change:\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    return average\n```\nGenerate a code review suggestion and ask any clarifying questions if needed.",
                    "Initial Suggestion": "The code looks good and calculates the average correctly. However, I have a few suggestions and questions:\n1. What happens if the `numbers` list is empty? It would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Consider adding a check to handle empty input.\n2. The variable names `total` and `average` are a bit generic. Consider using more descriptive names like `sum_of_numbers` and `mean`.\n3. Adding a docstring to explain what the function does and what it expects as input would improve the code's readability.\nCan you provide more context on how this function will be used and what kind of input it expects?",
                    "Author Feedback": "Thanks for the suggestions! The function will be used to calculate the average of a list of numbers entered by the user. The input will always be a list of numeric values, but it could be empty if the user doesn't enter any values.",
                    "Refined Suggestion": "Based on the provided context, here are the updated suggestions:\n1. Add a check to handle empty input and return a appropriate message or value. For example:\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return 'No numbers provided'\n    sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)\n    mean = sum_of_numbers / len(numbers)\n    return mean\n```\n2. Use more descriptive variable names like `sum_of_numbers` and `mean` to improve readability.\n3. Add a docstring to explain the function's purpose and expected input. For example:\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the average (mean) of a list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numeric values.\n        \n    Returns:\n        float: The average (mean) of the numbers.\n        str: 'No numbers provided' if the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n```\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist with!",
                    "Explanation": "The refined suggestion addresses the potential `ZeroDivisionError` by adding a check for empty input and returning an appropriate message. It also uses more descriptive variable names and includes a docstring to improve the code's readability and maintainability. The explanation provides a clear rationale for the suggested changes and references best practices for error handling and code documentation."

            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Code Change": "def get_user_info(user_id):\n    user = db.get_user(user_id)\n    return {\n        'name': user.name,\n        'email': user.email,\n        'age': user.age\n    }",
                "Baseline Suggestion (Fine-tuned Model)": "- Add error handling for invalid user_id\n- Use a more descriptive function name\n- Consider using a dictionary comprehension",
                "Baseline Suggestion (Rule-based Tool)": "- Function name should be in snake_case\n- Use a more descriptive function name\n- Handle potential AttributeError",
                "Collaborative Prompting": {
                    "Initial Prompt": "Given the code change:\n```python\ndef get_user_info(user_id):\n    user = db.get_user(user_id)\n    return {\n        'name': user.name,\n        'email': user.email,\n        'age': user.age\n    }\n```\nGenerate a code review suggestion and ask any clarifying questions if needed.",
                    "Initial Suggestion": "The code retrieves user information based on the provided `user_id`, which looks fine. However, I have a few observations and questions:\n1. What happens if the `user_id` is invalid or not found in the database? The code assumes that `db.get_user(user_id)` always returns a valid user object. Consider adding error handling to deal with invalid or missing user IDs.\n2. The function name `get_user_info` is a bit generic. Consider using a more descriptive name that reflects the specific purpose of the function, such as `get_user_details_by_id`.\n3. The code explicitly returns a dictionary with the user's name, email, and age. Is there a reason for returning only these specific fields? Are there any other relevant user details that should be included?\nCan you provide more information about the `db` object and how it handles invalid user IDs? Also, are there any specific requirements or constraints regarding the user information that needs to be returned?",
                    "Author Feedback": "Thanks for the feedback! The `db` object is an instance of a custom database class that handles the database operations. If the `user_id` is invalid or not found, `db.get_user(user_id)` returns `None`. For now, we only need to return the user's name, email, and age, but in the future, we might need to include additional details.",
                    "Refined Suggestion": "Based on the provided information, here are the updated suggestions:\n1. Add error handling to deal with invalid or missing user IDs. You can check if the returned user object is `None` and raise an appropriate exception or return an error message. For example:\n```python\ndef get_user_details_by_id(user_id):\n    user = db.get_user(user_id)\n    if user is None:\n        raise ValueError(f\"User with ID {user_id} not found\")\n    return {\n        'name': user.name,\n        'email': user.email,\n        'age': user.age\n    }\n```\n2. Rename the function to `get_user_details_by_id` to make it more descriptive and indicate that it retrieves user details based on the provided ID.\n3. Since you mentioned that additional user details might be needed in the future, consider making the returned fields more flexible. You can use a dictionary comprehension to dynamically include fields based on a list of desired attributes. For example:\n```python\ndef get_user_details_by_id(user_id, fields=None):\n    user = db.get_user(user_id)\n    if user is None:\n        raise ValueError(f\"User with ID {user_id} not found\")\n    if fields is None:\n        fields = ['name', 'email', 'age']\n    return {field: getattr(user, field) for field in fields}\n```\nThis way, you can easily extend the function to include additional fields by passing them as a list to the `fields` parameter.\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist with!",
                    "Explanation": "The refined suggestion addresses the potential issue of invalid or missing user IDs by adding error handling. It raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message when the user is not found. The function name is updated to `get_user_details_by_id` to make it more descriptive and indicate its purpose. To make the returned user details more flexible and extensible, a dictionary comprehension is used to dynamically include fields based on a list of desired attributes. This allows for easy addition of new fields in the future without modifying the function's code. The explanation provides a clear rationale for the suggested changes and demonstrates how to handle potential errors and make the code more adaptable to future requirements."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed collaborative prompting approach does not yield satisfactory results, we can consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the generated code review suggestions to identify common patterns or limitations. This analysis can help us understand why the model might be struggling to provide contextual and informative suggestions. Based on the findings, we can refine the prompts or explore alternative prompting techniques.\n2. Investigate the impact of different language models on the quality of code review suggestions. We can experiment with other pre-trained models or fine-tune them on a larger dataset of code reviews to see if they perform better in capturing the context and generating relevant suggestions.\n3. Collect a larger dataset of code changes and their corresponding code reviews from diverse programming languages and domains. A more comprehensive dataset can help the model learn from a wider range of examples and improve its ability to generate contextual suggestions.\n4. Conduct a more in-depth user study to gather detailed feedback from developers on the strengths and weaknesses of the collaborative prompting approach. This feedback can provide valuable insights into the real-world applicability of the method and guide further improvements.\n5. Explore the integration of rule-based code analysis tools with the collaborative prompting approach. By combining the strengths of both techniques, we can potentially generate more comprehensive and accurate code review suggestions.\n6. If the collaborative prompting approach does not yield significant improvements over the baselines, we can focus on analyzing the limitations and challenges of generating contextual code review suggestions using large language models. This analysis can lead to valuable insights and contribute to the understanding of the current state of code review automation using AI techniques."
