        "Problem": "Large language models can generate code based on natural language descriptions, but the generated code may not always pass the necessary test cases, leading to inconsistencies and errors.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for code generation often rely on providing input-output examples or natural language descriptions, but do not explicitly incorporate test cases into the generation process.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model with test cases along with the task description, we can guide the model to generate code that is more robust and aligned with the desired behavior. The model can learn to consider edge cases, handle different input scenarios, and ensure the code passes the provided tests.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Test-Driven Prompting (TDP) for code generation. TDP prompts the model with a set of test cases along with the natural language description of the programming task. The test cases serve as additional constraints and provide examples of expected behavior. The model is prompted to generate code that not only satisfies the task description but also passes the given test cases. The prompts include instructions to consider the test cases during code generation and to iterate until all tests are passed. The generated code is automatically evaluated against the test cases to provide feedback to the model.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate TDP on code generation benchmarks that provide test cases, such as APPS and CodeContests. Measure the percentage of generated code that passes all the test cases. Compare TDP with baseline methods that do not incorporate test cases explicitly. Assess the quality and correctness of the generated code through human evaluation and manual code review."

        "Title": "Test-Driven Prompting: Improving Code Generation Robustness with Test Cases",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate code based on natural language descriptions, but the generated code may not always pass the necessary test cases, leading to inconsistencies and errors.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for code generation often rely on providing input-output examples or natural language descriptions, but do not explicitly incorporate test cases into the generation process.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate TDP on code generation benchmarks that provide test cases, such as APPS and CodeContests. These datasets contain programming problems with natural language descriptions and corresponding test cases.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "Design prompts for the baseline and TDP methods. The baseline prompt includes only the natural language description of the programming task. The TDP prompt includes the task description along with the test cases. The prompt should instruct the model to generate code that passes all the provided test cases. Example TDP prompt: 'Task: [problem description]\nTest Cases:\n[test case 1]\n[test case 2]\n...\nGenerate code that solves the task and passes all the test cases.'",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Use large language models with code generation capabilities, such as Codex (GPT-3), GPT-4, or other suitable models.",
            "Step 4: Generate Code": "For each programming problem in the datasets, generate code using both the baseline and TDP prompts. Record the generated code for evaluation.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Generated Code": "Evaluate the generated code against the provided test cases in the datasets. Measure the percentage of test cases passed by the generated code for both the baseline and TDP methods.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Results": "Compare the performance of the baseline and TDP methods in terms of the percentage of test cases passed. Assess if TDP leads to a higher percentage of generated code passing all test cases compared to the baseline. Perform statistical tests to determine the significance of the results.",
            "Step 7: Manual Code Review": "Randomly select a subset of the generated code samples from both the baseline and TDP methods. Conduct a manual code review to assess the quality, correctness, and adherence to best practices. Evaluate if TDP generates code that is more robust, handles edge cases better, and follows good coding practices compared to the baseline.",
            "Step 8: Iterate and Refine": "Based on the results and insights gained from the experiments, iterate and refine the TDP prompts. Experiment with different prompt variations, such as including more diverse test cases, providing additional instructions, or incorporating other relevant information. Repeat the experiments with the refined prompts to see if further improvements can be achieved."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Baseline Prompt Input": "Task: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.",
                "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "def sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    sum = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum += num\n    return sum",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method, Test-Driven Prompting, generates code that not only solves the task but also considers the provided test cases. It ensures that the generated code handles different input scenarios, including empty lists and negative numbers, and produces the expected output. The code is more concise and robust compared to the baseline.",
                "Proposed Prompt Input": "Task: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.\nTest Cases:\n1. Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Output: 6\n2. Input: [-2, 0, 2, 4], Output: 4\n3. Input: [], Output: 0\nGenerate code that solves the task and passes all the test cases.",
                "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "def sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)"
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Baseline Prompt Input": "Task: Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.",
                "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method generates code that handles the provided test cases. It considers case sensitivity by converting the string to lowercase and removes non-alphanumeric characters before checking for palindrome. The generated code is more robust and handles a wider range of input scenarios compared to the baseline.",
                "Proposed Prompt Input": "Task: Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.\nTest Cases:\n1. Input: \"racecar\", Output: True\n2. Input: \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\", Output: True\n3. Input: \"hello\", Output: False\nGenerate code that solves the task and passes all the test cases.",
                "Proposed Prompt Expected Output": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    s = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())\n    return s == s[::-1]"
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Test-Driven Prompting method does not yield significant improvements over the baseline, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated code to identify common patterns or mistakes. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the current prompting approach and guide further refinements.\n2. Experiment with different prompt variations, such as providing more granular test cases, including edge cases, or incorporating additional instructions or constraints in the prompts.\n3. Investigate the impact of model size and architecture on the effectiveness of Test-Driven Prompting. Experiment with different models or fine-tuning approaches to see if they respond better to the prompts.\n4. Collect human-generated code samples for the programming tasks and compare them with the model-generated code. Analyze the differences and identify areas where the model struggles. Use these insights to refine the prompts or develop new prompting strategies.\n5. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated code to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the Test-Driven Prompting approach. Identify common patterns, errors, or limitations, and use this information to guide further research and development of prompting techniques for code generation."
