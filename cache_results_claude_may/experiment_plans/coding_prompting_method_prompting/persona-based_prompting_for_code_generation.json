        "Problem": "LLMs can generate code that is functional but lacks consistency in style, documentation, and design choices. Different developers have different coding personas, and LLMs should be able to generate code that adheres to a specific persona.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing code generation methods focus on functional correctness and do not explicitly control for coding style or persona. Some methods use style transfer techniques to impose a specific style on the generated code.",
        "Motivation": "In real-world software development, code is often written by teams of developers, each with their own coding persona. Consistency in style, documentation, and design choices is important for code maintainability and readability. We propose to use persona-based prompting to generate code that adheres to a specific developer's persona.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Persona-Based Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to generate code as if it were a specific developer with a distinct coding persona. Specifically, we first define a set of coding personas, each with their own style guidelines, documentation practices, and design principles. For each coding problem, we randomly select a persona and provide it as additional context in the prompt. We then prompt the LLM to generate code that both solves the problem and adheres to the selected persona's guidelines. The key is to create diverse and realistic coding personas and to prompt the LLM to generate code that is consistent with the selected persona.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Persona-Based Prompting on a new benchmark of coding problems that require not just functional correctness but also adherence to specific style and design guidelines. We will compare with baselines like direct prompting and few-shot prompting without persona context. We will measure pass@k rates, code quality metrics, and adherence to persona guidelines. We will also perform a qualitative analysis of the generated code to assess its consistency with the selected personas."

        "Title": "Persona-Based Prompting: Generating Code with Consistent Style, Documentation, and Design",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code that is functional but lacks consistency in style, documentation, and design choices. Different developers have different coding personas, and LLMs should be able to generate code that adheres to a specific persona.",
        "Motivation": "Existing code generation methods focus on functional correctness and do not explicitly control for coding style or persona.

The key is to create diverse and realistic coding personas and to prompt the LLM to generate code that is consistent with the selected persona.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Define Coding Personas": "Create a diverse set of coding personas, each with specific characteristics such as coding style (e.g., variable naming conventions, indentation, line length limits), documentation practices (e.g., comment style, docstring format), and design principles (e.g., modular design, error handling). Example personas: 'Clean Code Cathy' (focuses on readable, modular code with descriptive names), 'Speedy Sam' (prefers concise, efficient code even at the cost of readability), 'Documented Dave' (writes extensive comments and docstrings), 'Pythonic Polly' (follows Python idioms and best practices).",
            "Step 2: Prepare Coding Problems": "Collect a set of coding problems from various domains (e.g., algorithms, data structures, web development) that can be solved in different programming languages. Ensure the problems have clear descriptions, input/output specifications, and test cases. Split the problems into train, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 3: Construct Prompts": "For each coding problem, randomly select a persona from the defined set. Construct a prompt that includes the problem description, input/output specifications, and the selected persona's characteristics. Example prompt: 'Solve the following coding problem as if you were [Persona Name]. Adhere to their coding style, documentation practices, and design principles. [Problem Description]'.",
            "Step 4: Generate Code": "Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) to generate code for each prompt. Generate multiple samples for each problem-persona pair to assess consistency. Experiment with different prompt formats, such as few-shot learning with example problem-persona pairs.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Generated Code": "Assess the generated code on three aspects: (1) Functional correctness: Run the code against the test cases to ensure it produces the expected output. (2) Adherence to persona: Manually review the code to check if it follows the selected persona's guidelines. Develop automated metrics for style consistency, documentation quality, and design principle adherence. (3) Consistency across samples: Compare multiple samples generated for the same problem-persona pair to evaluate consistency.",
            "Step 6: Baseline Comparison": "Compare the persona-based prompting approach with baseline methods, such as direct prompting (no persona) and few-shot prompting (with example problems but no persona). Evaluate the baselines on the same metrics as the proposed method.",
            "Step 7: Analyze Results": "Compute metrics such as pass@k rates (percentage of problems solved correctly within k attempts), style consistency scores, documentation quality scores, and design principle adherence scores. Compare the proposed method's performance with the baselines. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated code to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.",
            "Step 8: Ablation Studies": "Perform ablation experiments to understand the impact of different components, such as the number and diversity of personas, prompt format, and LLM size. Identify the key factors contributing to the method's performance."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Persona": "Clean Code Cathy",
                "Problem": "Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.",
                "Baseline Output": "def sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n  result = 0\n  for num in numbers:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n      result += num\n  return result",
                "Persona-Based Prompt": "Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list. Write the code as if you were 'Clean Code Cathy', focusing on readable, modular code with descriptive names.",
                "Persona-Based Output": "def sum_even_numbers(number_list):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the sum of even numbers in a list.\n\n  Args:\n    number_list (list): A list of integers.\n\n  Returns:\n    int: The sum of even numbers in the list.\n  \"\"\"\n  even_sum = 0\n  for number in number_list:\n    if is_even(number):\n      even_sum += number\n  return even_sum\n\ndef is_even(number):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if a number is even.\n\n  Args:\n    number (int): The number to check.\n\n  Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is even, False otherwise.\n  \"\"\"\n  return number % 2 == 0",
                "Explanation": "The persona-based output is more readable, modular, and well-documented compared to the baseline output. It follows Clean Code Cathy's guidelines by using descriptive names, separating concerns (is_even function), and providing docstrings for each function. The baseline output, while functionally correct, lacks these qualities."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Persona": "Speedy Sam",
                "Problem": "Implement a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of the string.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Implement a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of the string.",
                "Baseline Output": "def reverse_string(string):\n  reversed_string = ''\n  for i in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1):\n    reversed_string += string[i]\n  return reversed_string",
                "Persona-Based Prompt": "Implement a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of the string. Write the code as if you were 'Speedy Sam', focusing on concise and efficient code.",
                "Persona-Based Output": "def reverse_string(s):\n  return s[::-1]",
                "Explanation": "The persona-based output follows Speedy Sam's guidelines by using a concise and efficient one-liner to reverse the string using slicing. The baseline output, while correct, is more verbose and less efficient. This test case demonstrates how the persona-based approach can lead to code that is tailored to specific preferences and requirements."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed persona-based prompting method does not outperform the baselines, consider the following alternative approaches: (1) Analyze the generated code to identify common failure modes and refine the personas or prompts accordingly. (2) Experiment with different LLMs or fine-tuning strategies to improve the model's ability to understand and adhere to personas. (3) Collect a dataset of code samples written by real developers with distinct coding styles and use it to train a style transfer model. Apply the style transfer model to the generated code to enforce persona consistency. (4) Conduct a user study with developers to evaluate the usefulness and practicality of the persona-based approach in real-world scenarios. Gather feedback and insights to inform future iterations of the method."
