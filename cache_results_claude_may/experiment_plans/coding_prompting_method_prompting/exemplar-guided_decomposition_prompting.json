        "Problem": "Existing code generation models often struggle with complex programming tasks that require multiple steps or sub-components. Breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems could help improve the quality and correctness of generated code.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches for code generation typically rely on a single prompt or a few examples to guide the model. However, these methods may not be sufficient for complex, multi-step problems.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by how human programmers approach complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems, we propose a novel prompting method that guides the model to decompose the problem into sub-tasks and generate code for each sub-task using relevant examples.",
        "Proposed Method": "Our method, Exemplar-Guided Decomposition Prompting (EGDP), consists of three main steps: 1) Problem Decomposition: Given a complex programming task, the model is prompted to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems or steps. 2) Exemplar Retrieval: For each sub-problem, the model is prompted to retrieve relevant examples from a pre-defined library of code snippets. 3) Code Generation: The model generates code for each sub-problem, guided by the retrieved examples. The generated sub-problem solutions are then combined to form the final code. EGDP can be applied iteratively, allowing for further decomposition of sub-problems if needed.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate EGDP on a set of complex programming tasks from competitive programming platforms (e.g., CodeChef, Codeforces) and compare its performance with baseline methods such as direct prompting and few-shot learning. Measure the correctness, efficiency, and quality of the generated code using metrics such as pass rate, time complexity, and code readability."

Ensure that the selected tasks require multiple steps or sub-components to solve. Additionally, create a library of code snippets that can be used as examples for various programming concepts and algorithms.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "Design prompts for each step of the EGDP method:\n1. Problem Decomposition Prompt: Prompt the model to break down the complex programming task into smaller sub-problems. For example, 'Please break down the following programming task into smaller sub-problems or steps:'\n2. Exemplar Retrieval Prompt: For each sub-problem, prompt the model to retrieve relevant examples from the code snippet library. For example, 'Please find a relevant code example for the following sub-problem:'\n3.

            "Step 3: Select Models": "Choose state-of-the-art code generation models, such as Codex, GPT-3, or GPT-4, to evaluate the performance of EGDP.",
            "Step 4: Implement Baselines": "Implement baseline methods for comparison, such as direct prompting (providing the entire complex task as a single prompt) and few-shot learning (providing a few examples of similar complex tasks and their solutions).",
            "Step 5: Run Experiments": "Run experiments using the selected models and prompts on the collected dataset of complex programming tasks. For each task, apply the EGDP method and the baseline methods to generate code solutions.",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Results": "Evaluate the generated code solutions using metrics such as pass rate (percentage of test cases passed), time complexity, and code readability. Compare the performance of EGDP with the baseline methods."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed EGDP method does not outperform the baseline methods, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the problem decomposition step to ensure that the sub-problems are properly identified and granular enough to be solved effectively.\n2. Evaluate the quality and relevance of the code snippet library used for exemplar retrieval. Consider expanding the library or using a different source of examples.\n3. Investigate alternative prompting techniques for code generation, such as using more specific instructions or providing additional context.\n4. Conduct an error analysis to identify common patterns in the generated code that lead to incorrect solutions. Use this analysis to inform improvements to the EGDP method.\n5. Consider incorporating additional techniques, such as iterative refinement or post-processing, to improve the quality of the generated code.\nIf the EGDP method still does not yield satisfactory results after these modifications, the project can be turned into an analysis paper that offers insights into the challenges of complex code generation and the limitations of current prompting methods. The analysis can focus on the factors that contribute to the difficulty of the problem, such as the complexity of the required algorithms or the lack of suitable examples in the code snippet library. The paper can also propose potential directions for future research, such as developing more sophisticated problem decomposition techniques or exploring alternative sources of coding examples."
