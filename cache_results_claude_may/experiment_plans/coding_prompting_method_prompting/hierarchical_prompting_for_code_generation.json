    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Generating complex code from high-level specifications remains challenging for large language models. The generated code often lacks proper structure and modularity, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly rely on direct prompting or few-shot prompting, which often fail to capture the hierarchical structure of the code.",
        "Motivation": "Human programmers often break down a complex problem into smaller subproblems and solve them in a hierarchical manner. By mimicking this process, we can guide the language model to generate more structured and modular code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a hierarchical prompting approach for code generation. Given a high-level specification, we first prompt the model to generate an outline of the code structure, including the main components and their relationships. Then, we iteratively prompt the model to fill in the details of each component, following the generated outline. The prompts at each level of the hierarchy provide guidance on the expected structure and functionality of the code. The model is encouraged to generate modular and reusable code snippets at each level, which are then composed to form the final code.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code generation benchmarks such as APPS and HumanEval. We will compare the performance with baselines such as direct prompting and few-shot prompting. The generated code will be evaluated based on correctness, modularity, and readability, using both automatic metrics and human evaluation."

        "Problem Statement": "Generating complex code from high-level specifications remains challenging for large language models. The generated code often lacks proper structure and modularity, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches mainly rely on direct prompting or few-shot prompting, which often fail to capture the hierarchical structure of the code.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We evaluate the proposed method on code generation benchmarks such as APPS and HumanEval. APPS contains around 10,000 coding problems with test cases, while HumanEval consists of 164 hand-written programming problems.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For baselines, we use (1) direct prompting, where the model is prompted with the problem description only, and (2) few-shot prompting, where the model is given a few examples of problem descriptions and their corresponding code solutions. For the proposed hierarchical prompting method, we design prompts at different levels of the code hierarchy. For example, at the top level, the prompt can be: 'Given the problem description, generate an outline of the code structure, including the main components and their relationships.' At the lower levels, the prompts can be: 'Following the code outline, generate the code for component X, considering its expected functionality and interactions with other components.'",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We experiment with state-of-the-art language models for code generation, such as Codex (GPT-3 fine-tuned on code) and GPT-4. We use the OpenAI API to access these models.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each problem in the datasets, we generate code solutions using the baseline methods and the proposed hierarchical prompting method. We run the generated code against the provided test cases to evaluate their correctness and completeness.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We compare the performance of the proposed method with the baselines in terms of code correctness (passing rate of test cases), code quality (modularity, reusability, and readability), and efficiency (runtime and memory usage). We also conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated code to identify common patterns, strengths, and weaknesses of each method."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Direct Prompting)": "Problem: Implement a function to find the nth Fibonacci number.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Direct Prompting)": "def fib(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)",
            "Baseline Prompt Input (Few-Shot Prompting)": "Problem 1: Implement a function to find the factorial of a number.\nSolution 1:\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nProblem 2: Implement a function to find the nth Fibonacci number.",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Few-Shot Prompting)": "def fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hierarchical Prompting, Top-level)": "Problem: Implement a function to find the nth Fibonacci number.\nGenerate an outline of the code structure, including the main components and their relationships.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hierarchical Prompting, Top-level)": "1. Base case: handle the cases where n is 0 or 1\n2. Recursive case: compute the nth Fibonacci number using the recursive formula F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\n3. Main function: implement the fibonacci function that takes n as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number using the base case and recursive case",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hierarchical Prompting, Lower-level 1)": "Following the code outline, generate the code for the base case, considering its expected functionality.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hierarchical Prompting, Lower-level 1)": "if n <= 1:\n    return n",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hierarchical Prompting, Lower-level 2)": "Following the code outline, generate the code for the recursive case, considering its expected functionality.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hierarchical Prompting, Lower-level 2)": "return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Hierarchical Prompting, Lower-level 3)": "Following the code outline, generate the code for the main fibonacci function, considering its expected functionality and interactions with the base case and recursive case.",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Hierarchical Prompting, Lower-level 3)": "def fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)",
            "Explanation": "The direct prompting approach generates a correct solution but lacks structure and modularity. The few-shot prompting approach improves the code quality slightly by providing examples. The hierarchical prompting approach breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and guides the model to generate code for each component, resulting in a more structured and modular solution."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed hierarchical prompting method does not outperform the baselines, we can conduct further analysis to identify the reasons. Some possible directions include: (1) Analyzing the generated code outlines to see if they capture the key components and relationships of the code structure. If not, we can refine the top-level prompts to provide more guidance on the expected outline. (2) Examining the generated code for each component to see if they follow the expected functionality and interact properly with other components. If not, we can refine the lower-level prompts to provide more specific guidance on the code implementation. (3) Investigating the composition process to see if the generated code snippets are properly integrated to form the final code. If not, we can explore alternative composition strategies or introduce additional prompts to guide the integration process. Based on the findings, we can iteratively refine the prompts and the hierarchical prompting approach to improve the code generation performance. If the proposed method still fails to outperform the baselines after multiple iterations, we can consider alternative approaches, such as combining hierarchical prompting with other techniques like reinforcement learning or program synthesis, or exploring different model architectures and training strategies tailored for structured code generation."
