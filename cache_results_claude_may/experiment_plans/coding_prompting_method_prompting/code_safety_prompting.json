    "idea_name": "Code Safety Prompting",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Since code generated by large language models can be directly executed, malicious or buggy generated code can lead to severe security vulnerabilities and unintended system behaviors.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current approaches mainly rely on post-hoc code analysis tools and human inspection to catch unsafe generated code. Some recent work has also explored training LLMs to follow code safety best practices.",
        "Motivation": "We argue that code safety should be proactively prompted for during the generation process itself, rather than leaving it as a post-processing step. We aim to prompt LLMs to carefully consider and explain potential safety risks at each step of code generation.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Code Safety Prompting, where we alternate between code generation and safety reflection prompted steps: 1) Code Generation Prompt to generate a code chunk, 2) Safety Reflection Prompt to analyze the generated code for potential safety risks and explain mitigations, and 3) Safe Code Refinement Prompt to refine the generated code incorporating the suggested mitigations. This cycle repeats until the full code is generated. We will engineer the safety reflection prompt with examples of common safety risks and coding best practices.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our approach on a collection of code generation tasks in multiple languages (e.g. HumanEval, MBPP), where we will inject intentional security vulnerabilities into the instructions. We will use code safety analysis tools and human evaluation to measure the reduction in safety risks compared to baselines without safety prompting. We will also conduct a user study with developers to assess the usefulness of the generated safety reflections and refinements."

        "Title": "Code Safety Prompting: Proactively Generating Safe Code with Large Language Models",
        "Problem Statement": "Since code generated by large language models can be directly executed, malicious or buggy generated code can lead to severe security vulnerabilities and unintended system behaviors.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches mainly rely on post-hoc code analysis tools and human inspection to catch unsafe generated code. Some recent work has also explored training LLMs to follow code safety best practices. However, we argue that code safety should be proactively prompted for during the generation process itself, rather than leaving it as a post-processing step. By prompting LLMs to carefully consider and explain potential safety risks at each step of code generation, we aim to generate safer code from the start.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Code Safety Prompting, where we alternate between code generation and safety reflection prompted steps: 1) Code Generation Prompt to generate a code chunk, 2) Safety Reflection Prompt to analyze the generated code for potential safety risks and explain mitigations, and 3) Safe Code Refinement Prompt to refine the generated code incorporating the suggested mitigations. This cycle repeats until the full code is generated. We will engineer the safety reflection prompt with examples of common safety risks and coding best practices.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate our approach on a collection of code generation tasks in multiple languages, including HumanEval (Python), MBPP (Python), and CodeContests (C++). For each dataset, we will inject intentional security vulnerabilities into a subset of the instructions to test if our method can avoid generating unsafe code.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We will compare our Code Safety Prompting approach to two baselines: 1) Direct Prompting, where we simply prompt the model with the code generation instruction, and 2) Chain-of-Thought Prompting, where we append 'Let's think step by step to write secure code:' to the instruction. For our proposed method, we will construct the following prompts:\n1) Code Generation Prompt: Concatenate the original instruction with 'Write the code to implement this functionality:'\n2) Safety Reflection Prompt: Concatenate the generated code with 'Analyze the above code for potential safety risks. Explain how the risks can be mitigated:'\n3) Safe Code Refinement Prompt: Concatenate the original instruction, generated code, and suggested mitigations with 'Refine the code to incorporate the safety improvements:'",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use OpenAI's text-davinci-003 (GPT-3.5) and gpt-4 models via API access. We will also test open-source models like Anthropic's claude-v1 and Stability AI's stablelm-base-alpha-7b if API access is available.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each task and model combination, we will generate code using the baseline prompts and our Code Safety Prompting approach. We will run each experiment with 3 random seeds and report the average results.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will use both automated code safety analysis tools (e.g., Bandit for Python, Flawfinder for C++) and manual inspection by security experts to measure the number and severity of safety risks in the generated code. We will compare the code safety metrics between the baselines and our approach. We will also assess the code correctness and quality using the original dataset metrics. Finally, we will qualitatively analyze the safety reflections and refinements generated by our prompts."

            "Proposed Prompt Input (Code Safety Prompting; Step 1: Code Generation)": "# Instruction: Write a Python function to execute a shell command given as a string.\n\ndef run_command(cmd):",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Code Safety Prompting; Step 1: Code Generation)": "def run_command(cmd):\n    import subprocess\n    output = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)\n    return output.decode('utf-8')",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Code Safety Prompting; Step 2: Safety Reflection)": "Analyze the above code for potential safety risks. Explain how the risks can be mitigated:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Code Safety Prompting; Step 2: Safety Reflection)": "The given code has the following safety risks:\n1. Arbitrary command execution: The `cmd` argument is passed directly to `subprocess.check_output` with `shell=True`, allowing execution of any shell command. This can be exploited by attackers if they control the `cmd` string.\n2. Lack of input validation: There are no checks on the type or content of the `cmd` argument. Malicious or malformed input could cause unintended behavior or crashes.\n\nTo mitigate these risks:\n1. Avoid using `shell=True` if possible. Pass the command and arguments as a list to `subprocess.check_output` instead.\n2. If `shell=True` is necessary, carefully validate and sanitize the `cmd` argument before execution. Ensure it only contains expected characters and patterns.\n3. Add input validation to check that `cmd` is a string and contains only allowed characters.\n4. Use `subprocess.run` instead of `subprocess.check_output` for better error handling and to avoid blocking on large outputs.\n5. Set a timeout to prevent long-running commands from hanging the process.\n6. Limit the privileges of the Python process to minimize damage from potential command injection.",
            "Proposed Prompt Input (Code Safety Prompting; Step 3: Safe Code Refinement)": "Refine the code to incorporate the safety improvements:",
            "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Code Safety Prompting; Step 3: Safe Code Refinement)": "import re\nimport subprocess\n\ndef run_command(cmd):\n    # Validate input\n    if not isinstance(cmd, str):\n        raise ValueError(\"Command must be a string\")\n    # Sanitize input\n    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9 ]+$', cmd):\n        raise ValueError(\"Command contains invalid characters\")\n    # Use subprocess.run for better error handling\n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(cmd.split(), check=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, timeout=60)\n        return result.stdout.decode('utf-8')\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print(f\"Command execution failed with error: {e.stderr.decode('utf-8')}\")\n        return None\n    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:\n        print(\"Command timed out after 60 seconds\")\n        return None",
            "explanation": "The direct prompting baseline generates unsafe code that is vulnerable to shell injection attacks. The chain-of-thought baseline improves safety somewhat by adding input validation and better error handling, but still allows arbitrary commands. The proposed Code Safety Prompting method first generates similar unsafe code to the direct prompting baseline. However, the safety reflection step identifies the arbitrary command execution and input validation risks, and suggests detailed mitigations. Finally, the safe code refinement step incorporates these improvements to produce much safer code, including input validation, sanitization, using subprocess.run, setting a timeout, and splitting the command string into arguments to avoid shell injection entirely."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed Code Safety Prompting method does not significantly reduce safety risks compared to the baselines, we can conduct additional analysis to understand why. Some ideas:\n1. Examine the quality and specificity of the generated safety reflections. Are the identified risks and mitigations relevant and comprehensive? Fine-tune the safety reflection prompt with more diverse examples if needed.\n2. Evaluate the safe code refinements. Do they accurately address the identified risks? Experiment with different prompt formulations to encourage more effective refinements.\n3. Analyze failure cases. Manually inspect generated code samples that still contain safety risks. Look for patterns in the types of risks that are missed or inadequately mitigated.\n4. Assess the impact of model size and type. Test if more advanced models like GPT-4 or those fine-tuned on code (e.g., Codex) perform better at generating safe code and understanding risks.\n\nIf the results remain unsatisfactory, we can pivot to an analysis of why proactive safety prompting is challenging. Potential experiments:\n1. Evaluate human-written safety reflections and refinements as an upper bound. Does human-level understanding of code risks improve generation safety?\n2. Study the trade-off between code correctness and safety. Does emphasizing safety lead to less functional code?\n3. Explore alternative prompting strategies, such as debate between code generation and critique agents.\n4. Investigate the limitations of LLMs in understanding code semantics and reasoning about risks."
