        "Problem": "Generating code from natural language descriptions is challenging, especially when the descriptions are ambiguous or incomplete. Large language models often struggle to capture the precise intent of the user and generate code that matches the desired functionality.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly rely on direct prompting or few-shot prompting, where the model is provided with a few examples of code snippets and their corresponding descriptions. However, these approaches often fail to capture the nuances and variations in user requirements.",
        "Motivation": "Providing relevant and diverse examples can guide the language model to better understand the user's intent and generate code that matches the desired functionality. By leveraging a large corpus of code examples and their descriptions, we can dynamically select the most relevant examples to guide the code synthesis process.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an exemplar-guided prompting approach for code synthesis. Given a natural language description of the desired functionality, we first retrieve a set of relevant code examples from a large corpus. The retrieval is based on the semantic similarity between the description and the examples' descriptions. Then, we prompt the model with the retrieved examples, along with the original description, to guide the code synthesis process. The prompts encourage the model to learn from the examples and generate code that matches the user's intent. The retrieved examples are dynamically updated based on the generated code and the user's feedback, allowing for iterative refinement of the synthesized code.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code synthesis benchmarks, such as the CoNaLa and CodeSearchNet datasets. We will compare the performance with baselines such as direct prompting and few-shot prompting. The generated code will be evaluated based on correctness, relevance to the user's intent, and diversity. We will also conduct user studies to assess the effectiveness of the exemplar-guided prompting in real-world scenarios, where users provide natural language descriptions of their desired functionality."

        "Problem Statement": "Generating code from natural language descriptions is challenging, especially when the descriptions are ambiguous or incomplete. Large language models often struggle to capture the precise intent of the user and generate code that matches the desired functionality.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will use the CoNaLa and CodeSearchNet datasets for evaluation. These datasets contain natural language descriptions and their corresponding code snippets in various programming languages.",
            "Step 2: Preprocess Data": "Preprocess the datasets by tokenizing the natural language descriptions and code snippets. Remove any irrelevant characters and normalize the code formatting.",
            "Step 3: Implement Retrieval Module": "Develop a retrieval module that takes a natural language description as input and retrieves the most relevant code examples from the dataset. Use semantic similarity measures such as cosine similarity or TF-IDF to compute the relevance scores. Experiment with different similarity thresholds to control the number and diversity of retrieved examples.",
            "Step 4: Construct Prompts": "Design prompts that incorporate the retrieved examples along with the original natural language description. The prompts should encourage the model to learn from the examples and generate code that matches the user's intent. Example prompt:\n\nGenerate code based on the following description and examples:\n\nDescription: [Original natural language description]\n\nExamples:\n[Example 1 description]\n[Example 1 code]\n\n[Example 2 description]\n[Example 2 code]\n\n...\n\nGenerated Code:",
            "Step 5: Fine-tune Language Model": "Fine-tune a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3, CodeBERT) on the constructed prompts. Use a subset of the dataset for fine-tuning and reserve the remaining for evaluation. Experiment with different fine-tuning strategies, such as varying the number of training epochs and the learning rate.",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Generated Code": "Evaluate the generated code snippets using metrics such as exact match accuracy, BLEU score, and CodeBLEU score. Compare the performance of the exemplar-guided prompting approach with baselines such as direct prompting and few-shot prompting.",
            "Step 7: Implement Iterative Refinement": "Develop a mechanism for iterative refinement of the generated code based on user feedback. Allow users to provide feedback on the generated code, such as indicating errors or suggesting improvements. Use this feedback to update the retrieved examples and re-generate the code. Repeat this process until the user is satisfied with the generated code.",
            "Step 8: Conduct User Study": "Conduct a user study to assess the effectiveness of the exemplar-guided prompting approach in real-world scenarios. Recruit participants with varying levels of programming expertise and ask them to provide natural language descriptions of desired functionalities. Generate code using the proposed approach and collect user feedback on the quality and relevance of the generated code."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed exemplar-guided prompting approach does not yield satisfactory results, we can consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the retrieved examples to understand their relevance and diversity. If the examples are not sufficiently relevant or diverse, we can explore alternative retrieval techniques or expand the code corpus to include a wider range of examples.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt designs on the generated code quality. Experiment with variations in the prompt structure, such as the order of examples, the inclusion of additional instructions, or the use of task-specific templates.\n3. Evaluate the performance of different pre-trained language models and their suitability for code synthesis tasks. Compare models like GPT-3, CodeBERT, and BART to identify the most effective model for the given problem.\n4. Conduct an in-depth error analysis to identify common patterns and challenges in the generated code. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the current approach and guide the development of targeted improvements.\n5. Explore alternative code synthesis techniques, such as program synthesis from input-output examples or code generation using abstract syntax trees (ASTs). These techniques can be combined with the exemplar-guided prompting approach to enhance the overall code generation quality.\n6. If the proposed approach does not yield significant improvements over the baselines, we can focus on analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the exemplar-guided prompting method. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the challenges of code synthesis from natural language descriptions and contribute to the broader research community."
