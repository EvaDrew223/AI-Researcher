        "Problem": "Understanding the functionality and reasoning behind generated code is crucial for developers to effectively use and maintain the code. However, current code generation models often produce code without accompanying explanations, making it difficult for developers to comprehend the code's purpose and logic.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing code generation methods typically focus on generating code without providing explanations or documentation. Some approaches generate comments, but they often lack the depth and clarity needed for a comprehensive understanding of the code.",
        "Motivation": "By generating code explanations alongside the code itself, developers can better understand the code's functionality, underlying algorithms, and design decisions. This can facilitate code comprehension, maintenance, and collaboration among development teams.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a Prompt Chaining for Code Explanation (PCCE) method that generates code explanations by chaining multiple prompts. The process involves the following steps: 1) Code Generation Prompt: The model is prompted to generate code based on a given problem description. 2) Code Explanation Prompts: The generated code is then used as input for a series of explanation prompts, each focusing on a specific aspect of the code (e.g., overall functionality, key algorithms, data structures, edge cases). The model generates detailed explanations for each prompt, which are then combined to form a comprehensive code explanation. 3) Iterative Refinement: The generated code and explanations undergo an iterative refinement process, where the model is prompted to improve the clarity, coherence, and completeness of the explanations based on predefined criteria.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate PCCE on a diverse set of programming problems and compare the quality and usefulness of the generated code explanations with baseline methods. Conduct a user study with developers to assess the effectiveness of the explanations in facilitating code comprehension and maintenance. Analyze the generated explanations for clarity, completeness, and alignment with the actual code functionality. Measure the impact of the iterative refinement process on the quality of the explanations."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "Select a diverse set of programming problems from various domains (e.g., algorithms, data structures, web development) to evaluate the PCCE method. The problems should cover different difficulty levels and require explanations for various aspects of the code.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "Implement baseline methods for comparison, such as:\n1. Code generation without explanations\n2. Code generation with simple comment generation\n3. Code generation with a single explanation prompt",
            "Step 3: Prompt Design": "Design the prompts for each step of the PCCE method:\n1. Code Generation Prompt: Create a prompt that encourages the model to generate code based on the problem description (e.g., \"Generate Python code to solve the following problem: [problem description]\")\n2. Code Explanation Prompts: Design a series of prompts that focus on different aspects of the code, such as:\n   - Overall functionality: \"Explain the overall functionality of the generated code.\"\n   - Key algorithms: \"Describe the key algorithms used in the code and their purpose.\"\n   - Data structures: \"Identify the main data structures used in the code and explain their role.\"\n   - Edge cases: \"Discuss how the code handles edge cases and potential issues.\"\n3. Iterative Refinement Prompts: Create prompts that guide the model to refine the explanations based on criteria like clarity, coherence, and completeness (e.g., \"Improve the clarity of the explanation by providing more context and examples.\")",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Choose large language models suitable for code generation and explanation tasks (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Codex).",
            "Step 5: Experiment Execution": "Execute the experiments by applying the PCCE method and baseline methods to the selected programming problems. Generate code and explanations for each problem using the designed prompts.",
            "Step 6: Evaluation Metrics": "Develop evaluation metrics to assess the quality and usefulness of the generated code explanations, such as:\n1. Clarity: Measure the clarity and understandability of the explanations.\n2. Completeness: Evaluate the coverage of different aspects of the code in the explanations.\n3. Correctness: Verify the accuracy of the explanations with respect to the generated code.\n4. Usefulness: Conduct a user study with developers to assess the perceived usefulness of the explanations in facilitating code comprehension and maintenance.",
            "Step 7: Result Analysis": "Analyze the results by comparing the performance of the PCCE method with the baseline methods. Evaluate the quality and usefulness of the generated code explanations using the defined metrics. Identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in the PCCE method.",
            "Step 8: Iterative Improvement": "Based on the analysis, iteratively refine the PCCE method by adjusting the prompts, incorporating feedback from the user study, and exploring additional techniques to enhance the quality and usefulness of the generated code explanations."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Problem Description": "Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.",
                "Baseline Method Input": "Generate Python code to solve the following problem: Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.",
                "Baseline Method Expected Output": "def sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)",
                "PCCE Method Input": "Generate Python code to solve the following problem: Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.",
                "PCCE Method Expected Output": "Code:\ndef sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)\n\nExplanations:\nOverall functionality: The sum_even_numbers function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. It filters out the odd numbers and calculates the sum of the remaining even numbers.\n\nKey algorithms: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the numbers list and select only the even numbers. It checks if each number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (%) and includes it in the sum if the remainder is 0.\n\nData structures: The input is a list of integers, and the function returns an integer value representing the sum of the even numbers.\n\nEdge cases: The function handles an empty list as input, returning 0 since there are no even numbers to sum. It also correctly handles lists containing only odd numbers, returning 0 as well.",
                "Explanation": "The PCCE method generates code along with comprehensive explanations covering different aspects of the code. It explains the overall functionality, key algorithms, data structures, and edge cases, providing a clearer understanding of the code compared to the baseline method, which only generates the code without explanations."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Problem Description": "Implement a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of the string.",
                "Baseline Method Input": "Generate Python code to solve the following problem: Implement a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of the string.",
                "Baseline Method Expected Output": "def reverse_string(string):\n    return string[::-1]",
                "PCCE Method Input": "Generate Python code to solve the following problem: Implement a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of the string.",
                "PCCE Method Expected Output": "Code:\ndef reverse_string(string):\n    return string[::-1]\n\nExplanations:\nOverall functionality: The reverse_string function takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string. It effectively reverses the order of the characters in the string.\n\nKey algorithms: The function uses slicing with a step of -1 to reverse the string. By specifying [::-1], it starts from the end of the string and moves towards the beginning, effectively reversing the order of the characters.\n\nData structures: The input and output are both strings. The function manipulates the string directly without using any additional data structures.\n\nEdge cases: The function handles empty strings correctly, returning an empty string as the reverse. It also correctly reverses strings of length 1, returning the same string.",
                "Explanation": "The PCCE method provides a clear explanation of the reverse_string function, covering its overall functionality, the key algorithm used (slicing with a negative step), the data structures involved (strings), and how it handles edge cases (empty strings and strings of length 1). This comprehensive explanation enhances the understanding of the code compared to the baseline method, which only generates the code itself."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed PCCE method does not significantly improve the quality and usefulness of code explanations compared to the baseline methods, consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the generated explanations to identify specific areas where the PCCE method falls short. This may involve examining the clarity, completeness, and correctness of the explanations for different aspects of the code.\n2. Conduct a detailed error analysis to understand the limitations of the PCCE method. Identify common patterns or challenges in generating comprehensive code explanations.\n3. Explore alternative prompt designs or techniques to address the identified limitations. This may include using more targeted prompts, incorporating domain-specific knowledge, or leveraging additional information sources.\n4. Investigate the impact of different model architectures or pre-training strategies on the quality of code explanations. Experiment with alternative models or fine-tuning approaches to improve the generation of explanations.\n5. Collect a dataset of high-quality code explanations written by experienced developers and use it to fine-tune the language models specifically for the task of generating code explanations.\n6. Conduct a more extensive user study with a larger sample of developers to gather insights into their preferences and requirements for code explanations. Use this feedback to refine the PCCE method and tailor the explanations to the needs of the target audience.\n7. If the PCCE method does not yield satisfactory results after iterative refinements, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the challenges and limitations of generating comprehensive code explanations using large language models. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the current state of code explanation generation and guide future research directions in this area."
