    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Generating correct and efficient code for complex problems often requires multiple intermediate steps, such as problem decomposition, algorithmic planning, implementation, testing, and debugging. Current language models struggle to effectively coordinate and execute these steps.",
        "Existing Methods": "Chain-of-thought prompting has shown promise in enabling language models to perform multi-step reasoning. However, it has mostly been applied to natural language tasks and not much to code generation.",
        "Motivation": "We propose to extend the idea of chain-of-thought prompting to the code generation setting. By breaking down the coding process into a sequence of smaller steps and prompting the model to generate intermediate outputs for each step, we can guide the model to generate better code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Prompt Chaining for Code Generation (PC-Code). Given a coding problem, we break down the solution process into multiple steps: 1) Problem Understanding: Analyze the problem description and identify key components such as input/output formats, constraints, and test cases. 2) Algorithm Design: Come up with a high-level algorithmic approach to solve the problem. 3) Implementation: Convert the algorithm into concrete code. 4) Testing: Generate test cases and evaluate the code. 5) Debugging: If the code fails any test cases, identify the bugs and fix them. We design a prompt template for each step, and chain them together to guide the model to sequentially generate the intermediate outputs, which then serve as context for the subsequent prompts. The key idea is to decompose the complex code generation process into manageable steps and provide structured guidance to the model via prompt chaining.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate PC-Code on various competitive programming and coding interview problem benchmarks. We will compare our approach with standard few-shot prompting, as well as chain-of-thought prompting baselines. The key evaluation metrics will be the percentage of problems solved, the quality and efficiency of the generated code, as well as the interpretability of the intermediate outputs. We will also conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in the prompt chain."

        "Problem Statement": "Generating correct and efficient code for complex problems often requires multiple intermediate steps, such as problem decomposition, algorithmic planning, implementation, testing, and debugging. Current language models struggle to effectively coordinate and execute these steps, leading to suboptimal code generation.",
        "Motivation": "Chain-of-thought prompting has shown promise in enabling language models to perform multi-step reasoning for natural language tasks. However, it has not been extensively applied to code generation. We propose to extend the idea of chain-of-thought prompting to guide language models through the complex process of code generation by breaking it down into a sequence of smaller, more manageable steps. By prompting the model to generate intermediate outputs for each step, we aim to improve the quality and correctness of the generated code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Prompt Chaining for Code Generation (PC-Code), a novel prompting method that decomposes the code generation process into multiple steps: 1) Problem Understanding: Analyze the problem description and identify key components such as input/output formats, constraints, and test cases. 2) Algorithm Design: Come up with a high-level algorithmic approach to solve the problem. 3) Implementation: Convert the algorithm into concrete code. 4) Testing: Generate test cases and evaluate the code. 5) Debugging: If the code fails any test cases, identify the bugs and fix them.

            "Step 3: Baseline Methods": "Compare PC-Code with the following baselines:\n1) Standard Few-Shot Prompting: Provide the model with a few examples of coding problems and their solutions, and then prompt it to generate code for a new problem.\n2) Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Append a generic prompt like 'Let's solve this step-by-step:' to the problem description and generate the code directly.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) as the base language models for the experiments.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "Evaluate the generated code using the following metrics:\n1) Correctness: The percentage of problems for which the generated code passes all test cases.\n2) Efficiency: The time and space complexity of the generated code.\n3) Code Quality: Assess the readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices of the generated code.",
            "Step 6: Ablation Studies": "Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each step in the PC-Code method. Evaluate the performance when removing or modifying each step in the prompt chain.",

Experiment with different prompt variations and orderings to determine if certain steps are more critical than others or if a different sequence of steps leads to better performance.\n3. Investigate the impact of problem complexity and domain on the effectiveness of PC-Code. Identify specific types of problems or algorithmic concepts that are particularly challenging for the method and analyze the reasons behind the difficulties.\n4. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated code to identify common patterns, strengths, and weaknesses of PC-Code compared to the baselines. This can provide insights into the model's reasoning process and help us develop targeted improvements.\n5. Explore the integration of additional steps or techniques into the PC-Code method, such as incorporating test-driven development principles or leveraging external knowledge sources to enhance the model's understanding of the problem domain.\nIf the proposed method still does not yield satisfactory results after these additional experiments and analyses, we can focus on turning the project into an in-depth analysis of the challenges and limitations of prompt chaining for code generation. This can involve a comprehensive study of the failure modes, the impact of problem complexity, and the potential barriers to effective multi-step reasoning in code generation tasks. The insights gained from this analysis can inform future research directions and the development of more advanced prompting techniques for code generation."
