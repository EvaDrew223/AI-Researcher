        "Problem": "Generating code for complex problems often involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and then composing the solutions to obtain the final code. Current approaches often struggle to effectively decompose the problem and generate modular and reusable code components.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing code generation methods typically generate code in a single pass, without explicitly breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems or generating reusable code components.",
        "Motivation": "By explicitly guiding the model to decompose the problem into smaller subproblems and generate code for each subproblem separately, we can encourage the model to produce more modular and reusable code components. The decomposition process helps the model focus on solving each subproblem independently, while the composition step ensures that the generated code components work together to solve the overall problem.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a code generation approach that incorporates problem decomposition and code composition. The method involves the following steps: 1) Prompt the model to decompose the problem into smaller subproblems based on the problem description and requirements. 2) Generate code for each subproblem separately, focusing on creating modular and reusable code components. 3) Compose the generated code components to solve the overall problem, ensuring proper integration and compatibility. 4) Refine the composed code by identifying and resolving any integration issues or inconsistencies.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on code generation tasks that involve solving complex problems requiring multiple code components. Compare the performance with baselines that generate code in a single pass. Assess the modularity, reusability, and composability of the generated code components. Measure the overall correctness and efficiency of the composed code."

Current approaches often struggle to effectively decompose the problem and generate modular and reusable code components.",
        "Motivation": "Existing code generation methods typically generate code in a single pass, without explicitly breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems or generating reusable code components. This approach often leads to monolithic and hard-to-maintain code. By explicitly guiding the model to decompose the problem into smaller subproblems and generate code for each subproblem separately, we can encourage the model to produce more modular and reusable code components. The decomposition process helps the model focus on solving each subproblem independently, while the composition step ensures that the generated code components work together to solve the overall problem.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a code generation approach called Decompose-Solve-Compose (DSC) that incorporates problem decomposition and code composition. The method involves the following steps:\n1. Decompose: Prompt the model to decompose the problem into smaller subproblems based on the problem description and requirements.\n2. Solve: Generate code for each subproblem separately, focusing on creating modular and reusable code components.\n3. Compose: Compose the generated code components to solve the overall problem, ensuring proper integration and compatibility.\n4. Refine: Refine the composed code by identifying and resolving any integration issues or inconsistencies.",

            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will use two datasets for evaluation: (1) APPS dataset containing competitive programming problems with test cases, and (2) CodeContests dataset containing programming contest problems from Codeforces. These datasets cover a wide range of programming problems and difficulty levels.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For the baseline, we will use direct prompting where the model is given the problem description and asked to generate the code directly. For the proposed DSC method, we will construct prompts for each step:\n1. Decompose: \"Given the following coding problem, break it down into smaller subproblems. Provide a brief description of each subproblem and how they relate to the overall problem.\"\n2. Solve: \"Generate code to solve the subproblem [subproblem description]. Focus on creating modular and reusable code components.\"\n3. Compose: \"Given the code components generated for each subproblem, compose them to solve the overall problem. Ensure proper integration and compatibility between the components.\"\n4. Refine: \"Review the composed code and identify any integration issues or inconsistencies. Refine the code to resolve these issues and improve its overall quality.\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use GPT-4 and Codex (code-davinci-002) for the experiments. These models have shown strong performance on code generation tasks.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each problem in the datasets, we will generate code using both the baseline and the proposed DSC method. We will evaluate the generated code by running it against the provided test cases and measuring the pass rate.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will compare the performance of the baseline and the DSC method in terms of test case pass rate. Additionally, we will qualitatively analyze the generated code to assess its modularity, reusability, and overall quality. We will also measure the code length and number of functions/classes to quantify the modularity of the generated code."

If the decomposition step is not effective, it can impact the overall performance.\n2. Evaluate the modularity and reusability of the generated code components. If the generated code is not modular enough, it may not lead to the desired benefits.\n3. Assess the effectiveness of the composition step in integrating the code components. If there are integration issues or incompatibilities, it can affect the correctness and efficiency of the final code.\n4. Experiment with different prompts and instructions for each step of the DSC method to see if alternative formulations can lead to better results.\nBased on the findings from the additional analysis, we can propose modifications to the DSC method or explore alternative approaches to address the identified issues. If the results provide valuable insights into the challenges of modular code generation, we can focus on presenting those findings and turn the project into an analysis paper."
