    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate code that is syntactically correct but semantically flawed or logically inconsistent. They also struggle to generate code for complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and abstraction.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing benchmarks like HumanEval and APPS test LLMs' code generation capabilities from natural language descriptions. Baseline methods include direct prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting.",
        "Motivation": "The Socratic method is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. We posit that prompting LLMs to engage in a Socratic dialogue while generating code can help them reason about the problem more abstractly, break it down into smaller subproblems, and generate more logically consistent code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Socratic Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to engage in a multi-turn dialogue to generate code. The dialogue starts with the problem description. At each turn, the LLM is prompted to ask a clarifying question about the problem or the approach to solve it. The answer to this question (also generated by the LLM) is added to the context. The LLM then attempts to generate code based on the accumulated context. If the code is complete and correct, the dialogue ends. If not, the LLM is prompted to identify issues or missing pieces in the current code, and the process repeats. The key is to prompt the LLM to ask meaningful questions that lead to a robust problem-solving approach.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Socratic Prompting on the HumanEval and APPS benchmarks, comparing it with baselines like direct prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting. We will measure pass@k rates and code quality metrics. We will also perform a qualitative analysis of the generated dialogues to understand how Socratic Prompting aids the reasoning process."

        "Title": "Socratic Prompting: Engaging Large Language Models in Socratic Dialogue for Improved Code Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate code that is syntactically correct but semantically flawed or logically inconsistent. They also struggle to generate code for complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and abstraction.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods like direct prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting have shown promising results on code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and APPS. However, these methods do not fully leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Socratic method, a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and draw out ideas, has the potential to guide LLMs to reason about the problem more abstractly, break it down into smaller subproblems, and generate more logically consistent code. By engaging LLMs in a Socratic dialogue during the code generation process, we aim to improve their performance on complex coding tasks.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Socratic Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to engage in a multi-turn dialogue to generate code. The dialogue starts with the problem description.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate Socratic Prompting on the HumanEval and APPS datasets. HumanEval contains 164 hand-written programming problems with test cases. APPS contains 10,000 problems with test cases mined from online programming platforms.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We will compare Socratic Prompting with the following baselines:\n1. Direct prompting: Provide only the problem description in the prompt.\n2. Few-shot prompting: Include a few examples of problems and their solutions in the prompt.\n3. Chain-of-thought prompting: Prompt the model to generate a chain of thought before generating the code.\nFor Socratic Prompting, we will design a prompt template that encourages the model to ask clarifying questions, generate answers, and iteratively refine the code. The prompt will include instructions like:\n- Ask a question to clarify the problem or the approach to solve it.\n- Based on the question and answer, attempt to generate the code.\n- If the code is incomplete or incorrect, identify the issues or missing pieces.\n- Repeat the process until the code is complete and correct.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use GPT-4 and Codex (code-davinci-002) for our experiments, as they are the state-of-the-art models for natural language and code generation tasks.",
            "Step 4: Run Experiments": "For each problem in the datasets, we will generate code using the baseline methods and Socratic Prompting. We will run the generated code against the test cases to evaluate its correctness.",
            "Step 5: Evaluate Results": "We will measure the pass@k rates (the percentage of problems for which the model generates a correct solution within k attempts) for each method. We will compare the performance of Socratic Prompting with the baselines to assess its effectiveness. We will also perform a qualitative analysis of the generated dialogues to understand how Socratic Prompting aids the reasoning process."
