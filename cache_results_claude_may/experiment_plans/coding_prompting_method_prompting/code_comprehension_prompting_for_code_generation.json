    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Generating correct and efficient code requires a deep understanding of the problem domain and the underlying algorithmic concepts. Current language models often struggle to capture this understanding and instead generate superficial or incorrect code.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for code generation typically rely on providing the model with problem descriptions, input/output examples, and sometimes reference code. However, they do not explicitly test the model's comprehension of the problem and the key algorithmic concepts.",
        "Motivation": "We propose to enhance the prompting process for code generation by first probing the model's understanding of the problem and the relevant algorithmic concepts. By asking the model to explain the problem, describe the key ideas for solving it, and even teach the concepts to a student, we can gauge its level of comprehension. The model's responses can then be used to provide additional context and guidance when prompting it to generate code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce Code Comprehension Prompting (CCP) for code generation. Given a coding problem, we first prompt the model with a series of questions to test its understanding: 1) Problem Explanation: Explain the problem in your own words. 2) Algorithmic Ideas: Describe the key algorithmic ideas needed to solve this problem. 3) Concept Teaching: Imagine you are teaching these concepts to a computer science student. How would you explain them? We then use the model's responses to these questions as additional context when prompting it to generate code. Specifically, we include the problem explanation, algorithmic ideas, and concept teaching in the prompt template, along with the original problem description and input/output examples. The key idea is to first elicit the model's understanding of the problem and concepts, and then use that to guide the code generation process.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate CCP on coding problems from various domains, such as algorithms, data structures, math, and programming language-specific tasks. We will compare our approach with standard prompting methods that do not include the comprehension steps. The key evaluation metrics will be the correctness and efficiency of the generated code, as well as the quality of the model's explanations and teachings. We will also conduct human evaluations to assess the usefulness of the model's responses for aiding comprehension and coding."

Specifically, we will use problems from LeetCode, Project Euler, Rosalind, and Codeforces. For each problem, we will collect the problem description, input/output examples, and reference solutions.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each problem, we will construct the following prompts:\n1. Baseline Prompt: This includes the problem description and input/output examples.\n2. CCP Prompt: This includes the problem description, input/output examples, and the model's responses to the comprehension questions (problem explanation, algorithmic ideas, and concept teaching).\nWe will use few-shot prompting, where we include 2-3 examples of the comprehension questions and their responses in the prompt template.",

Readability: We will ask human evaluators to rate the readability and clarity of the generated code on a scale of 1-5.\nWe will compare the performance of CCP with the baseline prompts and conduct statistical significance tests to determine if the improvements are significant.",
            "Step 6: Analyze Model Responses": "We will qualitatively analyze the model's responses to the comprehension questions to gain insights into its understanding of the problems and concepts. We will look for patterns in the responses and identify common strengths and weaknesses of the models in terms of problem comprehension."

                "Baseline Output": "def twoSum(nums, target):\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:\n                return [i, j]\n    return []",
                "CCP Prompt": "Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.\nProblem Explanation: The problem is asking us to find two numbers in the given array that add up to the target value and return their indices. We need to find a pair of numbers that satisfy this condition.\nAlgorithmic Ideas: To solve this problem, we can use the following ideas:\n1. Brute Force: We can use nested loops to check all possible pairs of numbers and see if they add up to the target. This will have a time complexity of O(n^2).\n2. Hash Table: We can use a hash table to store the numbers we have seen so far. For each number, we check if there is a complement (target - current number) in the hash table. If there is, we have found the required pair. This will have a time complexity of O(n).\nConcept Teaching: To explain the hash table approach to a student, we can use the following analogy:\nImagine you have a box full of numbers and a target sum. You want to find two numbers that add up to the target. One way to do this is to take each number and check if the box contains the complement (target - number). If it does, you have found the pair. The hash table is like this box, allowing you to quickly check if a number exists.\nWrite a function to solve this problem in Python using the hash table approach.",
                "CCP Output": "def twoSum(nums, target):\n    num_map = {}  # Hash table to store numbers and their indices\n    \n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_map:\n            return [num_map[complement], i]  # Found the pair\n        num_map[num] = i  # Add the current number to the hash table\n    \n    return []  # No pair found",
                "Explanation": "The baseline prompt simply provides the problem description and examples, without testing the model's comprehension. As a result, the model generates a brute force solution that is correct but inefficient (O(n^2) time complexity). In contrast, the CCP prompt first asks the model to explain the problem, describe the algorithmic ideas (brute force and hash table), and teach the concepts to a student. The model's responses demonstrate a deeper understanding of the problem and the optimal solution using a hash table. When prompted to generate code, the model produces a more efficient solution with O(n) time complexity. This example illustrates how CCP can guide the model towards better code generation by first eliciting its understanding of the problem and concepts."

We need to identify the substring with the maximum length that satisfies this condition.\nAlgorithmic Ideas: To solve this problem, we can use the following ideas:\n1. Brute Force: We can generate all possible substrings and check if they contain repeating characters. We keep track of the longest substring without repeats. This will have a time complexity of O(n^3).\n2. Sliding Window: We can use a sliding window approach to optimize the solution. We use two pointers to define the window and expand it as long as there are no repeating characters. If we encounter a repeating character, we shrink the window from the left side. This will have a time complexity of O(n).\nConcept Teaching: To explain the sliding window approach to a student, we can use the following analogy:\nImagine you have a string of characters written on a strip of paper. You want to find the longest substring without repeats. You can use two markers (pointers) to define a window on the strip. Move the right marker to expand the window and the left marker to shrink it. If you encounter a repeating character, move the left marker to the right of the previous occurrence of that character. Keep track of the longest window you have seen so far.\nWrite a function to solve this problem in Python using the sliding window approach.",

                "Explanation": "The baseline prompt only provides the problem description and examples, without probing the model's understanding. The model generates a brute force solution that checks all possible substrings, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^3). On the other hand, the CCP prompt asks the model to explain the problem, describe the algorithmic ideas (brute force and sliding window), and teach the concepts to a student. The model's responses show a clear understanding of the optimal sliding window approach. When asked to generate code, the model produces an efficient solution with O(n) time complexity. This example demonstrates how CCP can guide the model to generate better code by first assessing its comprehension of the problem and the underlying algorithmic concepts."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCP method does not lead to significant improvements in code generation performance, we can consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the model's responses to the comprehension questions to identify potential weaknesses or gaps in understanding. This can help us refine the questions or provide additional guidance to the model.\n2. Experiment with different prompt templates and formats to see if they have an impact on the model's comprehension and code generation. We can try variations such as providing more examples, using different wording for the questions, or including additional context.\n3. Investigate the impact of model size and architecture on code comprehension and generation. We can compare the performance of different models (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM-Coder, GPT-4) to see if certain models are better suited for this task.\n4. Collect human-generated explanations and concept teachings for a subset of the problems and compare them with the model's responses. This can help us identify areas where the model's understanding differs from human understanding and potentially guide further improvements.\n5. If the CCP method does not yield significant improvements, we can focus on analyzing the model's responses and the generated code to gain insights into the challenges and limitations of code generation. This can lead to an informative analysis paper that sheds light on the current state of code generation and potential directions for future research."
