    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models can generate code snippets, but the generated code may not always follow best practices, coding conventions, or be optimized for performance.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for code generation primarily focus on generating functional code without considering code quality aspects such as readability, maintainability, and performance.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to critique its own generated code, we can encourage it to identify areas for improvement and generate higher-quality code. The model can learn to spot common pitfalls, suggest optimizations, and adhere to coding best practices.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Code Critique Prompting (CCP) for code generation. CCP prompts the model to generate code and then critique its own generated code. The critique focuses on aspects such as code readability, maintainability, performance, and adherence to coding conventions. The model is prompted to identify potential issues, suggest improvements, and provide explanations for its recommendations. The critique is presented as comments within the generated code. The model then incorporates the critique feedback to iteratively refine the code. This process continues until the model determines that the code meets the desired quality standards.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CCP on code generation benchmarks and assess the quality of the generated code using metrics such as code complexity, readability scores, and performance benchmarks. Conduct a user study with experienced developers to rate the quality and usefulness of the generated critiques. Compare CCP with baseline methods that generate code without self-critique."

        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate code snippets, but the generated code may not always follow best practices, coding conventions, or be optimized for performance.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for code generation primarily focus on generating functional code without considering code quality aspects such as readability, maintainability, and performance.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We evaluate CCP on code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval, APPS, and CodeContests. These datasets provide coding problems along with test cases to assess the functionality and correctness of the generated code.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For the baseline, we use direct prompting where the model is given a coding problem and prompted to generate a solution. For CCP, we construct a two-stage prompting process:\n1. Code Generation: The model is prompted with the coding problem and asked to generate a solution.\n2. Code Critique: The generated code is passed back to the model along with instructions to critique the code. The critique prompt includes specific aspects to focus on, such as readability, maintainability, performance, and adherence to coding conventions. The model is encouraged to provide explanations for its recommendations.\nThe model iterates between these two stages until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or the model indicating that the code meets the desired quality standards).",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We experiment with state-of-the-art language models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), and Codex.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each coding problem in the datasets, we generate code using both the baseline and CCP methods. We assess the generated code using the following metrics:\n1. Functional Correctness: We run the test cases provided in the datasets to evaluate the functional correctness of the generated code.\n2. Code Quality Metrics: We use static code analysis tools to measure code quality metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, and adherence to coding conventions.\n3. Human Evaluation: We conduct a user study with experienced developers to rate the quality and readability of the generated code.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We compare the performance of CCP against the baseline method across the different metrics. We hypothesize that CCP will generate code with improved readability, maintainability, and performance while maintaining functional correctness. We also analyze the generated critiques to gain insights into the model's ability to identify and suggest improvements."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CCP method does not significantly improve code quality compared to the baseline, we can conduct further analysis:\n1. Analyze the generated critiques to assess their relevance and usefulness. Identify areas where the model struggles to provide meaningful feedback.\n2. Evaluate the model's ability to incorporate the critique feedback into the refined code. Investigate cases where the model fails to address the identified issues.\n3. Experiment with different prompting strategies for the critique phase, such as providing more specific guidelines or examples of high-quality code.\n4. Explore alternative evaluation metrics that better capture code quality improvements, such as measuring the reduction in code smells or the adherence to specific coding standards.\nBased on these analyses, we can refine the CCP approach or propose new methods that address the identified limitations. If the results still do not meet the desired improvements, we can pivot the project into an analysis paper that provides insights into the challenges of improving code quality through language model prompting and offers recommendations for future research directions."
