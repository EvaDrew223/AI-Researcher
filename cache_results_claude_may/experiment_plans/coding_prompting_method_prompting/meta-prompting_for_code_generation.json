        "Problem": "Designing effective prompts for code generation can be challenging and often requires domain expertise and trial-and-error. LLMs should be able to assist in the prompt engineering process itself.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing work on prompt engineering for code generation mainly relies on manual design and tuning of prompts. Some methods use automated search or optimization techniques to find good prompts.",
        "Motivation": "Prompt engineering is a critical but time-consuming aspect of using LLMs for code generation. However, LLMs have been shown to have strong abilities in natural language understanding and generation. We propose to leverage these abilities to assist in the prompt engineering process itself.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Meta-Prompting, where we prompt the LLM to generate effective prompts for code generation tasks. Specifically, given a coding problem, we first prompt the LLM to generate multiple candidate prompts that could be used to solve this problem. We then prompt the LLM to analyze each candidate prompt and score them based on criteria like clarity, specificity, and expected effectiveness. We select the highest-scored prompt and use it to actually generate the code. The key is to prompt the LLM to generate diverse and high-quality prompts and to critically evaluate them.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate Meta-Prompting on a subset of problems from the HumanEval and APPS benchmarks. For each problem, we will use Meta-Prompting to generate the final prompt used for code generation. We will compare this with manually engineered prompts and prompts obtained through automated search methods. We will measure pass@k rates and prompt quality metrics like coherence and specificity. We will also perform a qualitative analysis of the generated prompts and their impact on the final generated code."

        "Title": "Meta-Prompting: Leveraging Language Models for Prompt Engineering in Code Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Designing effective prompts for code generation can be challenging and often requires domain expertise and trial-and-error. Large Language Models (LLMs) should be able to assist in the prompt engineering process itself to improve the quality and efficiency of prompt design for code generation tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing work on prompt engineering for code generation mainly relies on manual design and tuning of prompts, which can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. Some methods use automated search or optimization techniques to find good prompts, but these approaches can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to new tasks. LLMs have been shown to have strong abilities in natural language understanding and generation, so we propose to leverage these abilities to assist in the prompt engineering process itself. By prompting the LLM to generate and evaluate prompts, we aim to improve the quality and efficiency of prompt design for code generation tasks.",

We select the highest-scored prompt and use it to actually generate the code. The key is to prompt the LLM to generate diverse and high-quality prompts and to critically evaluate them.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will evaluate Meta-Prompting on a subset of problems from the HumanEval and APPS benchmarks for code generation. These benchmarks cover a diverse set of coding problems and are commonly used to evaluate code generation models.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each coding problem, we will construct the following prompts:\n1. Baseline Prompt: A simple prompt that directly asks the model to generate code to solve the problem, without any additional instructions or examples.\n2. Meta-Prompting Step 1: A prompt that asks the model to generate 3-5 candidate prompts for solving the coding problem. The prompt should encourage the model to generate diverse and high-quality prompts.\nExample: \"Generate 3-5 different prompts that could be used to effectively solve the following coding problem: [problem description]. Each prompt should be clear, specific, and provide helpful instructions or examples to guide the code generation.\"\n3. Meta-Prompting Step 2: A prompt that asks the model to analyze and score each of the candidate prompts generated in Step 1. The model should consider factors like clarity, specificity, and expected effectiveness.\nExample: \"Analyze each of the following prompts for solving the coding problem: [list of candidate prompts]. For each prompt, provide a score from 1-5 (with 5 being the best) based on its clarity, specificity, and expected effectiveness in guiding the code generation. Explain your reasoning for each score.\"\n4. Meta-Prompting Step 3: Select the highest-scored prompt from Step 2 and use it to actually generate the code to solve the original problem.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use the OpenAI Codex model (code-davinci-002) for all experiments, as it is a state-of-the-art model for code generation.",
            "Step 4: Run Experiments": "For each coding problem in the selected HumanEval and APPS subsets:\n1. Generate code using the Baseline Prompt.\n2. Run Meta-Prompting Steps 1-3 to generate code using the highest-scored generated prompt.\n3. Evaluate the generated code from both the Baseline Prompt and Meta-Prompting using the HumanEval and APPS evaluation scripts, which check for functional correctness.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "1. Compare the pass@k rates (i.e., the percentage of problems for which the generated code passes all test cases) between the Baseline Prompt and Meta-Prompting methods. Higher pass@k rates indicate better code generation performance.\n2. Analyze the quality of the generated prompts from Meta-Prompting Steps 1 and 2. Manually review a sample of the prompts and their scores to assess their clarity, specificity, and expected effectiveness. Look for patterns or characteristics of high-scoring vs. low-scoring prompts.\n3. Perform a qualitative analysis of the generated code from both methods. For a sample of problems, compare the code generated by the Baseline Prompt and Meta-Prompting to identify any differences in code quality, readability, or approach.\n4. Measure the time and computational resources required for Meta-Prompting compared to the Baseline Prompt to assess the efficiency of the method."
        },
        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Baseline Prompt Input": "# Write a function to reverse a string.\n\ndef soln(string):",
            "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "def soln(string):\n    return string[::-1]",
            "Meta-Prompting Step 1 Input": "Generate 3-5 different prompts that could be used to effectively solve the following coding problem: Write a function to reverse a string. Each prompt should be clear, specific, and provide helpful instructions or examples to guide the code generation.",
            "Meta-Prompting Step 1 Expected Output": "1. # Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. For example, if the input is \"hello\", the output should be \"olleh\".\n\ndef soln(string):\n\n2. # Implement a string reversal function in Python. The function should take a string parameter and return the string with its characters in reverse order. Do not use the built-in reverse() function. Instead, use string slicing or a loop.\n\ndef soln(string):\n\n3. # Create a function called soln that accepts a string argument and reverses the order of the characters in the string. The reversed string should be returned by the function. Assume the input string only contains ASCII characters and is not empty.\n\ndef soln(string):\n\n4. # Write a Python function to reverse the order of characters in a given string. The function should have the following signature: def soln(string). It should return the reversed string. Handle the case where the input string is empty by returning an empty string.\n\ndef soln(string):",
            "Meta-Prompting Step 2 Input": "Analyze each of the following prompts for solving the coding problem: [list of candidate prompts from Step 1]. For each prompt, provide a score from 1-5 (with 5 being the best) based on its clarity, specificity, and expected effectiveness in guiding the code generation. Explain your reasoning for each score.",
            "Meta-Prompting Step 2 Expected Output": "Prompt 1: Score - 4\nThis prompt is clear and provides a specific example of the expected input and output. It also mentions the language (Python) and the function signature. However, it doesn't give any hints or constraints about the implementation, which could lead to some variability in the generated code.\n\nPrompt 2: Score - 5\nThis prompt is very specific about the requirements, mentioning not to use the built-in reverse() function and suggesting using string slicing or a loop instead. It also specifies the language and function signature. The added constraints and hints make this prompt highly effective for guiding the code generation.\n\nPrompt 3: Score - 3\nWhile this prompt does specify the function name, argument, and return value, it lacks some clarity and specificity. The assumption about ASCII characters is helpful but could be stated more explicitly. It also doesn't provide any examples or hints about the implementation.\n\nPrompt 4: Score - 4\nThis prompt is generally clear and specific, mentioning the language, function signature, and handling of empty input strings. It could be improved by providing an example or hint about the expected implementation, but overall it should be effective for guiding the code generation.",
            "Meta-Prompting Step 3 Input": "# Implement a string reversal function in Python. The function should take a string parameter and return the string with its characters in reverse order. Do not use the built-in reverse() function. Instead, use string slicing or a loop.\n\ndef soln(string):",
            "Meta-Prompting Step 3 Expected Output": "def soln(string):\n    return string[::-1]",
            "Explanation": "The Meta-Prompting approach generates a high-quality prompt that provides clear instructions and constraints, leading to a concise and correct solution using string slicing. In contrast, the Baseline Prompt is more open-ended and may result in more variability or potential errors in the generated code."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the Meta-Prompting method does not outperform the Baseline Prompt in terms of pass@k rates or code quality, we can conduct additional analyses to understand why:\n\n1. Analyze the diversity and quality of the generated prompts from Meta-Prompting Step 1. If the prompts are too similar or lack sufficient variation, modify the Step 1 prompt to encourage more diversity and creativity in the generated prompts.\n\n2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the prompt scoring in Meta-Prompting Step 2. If the highest-scored prompts do not consistently lead to better code generation, refine the scoring criteria or explore alternative methods for selecting the best prompt (e.g., ensemble voting, manual selection).\n\n3. Investigate the impact of different prompt characteristics on code generation performance. Conduct ablation studies by systematically varying aspects of the prompts (e.g., level of detail, inclusion of examples, constraint specificity) to identify the most important factors for effective prompts.\n\n4. Explore alternative prompt generation strategies, such as iterative refinement or collaborative prompt generation between the model and human annotators.\n\nIf Meta-Prompting still does not yield significant improvements after these additional analyses and modifications, the project can pivot to a more in-depth study of prompt engineering challenges and best practices for code generation. This could involve surveying existing literature, conducting interviews with experienced practitioners, or performing a large-scale analysis of prompts and their impact on code generation performance across multiple datasets and models. The insights gained from this study could inform the development of new prompt engineering techniques or guidelines for effective prompt design in code generation tasks."
