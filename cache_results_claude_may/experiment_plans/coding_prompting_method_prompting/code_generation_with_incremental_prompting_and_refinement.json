        "Problem": "Generating code from a single prompt often results in code that is incomplete, inconsistent, or fails to capture the full requirements of the problem. Current approaches lack a systematic way to incrementally improve the generated code based on user feedback and refinement.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing code generation methods typically generate code based on a single prompt and do not incorporate user feedback or iterative refinement into the generation process.",
        "Motivation": "By allowing the user to provide incremental prompts and feedback, we can guide the model to generate code that better aligns with the user's requirements and expectations. The incremental prompting process enables the user to specify additional constraints, clarify ambiguities, and provide examples to steer the code generation in the right direction. The refinement step allows the model to incorporate user feedback and make necessary adjustments to improve the quality of the generated code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose an incremental prompting and refinement approach for code generation. The method involves the following steps: 1) Prompt the model with an initial problem description and generate a draft version of the code. 2) Present the generated code to the user and allow them to provide additional prompts, constraints, or examples to guide the refinement process. 3) Incorporate the user's feedback and generate an updated version of the code. 4) Repeat steps 2-3 until the user is satisfied with the generated code or a maximum number of iterations is reached. 5) Perform a final refinement step to ensure the consistency and correctness of the generated code.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the proposed method on code generation tasks that require multiple iterations of user feedback and refinement. Compare the performance with baselines that generate code based on a single prompt. Assess the quality of the generated code in terms of correctness, completeness, and alignment with user requirements. Measure the number of iterations required to achieve a satisfactory solution and gather user feedback on the effectiveness of the incremental prompting and refinement process."

        "Title": "Iterative Refinement with User Feedback for Code Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Generating code from a single prompt often results in code that is incomplete, inconsistent, or fails to capture the full requirements of the problem.

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will use the APPS dataset for code generation tasks. The dataset contains a diverse set of programming problems with problem descriptions, test cases, and reference solutions in Python. We will use a subset of 100 problems from the dataset for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For each problem, we will construct an initial prompt that includes the problem description and any additional constraints or requirements specified in the dataset. The prompt will be formatted as follows: 'Problem: [problem description]\nConstraints: [additional constraints or requirements]\nGenerate a Python function to solve the above problem.'",
            "Step 3: Generate Initial Code": "We will use the GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) model to generate the initial code based on the constructed prompts. The generated code will be saved for each problem.",
            "Step 4: Simulate User Feedback": "To simulate user feedback, we will compare the generated code with the reference solution and identify areas for improvement. We will manually construct feedback prompts that address specific issues or provide additional examples to guide the refinement process. The feedback prompts will be formatted as follows: 'Generated Code: [previously generated code]\nFeedback: [user feedback or additional examples]\nRefine the generated code based on the provided feedback.'",
            "Step 5: Iterative Refinement": "We will use the GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) model to generate refined versions of the code based on the feedback prompts. The refinement process will be repeated for a maximum of 3 iterations or until the generated code matches the reference solution.",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Performance": "We will evaluate the performance of the iterative refinement approach using the following metrics: 1) Exact match accuracy: The percentage of problems for which the generated code exactly matches the reference solution. 2) Edit distance: The average edit distance between the generated code and the reference solution. 3) Execution accuracy: The percentage of test cases passed by the generated code.",
            "Step 7: Compare with Baselines": "We will compare the performance of the iterative refinement approach with the following baselines: 1) Single-prompt generation: Generating code based on a single prompt without any refinement. 2) Random refinement: Randomly selecting a subset of the generated code and refining it without considering user feedback.",
            "Step 8: Analyze Results": "We will analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of the iterative refinement approach in improving the quality of the generated code. We will also examine the impact of the number of refinement iterations on the performance metrics."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Test Case 1": {
                "Problem": "Write a function to find the maximum element in a list.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Problem: Write a function to find the maximum element in a list.\nGenerate a Python function to solve the above problem.",
                "Baseline Output": "def find_max(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return None\n    max_val = lst[0]\n    for val in lst:\n        if val > max_val:\n            max_val = val\n    return max_val",
                "Feedback Prompt": "Generated Code: [baseline output]\nFeedback: The function should return the maximum element, not the first element of the list. Please fix this issue.",
                "Refined Output": "def find_max(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return None\n    max_val = lst[0]\n    for val in lst:\n        if val > max_val:\n            max_val = val\n    return max_val",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output had a logical error where it returned the first element of the list instead of the maximum element. The refined output incorporates the user feedback and correctly returns the maximum element."
            },
            "Test Case 2": {
                "Problem": "Write a function to sort a list of integers in ascending order.",
                "Baseline Prompt": "Problem: Write a function to sort a list of integers in ascending order.\nGenerate a Python function to solve the above problem.",
                "Baseline Output": "def sort_list(lst):\n    return sorted(lst)",
                "Feedback Prompt": "Generated Code: [baseline output]\nFeedback: The function should implement the sorting algorithm instead of using the built-in sorted() function. Please implement the bubble sort algorithm.",
                "Refined Output": "def sort_list(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            if lst[j] > lst[j + 1]:\n                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]\n    return lst",
                "Explanation": "The baseline output used the built-in sorted() function, which does not demonstrate the implementation of a sorting algorithm. The refined output incorporates the user feedback and implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort the list in ascending order."
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the iterative refinement approach does not yield satisfactory results, we can consider the following alternative plans: 1) Analyze the generated code and user feedback to identify common patterns or challenges in the refinement process. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the current approach and guide the development of alternative strategies. 2) Explore the use of other pre-trained language models or fine-tuning techniques to improve the code generation and refinement capabilities. 3) Investigate the impact of different prompt formats, such as providing more structured guidance or incorporating domain-specific knowledge, on the quality of the generated code. 4) Collect real user feedback instead of simulating it to better understand the effectiveness of the iterative refinement approach in practical scenarios."
