    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models can generate code that is syntactically correct but fails to match the user's intent, often missing key aspects that are not explicitly stated in the instructions but are assumed as common knowledge.",
        "Existing Methods": "Prior work has used techniques like iterative refinement and critique incorporation to improve alignment of generated code with specifications. However, these still rely on the user providing very detailed and unambiguous instructions.",
        "Motivation": "We observe that effective human developers proactively ask questions to elicit and verify requirements before writing any code. We aim to replicate this by prompting LLMs to engage in a grounding dialogue, asking clarifying questions about ambiguous or unstated aspects of the user's intent before attempting to generate code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a multi-turn Code Grounding and Elaboration Prompting approach as follows: 1) Ambiguity Detection Prompt to identify ambiguous/unstated aspects of the instruction, 2) Elaboration Question Prompt to ask the user for clarification on each ambiguous point, 3) User Response Incorporation Prompt to refine the problem understanding based on user responses, and 4) Grounded Code Generation Prompt that incorporates the elaborated problem description. The LLM generates all prompts and responses in this process (except the user clarifications).",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate our approach on a subset of HumanEval and MBPP problems, where we intentionally provide ambiguous/incomplete instructions. We will measure pass@k rates and instruction alignment scores (via human evaluation) compared to baselines of direct prompting and critiquing. We will simulate user responses, but also conduct a small user study to validate the effectiveness of the generated clarification questions."

        "Problem Statement": "Large language models can generate code that is syntactically correct but fails to match the user's intent, often missing key aspects that are not explicitly stated in the instructions but are assumed as common knowledge.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will use a subset of 50 problems each from the HumanEval and MBPP datasets. For each problem, we will manually create an ambiguous/incomplete version of the instructions by removing certain key details that are assumed to be common knowledge.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "1) Ambiguity Detection Prompt: Append the instruction - 'Identify any ambiguities or missing information in the problem description that need to be clarified before generating code. List them as bullet points.' 2) Elaboration Question Prompt: For each identified ambiguity, generate a question to ask the user for clarification. Prompt: 'Generate questions to ask the user to clarify the following ambiguities: <ambiguity_list>' 3) User Response Incorporation Prompt: Update the problem description with the user's responses. Prompt: 'Given the original problem description: <original_description> and the user's clarifications: <user_clarifications>, generate an updated problem description that incorporates the clarifications.' 4) Grounded Code Generation Prompt: Generate code based on the updated problem description. Prompt: 'Generate code to solve the following problem: <updated_description>'",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model for all experiments as it has strong code generation capabilities.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "For each problem, we will: 1) Prompt the model with the ambiguous instruction and get the generated code, 2) Run the Ambiguity Detection Prompt to identify ambiguities, 3) Run the Elaboration Question Prompt to generate clarification questions for each ambiguity, 4) Simulate user responses by manually providing the missing information, 5) Run the User Response Incorporation Prompt to get the updated problem description, 6) Run the Grounded Code Generation Prompt on the updated description to get the final generated code.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "We will evaluate the generated code at each stage (baseline, pre-elaboration, post-elaboration) using the following metrics: 1) Pass@1 rate - percentage of problems where the generated code passes all test cases on first attempt, 2) Instruction alignment score - manually rated score from 1-5 indicating how well the code aligns with the user's intent as described in the full unambiguous instructions. We will compare these metrics before and after the grounding process to measure the impact of our approach."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Original Instruction": "Write a function to sort a list of integers in ascending order.",
                "Ambiguous Instruction": "Write a function to sort a list.",
                "Baseline Output": "def soln(lst):\n    return sorted(lst)",
                "Ambiguity Detection Output": "- What type of elements are in the list? \n- What sorting order should be used?",
                "Elaboration Questions Output": "1) What is the data type of the elements in the input list? 2) Should the list be sorted in ascending or descending order?",
                "User Clarifications": "1) The list contains integers. 2) The list should be sorted in ascending order.",
                "Updated Instruction": "Write a function to sort a list of integers in ascending order.",
                "Grounded Code Output": "def soln(lst):\n    return sorted(lst)"
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Original Instruction": "Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in it. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.",
                "Ambiguous Instruction": "Write a function to count vowels in a string.",
                "Baseline Output": "def soln(string):\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    count = 0\n    for char in string:\n        if char in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count",
                "Ambiguity Detection Output": "- Should both uppercase and lowercase vowels be counted? \n- What is the exact set of characters considered as vowels?",
                "Elaboration Questions Output": "1) Should the function count both uppercase and lowercase vowels? 2) What are the specific characters that should be considered as vowels?",
                "User Clarifications": "1) Yes, both uppercase and lowercase vowels should be counted. 2) The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.",
                "Updated Instruction": "Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) in it. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.",
                "Grounded Code Output": "def soln(string):\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n    count = 0\n    for char in string:\n        if char in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count"
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed grounding approach does not lead to significant improvements in code quality and alignment with user intent, we can: 1) Analyze the generated clarification questions to see if they are identifying the truly ambiguous aspects and generating meaningful questions. If not, we can experiment with alternative prompts for ambiguity detection and question generation. 2) Analyze the updated problem descriptions to see if they are effectively incorporating the user's clarifications. If not, we can try alternative prompts or multi-step approaches for integrating user responses. 3) Collect a dataset of real user interactions (problem statements, clarification questions, user responses) and fine-tune the model on this data to make the grounding process more natural and effective. 4) If the grounding approach still does not yield benefits, we can pivot to an analysis of what types of ambiguities and misalignments are most common, and which ones are challenging for the model to identify and resolve through prompting alone. This can point to future directions combining prompting with other techniques like retrieval or fine-tuning."
