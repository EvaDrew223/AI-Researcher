    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Identifying and correcting errors in code is a common task in software development. Large language models have shown potential in code error detection, but their ability to provide accurate and precise error corrections is still limited.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning the language model on a large corpus of code and their corresponding error corrections. However, these approaches often struggle to capture the syntactic and semantic rules of the programming language, leading to incorrect or suboptimal corrections.",
        "Motivation": "Programming languages have well-defined syntax and semantic rules. By incorporating these rules into the prompting process, we can guide the language model to generate syntactically valid and semantically meaningful error corrections.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a syntax-guided prompting approach for code error correction. Given a code snippet with errors, we first parse the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). Then, we traverse the AST and identify the nodes that contain errors, based on the syntax and semantic rules of the programming language. For each error node, we prompt the model with the surrounding context and the expected syntax and semantic constraints. The prompts guide the model to generate corrections that adhere to the language rules and maintain the overall structure of the code. The corrected code is then validated against the AST to ensure its syntactic and semantic validity.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate the proposed method on code error correction benchmarks, such as the DeepFix and IITK-BPGC datasets. We will compare the performance with baselines such as fine-tuning approaches and rule-based error correction tools. The generated corrections will be evaluated based on correctness, precision, and recall. We will also conduct case studies to analyze the effectiveness of the syntax-guided prompting in handling different types of code errors, such as syntax errors, type errors, and logical errors."

        "Problem Statement": "Identifying and correcting errors in code is a common task in software development. Large language models have shown potential in code error detection, but their ability to provide accurate and precise error corrections is still limited.",

The corrected code is then validated against the AST to ensure its syntactic and semantic validity.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Preparation": "We will use the DeepFix and IITK-BPGC datasets for evaluating the proposed method. These datasets contain code snippets with errors and their corresponding correct versions. We will split the datasets into training, validation, and test sets.",
            "Step 2: AST Parsing and Error Identification": "For each code snippet in the dataset, we will parse it into an AST using a suitable parser for the programming language (e.g., Python AST module for Python code). We will then traverse the AST and identify the nodes that contain errors based on the syntax and semantic rules of the language. We will create a mapping between the error nodes and their corresponding error types.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Generation": "For each error node, we will generate a prompt that includes the surrounding context (e.g., parent and sibling nodes in the AST) and the expected syntax and semantic constraints. The prompts will be designed to guide the model in generating corrections that adhere to the language rules. For example, if the error is a missing semicolon, the prompt could be: \"The following code snippet is missing a semicolon. Please add the semicolon at the appropriate location while maintaining the overall structure of the code: [code snippet]\".",
            "Step 4: Model Selection and Fine-tuning": "We will use a pre-trained large language model, such as GPT-3 or Codex, as the base model. We will fine-tune the model on the training set using the generated prompts and their corresponding correct code snippets. The fine-tuning process will adapt the model to the task of code error correction guided by the syntax and semantic rules.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation": "We will evaluate the fine-tuned model on the test set. For each code snippet in the test set, we will generate the prompts based on the identified error nodes and obtain the model's corrections. We will compare the generated corrections with the ground truth correct code snippets and calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. We will also compare the performance of the proposed method with baseline approaches, such as fine-tuning without syntax guidance and rule-based error correction tools.",
            "Step 6: Error Analysis": "We will conduct an error analysis to understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed method. We will analyze the cases where the model generates incorrect or suboptimal corrections and investigate the reasons behind those errors. We will also examine the model's performance on different types of errors and programming languages to identify any patterns or challenges."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Input": "def calculate_sum(a, b)\n    return a + b",
                "Baseline Output": "def calculate_sum(a, b):\n    return a + b",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method correctly identifies the missing colon and generates the correct code snippet.",
                "Proposed Prompt": "The following code snippet has a syntax error. Please add the missing colon at the appropriate location while maintaining the overall structure of the code:\n\ndef calculate_sum(a, b)\n    return a + b",
                "Proposed Output": "def calculate_sum(a, b):\n    return a + b"
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Input": "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n    if b = 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero!\")\n    else:\n        return a / b",
                "Baseline Output": "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero!\")\n    else:\n        return a / b",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method identifies the semantic error and generates a correction that raises an exception in the case of division by zero, adhering to the expected behavior of the function.",
                "Proposed Prompt": "The following code snippet has a semantic error. The function should return a value or raise an exception in the case of division by zero. Please modify the code to handle the division by zero case appropriately:\n\ndef divide_numbers(a, b):\n    if b = 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero!\")\n    else:\n        return a / b",
                "Proposed Output": "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Error: Division by zero!\")\n    else:\n        return a / b"
            }
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed syntax-guided prompting approach does not yield satisfactory results, we can consider the following alternative plans:\n\n1. Analyze the generated prompts and corrections to identify any limitations or areas for improvement. We can refine the prompt generation process based on the insights gained from the analysis.\n\n2. Experiment with different prompt formats and structures to better capture the syntax and semantic rules of the programming language. We can explore using more fine-grained prompts that target specific types of errors or code constructs.\n\n3. Investigate the impact of the size and quality of the training data on the model's performance. We can collect additional code snippets with diverse error types and programming languages to improve the model's generalization ability.\n\n4. Consider combining the proposed method with other techniques, such as data augmentation or adversarial training, to enhance the model's robustness and ability to handle challenging error cases.\n\n5. If the proposed method still does not meet the desired performance, we can pivot the project to focus on analyzing the limitations and challenges of using large language models for code error correction. We can conduct a comprehensive study to identify the common pitfalls, such as the model's tendency to generate syntactically valid but semantically incorrect corrections, and provide insights for future research directions in this area."
