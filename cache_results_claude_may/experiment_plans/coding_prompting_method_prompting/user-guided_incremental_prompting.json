    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Code generation models often struggle to capture the specific requirements and preferences of individual users. Incorporating user feedback and guidance into the generation process could help tailor the generated code to better meet user expectations.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing code generation methods typically rely on a fixed set of prompts or examples, without considering the specific needs and preferences of individual users.",
        "Motivation": "By allowing users to guide the code generation process through incremental prompts and feedback, the model can learn to generate code that better aligns with the user's specific requirements, coding style, and design preferences.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a User-Guided Incremental Prompting (UGIP) method for code generation. The process involves multiple rounds of user interaction and code refinement: 1) Initial Prompt: The user provides an initial prompt describing the desired code functionality. 2) Code Generation: The model generates an initial version of the code based on the user's prompt. 3) User Feedback: The user reviews the generated code and provides feedback, which may include corrections, suggestions, or additional requirements. 4) Incremental Prompting: The model incorporates the user's feedback and generates an updated version of the code. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the user is satisfied with the generated code. UGIP allows for a collaborative and iterative code generation process, where the user can guide the model towards generating code that meets their specific needs.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Conduct a user study where participants use UGIP to generate code for a variety of programming tasks. Compare the quality and user satisfaction of the code generated using UGIP with baseline methods. Evaluate the effectiveness of the incremental prompting process in capturing user requirements and preferences. Analyze the generated code for correctness, efficiency, and alignment with user expectations."

        "Title": "User-Guided Incremental Prompting for Tailored Code Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Code generation models often struggle to capture the specific requirements and preferences of individual users, resulting in generated code that may not fully meet user expectations or align with their coding style and design preferences.",
        "Motivation": "Existing code generation methods typically rely on a fixed set of prompts or examples, without considering the specific needs and preferences of individual users. By allowing users to guide the code generation process through incremental prompts and feedback, the model can learn to generate code that better aligns with the user's specific requirements, coding style, and design preferences. This collaborative and iterative approach enables a more personalized and effective code generation experience.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose a User-Guided Incremental Prompting (UGIP) method for code generation. The process involves multiple rounds of user interaction and code refinement:\n1. Initial Prompt: The user provides an initial prompt describing the desired code functionality.\n2. Code Generation: The model generates an initial version of the code based on the user's prompt.\n3. User Feedback: The user reviews the generated code and provides feedback, which may include corrections, suggestions, or additional requirements.\n4. Incremental Prompting: The model incorporates the user's feedback and generates an updated version of the code.\nSteps 3 and 4 are repeated until the user is satisfied with the generated code. UGIP allows for a collaborative and iterative code generation process, where the user can guide the model towards generating code that meets their specific needs.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will use the HumanEval dataset, which consists of 164 hand-written programming problems with corresponding solutions in Python. Each problem includes a function signature, docstring, body, and several test cases. We will randomly select 50 problems from the dataset for our experiments.",
            "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "We will compare UGIP with two baseline methods:\n1. Direct Prompting: The model generates code based on the initial user prompt without any further interaction or refinement.\n2. Few-Shot Prompting: The model is provided with a few examples of similar coding tasks and their solutions before generating code for the target task.",
            "Step 3: Prompt Construction": "For each problem, we will construct the following prompts:\n1. Initial Prompt: The function signature and docstring will be used as the initial prompt.\n2. User Feedback Prompts: We will simulate user feedback by manually reviewing the generated code and providing corrections, suggestions, or additional requirements. The feedback will be appended to the previous prompt for incremental prompting.",
            "Step 4: Model Selection": "We will use the OpenAI Codex model (code-davinci-002) for code generation. The model will be accessed through the OpenAI API.",
            "Step 5: Evaluation Metrics": "We will evaluate the generated code using the following metrics:\n1. Functional Correctness: The percentage of test cases passed by the generated code.\n2. Code Quality: A subjective assessment of the code's readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.\n3. User Satisfaction: A simulated user satisfaction score based on how well the generated code meets the specified requirements and preferences.",
            "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each problem:\n1. Generate code using the baseline methods (Direct Prompting and Few-Shot Prompting).\n2. Generate code using UGIP with 3 rounds of user feedback and incremental prompting.\n3. Evaluate the generated code using the defined metrics.\n4. Record the results for each method.",
            "Step 7: Result Analysis": "1. Compare the performance of UGIP against the baseline methods using the evaluation metrics.\n2. Analyze the impact of incremental prompting and user feedback on code quality and user satisfaction.\n3. Identify strengths and limitations of UGIP based on the experimental results."

            "Test Case 1": {
                "Problem": "Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.",

                "Explanation": "The baseline method using few-shot prompting generates a correct solution that ignores case sensitivity and non-alphanumeric characters. UGIP further improves the code by incorporating user feedback to use two pointers for better readability and performance, resulting in a more optimized solution."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UGIP method does not significantly outperform the baseline methods, we can consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the user feedback and generated code to identify potential limitations or areas for improvement in the incremental prompting process.\n2. Experiment with different types of user feedback, such as providing more specific guidance or examples, to see if it enhances the effectiveness of UGIP.\n3. Explore alternative code generation models or techniques that may be better suited for incorporating user preferences and requirements.\n4. Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the generated code to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of UGIP compared to the baseline methods.\n5. If UGIP does not consistently outperform the baselines, focus on understanding the factors that contribute to its performance and present the findings as an analysis paper, highlighting the challenges and opportunities for future research in user-guided code generation."
