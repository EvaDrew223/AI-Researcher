        "Problem": "Generating complex code snippets that involve multiple steps, functions, or classes can be challenging for large language models, often leading to inconsistencies and errors.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for code generation typically attempt to generate the entire code snippet in one go, without explicitly breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.",
        "Motivation": "By prompting the model to decompose a complex coding task into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, we can guide the model to generate code in a structured and modular manner. This approach can help the model maintain consistency, handle dependencies between code components, and generate more organized and readable code.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Code Decomposition Prompting (CDP) for complex code generation. CDP prompts the model to break down a complex coding task into smaller sub-problems. The model is prompted to identify the main components or functions required to solve the task and generate code for each sub-problem separately. The prompts include instructions to define interfaces between the sub-problems, handle dependencies, and ensure compatibility. The model then combines the generated code for the sub-problems to form the final solution. The prompts also encourage the model to provide explanations and comments for each sub-problem to enhance code readability.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CDP on complex code generation benchmarks that involve multiple steps or functions, such as APPS and CodeContests. Measure the correctness and modularity of the generated code. Assess the quality of the code decomposition and the clarity of the generated explanations through human evaluation. Compare CDP with baseline methods that generate code without explicit decomposition."

        "Problem Statement": "Generating complex code snippets that involve multiple steps, functions, or classes can be challenging for large language models, often leading to inconsistencies and errors.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for code generation typically attempt to generate the entire code snippet in one go, without explicitly breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems. This can lead to issues such as inconsistencies between different parts of the generated code, difficulty in handling dependencies between code components, and lack of modularity and readability in the generated code. By prompting the model to decompose a complex coding task into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, we can guide the model to generate code in a structured and modular manner. This approach can help the model maintain consistency, handle dependencies between code components, and generate more organized and readable code.",

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate CDP on complex code generation benchmarks that involve multiple steps or functions, such as APPS and CodeContests. These datasets contain coding problems that require the generation of multiple functions or classes to solve the task.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For the baseline method, use a simple prompt that asks the model to generate the entire code snippet for the given problem. For CDP, create a set of prompts that guide the model to decompose the problem into sub-problems. The prompts should include the following steps:\n1. Identify the main components or functions required to solve the problem.\n2. For each component or function:\n   a. Generate the code for the sub-problem.\n   b. Define the input and output interfaces for the sub-problem.\n   c. Handle dependencies between the sub-problem and other components.\n   d. Provide explanations and comments for the sub-problem.\n3. Combine the generated code for the sub-problems to form the final solution.\n4. Ensure compatibility and consistency between the sub-problems.",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 for the experiments. These models have shown strong performance on code generation tasks.",
            "Step 4: Get Results": "Generate code snippets using both the baseline method and CDP for the selected datasets. For each problem, compare the generated code snippets in terms of correctness, modularity, and readability.",
            "Step 5: Analyze Results": "Measure the correctness of the generated code snippets by running them against the test cases provided in the datasets. Assess the modularity of the code by examining the structure and organization of the generated code. Evaluate the readability of the code by considering factors such as code comments, variable naming, and overall code structure. Compare the results of CDP with the baseline method to determine if CDP leads to improved code generation performance."

            "Explanation": "The baseline method generates the entire code snippet in one go, without breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems. While the generated code is correct, it lacks modularity and readability. On the other hand, CDP guides the model to decompose the problem into smaller sub-problems, generate code for each sub-problem separately, and combine them to form the final solution. The resulting code is more modular, readable, and easier to understand. The explanations and comments provided for each sub-problem further enhance the readability of the code."
        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed CDP method does not lead to significant improvements in code generation performance compared to the baseline, consider the following alternative plans:\n1. Analyze the generated code snippets to identify common patterns or issues that may be hindering the effectiveness of CDP. This analysis can provide insights into potential areas for improvement in the prompting strategy.\n2. Experiment with different variations of the CDP prompts, such as modifying the level of granularity in problem decomposition or providing more specific guidance on handling dependencies between sub-problems. These variations can help fine-tune the prompting approach to better suit the characteristics of the coding problems.\n3. Investigate the impact of model size and architecture on the performance of CDP. Experiment with different models, such as GPT-3.5 with varying sizes or alternative architectures like Codex, to assess if certain models are more amenable to the CDP approach.\n4. Conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated code snippets to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of CDP. This analysis can involve manual evaluation by experienced programmers who can provide feedback on the quality, readability, and maintainability of the generated code.\n5. If the CDP approach does not yield satisfactory results, consider pivoting the project to focus on an in-depth analysis of the challenges in complex code generation. This analysis can explore the limitations of current language models in handling multi-step coding problems, the impact of problem complexity on generation quality, and potential strategies for mitigating these challenges.\nBy considering these alternative plans, the project can adapt to the findings and provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of problem decomposition techniques for complex code generation tasks."
