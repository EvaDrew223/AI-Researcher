    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Large language models often generate code that is syntactically correct but fails to meet the functional requirements or contains logical errors.",
        "Existing Methods": "Current methods for code generation primarily rely on providing natural language descriptions or input-output examples to guide the model.",
        "Motivation": "By executing the generated code and comparing the actual output with the expected output, the model can receive feedback on the functional correctness of the code. This feedback can then be used to iteratively refine the generated code until it meets the desired requirements.",
        "Proposed Method": "We propose Execution-Guided Prompting (EGP) for code generation. Given a programming task, EGP first prompts the model to generate an initial code solution. The generated code is then executed in a controlled environment, and the actual output is compared with the expected output. If there is a mismatch, the model is prompted to analyze the error and generate a refined version of the code. This process is repeated iteratively until the generated code produces the expected output. The prompts at each iteration include the original task description, the previously generated code, the execution error (if any), and instructions to refine the code based on the feedback.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate EGP on code generation benchmarks such as APPS and HumanEval. Compare the performance of EGP with baseline methods such as direct prompting and exemplar-based prompting. Measure the functional correctness and efficiency of the generated code using metrics like pass@k and average number of iterations required to generate correct code."

        "Title": "Execution-Guided Prompting for Improved Code Generation",
        "Problem Statement": "Large language models often generate code that is syntactically correct but fails to meet the functional requirements or contains logical errors.",
        "Motivation": "Current methods for code generation primarily rely on providing natural language descriptions or input-output examples to guide the model. However, these approaches do not directly incorporate feedback on the functional correctness of the generated code. By executing the generated code and comparing the actual output with the expected output, the model can receive feedback on the functional correctness of the code. This feedback can then be used to iteratively refine the generated code until it meets the desired requirements. Execution-guided prompting allows the model to learn from its mistakes and progressively improve the generated code based on the feedback obtained from code execution.",
        "Proposed Method": "Execution-Guided Prompting (EGP) is an iterative code generation approach that leverages the model's ability to execute and refine its own generated code. Given a programming task, EGP first prompts the model to generate an initial code solution. The generated code is then executed in a controlled environment, and the actual output is compared with the expected output. If there is a mismatch, the model is prompted to analyze the error and generate a refined version of the code. This process is repeated iteratively until the generated code produces the expected output. The prompts at each iteration include the original task description, the previously generated code, the execution error (if any), and instructions to refine the code based on the feedback.",
        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "Evaluate EGP on code generation benchmarks such as APPS and HumanEval. APPS contains 10,000 coding problems with test cases, while HumanEval consists of 164 hand-written programming problems with test cases.",
            "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "For the baseline methods, use direct prompting by providing the problem description and input-output examples (if available). For exemplar-based prompting, include a few examples of similar coding problems and their solutions in the prompt.\nFor EGP, construct prompts for each iteration as follows:\n- Initial Prompt: Include the problem description, input-output examples (if available), and instructions to generate a code solution.\n- Refinement Prompts: Include the original problem description, the previously generated code, the execution error (if any), and instructions to refine the code based on the feedback. Example refinement prompt:\n\"Problem: {problem_description}\nPrevious Code:\n{previous_code}\nExecution Error: {execution_error}\nInstructions: Analyze the execution error and refine the code to address the issue. Generate an improved version of the code that produces the expected output.\"",
            "Step 3: Select Models": "Use GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002) and GPT-4 for code generation. These models have shown strong performance on coding tasks.",
            "Step 4: Implement Execution Environment": "Set up a controlled execution environment to run the generated code and compare the actual output with the expected output. Use the test cases provided in the APPS and HumanEval datasets to evaluate the functional correctness of the code.",
            "Step 5: Run Experiments": "For each coding problem in the datasets, perform the following steps:\n- Baseline Methods:\n  - Direct Prompting: Prompt the model with the problem description and input-output examples (if available) to generate a code solution.\n  - Exemplar-Based Prompting: Prompt the model with the problem description, input-output examples (if available), and a few examples of similar coding problems and their solutions to generate a code solution.\n- EGP:\n  - Initial Generation: Prompt the model with the initial prompt to generate a code solution.\n  - Iterative Refinement: Execute the generated code and compare the actual output with the expected output. If there is a mismatch, prompt the model with the refinement prompt to generate an improved version of the code. Repeat this process until the generated code produces the expected output or a maximum number of iterations is reached.",
            "Step 6: Evaluate Results": "Measure the performance of EGP and the baseline methods using the following metrics:\n- Pass@k: The percentage of problems for which the model generates a correct solution within k iterations (e.g., Pass@1, Pass@5).\n- Average Iterations: The average number of iterations required to generate a correct solution.\n- Execution Accuracy: The percentage of generated code solutions that pass all the test cases.\nCompare the results of EGP with the baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of execution-guided prompting in improving code generation quality."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Problem": "Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.",
                "Baseline Prompt Input": "Problem: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.",
                "Baseline Prompt Expected Output": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]",
                "EGP Initial Prompt Input": "Problem: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.",
                "EGP Initial Prompt Expected Output": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n        if s[i] != s[-i - 1]:\n            return False\n    return True",

No further refinement is needed.",
                "EGP Refinement Prompt Expected Output": "def is_palindrome(s):\n    for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n        if s[i] != s[-i - 1]:\n            return False\n    return True",
                "Explanation": "The baseline method generates a correct solution using string slicing, while EGP generates a correct solution using a loop. Both solutions pass all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the models in generating functionally correct code."

            "Example 2": {
                "Problem": "Write a function to find the maximum subarray sum in a given array.",

                "Explanation": "The baseline method generates a brute-force solution with O(n^3) time complexity. EGP initially generates a solution with O(n^2) time complexity. After receiving feedback on efficiency, EGP refines the code to generate a solution with O(n) time complexity using Kadane's algorithm. This demonstrates the ability of EGP to iteratively improve the generated code based on feedback."

        },
        "Fallback Plan": "If EGP does not outperform the baseline methods, consider the following alternative approaches:\n1. Analyze the generated code and execution errors to identify common patterns or challenges faced by the model. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the current approach and guide the development of alternative methods.\n2. Investigate the impact of different prompt designs on the performance of EGP. Experiment with variations in the prompt structure, such as including more context, providing clearer instructions, or incorporating domain-specific knowledge.\n3. Explore the use of intermediate feedback during the code generation process. Instead of waiting for the complete code to be generated before executing it, provide feedback at intermediate steps to guide the model towards generating correct code incrementally.\n4. Consider incorporating additional techniques, such as program synthesis or code search, to assist the model in generating correct code. These techniques can be used in conjunction with EGP to provide additional guidance and improve the quality of the generated code.\n5. If the performance of EGP remains unsatisfactory, focus on analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify the types of errors made by the model and the challenges it faces in generating correct code. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the limitations of current code generation methods and highlight potential areas for future research."
