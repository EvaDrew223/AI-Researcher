    "idea_name": "User Feedback-Driven Prompting for Code Generation",
    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "Current code generation methods often produce code that is correct but may not meet the user's specific requirements or preferences. The generated code may be inefficient, hard to read, or not adhere to certain coding styles or conventions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Existing methods for code generation typically aim to produce correct code given a problem description and input/output examples. Some recent works have explored incorporating user feedback, but they often require fine-tuning the model on the feedback data.",
        "Motivation": "We propose to incorporate user feedback into the prompting process for code generation. By allowing the user to provide iterative feedback on the generated code, we can guide the model to refine the code to better meet the user's requirements and preferences.",
        "Proposed Method": "We introduce User Feedback-Driven Prompting (UFDP) for code generation. Given a coding problem, we first prompt the model to generate an initial solution. We then present this solution to the user and ask for feedback. The user can provide feedback in various forms, such as suggesting improvements, pointing out errors, or specifying additional requirements. We then incorporate this feedback into the prompt and ask the model to refine the code accordingly. This process is repeated for multiple iterations until the user is satisfied with the generated code. The key idea is to leverage user feedback to guide the model to generate code that not only solves the problem but also meets the user's specific needs and preferences.",
        "Experiment Plan": "We will evaluate UFDP on coding problems from various domains, such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning. We will recruit experienced programmers to provide feedback during the code generation process. We will compare our approach with standard prompting methods that do not incorporate user feedback, as well as fine-tuning baselines that train on user feedback data. The key evaluation metrics will be the quality and usability of the generated code, as well as the user satisfaction and engagement in the feedback process. We will also conduct qualitative analyses to understand the types and impact of user feedback on the code generation process."

        "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
            "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will use coding problems from various domains, such as web development (e.g., TodoMVC), data analysis (e.g., Pandas), and machine learning (e.g., Scikit-learn). For each domain, we will select 50 diverse problems that cover a range of difficulties and requirements.",
            "Step 2: Recruit Participants": "We will recruit 20 experienced programmers (>3 years of experience) to provide feedback during the code generation process. Each participant will be assigned 10 coding problems (2 from each domain) and will be asked to provide feedback for each problem until they are satisfied with the generated code.",
            "Step 3: Construct Prompts": "For each coding problem, we will create an initial prompt that includes the problem description, input/output examples, and any additional requirements (e.g., time/space complexity, coding style). We will also create a feedback prompt template that incorporates the user's feedback and instructs the model to refine the code accordingly.",
            "Step 4: Select Models": "We will use GPT-4 and Codex (code-davinci-002) as our code generation models. We will compare the performance of these models in terms of the quality and usability of the generated code, as well as the number of feedback iterations required to satisfy the users.",
            "Step 5: Generate Initial Code": "For each coding problem, we will prompt the selected models with the initial prompt to generate the initial code solution.",
            "Step 6: Collect User Feedback": "We will present the initial code solution to the assigned participant and ask them to provide feedback. The feedback can be in the form of natural language comments, suggestions, or code snippets.",
            "Step 7: Refine Code": "We will incorporate the user's feedback into the feedback prompt and prompt the models to refine the code based on the feedback. We will repeat steps 6 and 7 until the user is satisfied with the generated code or a maximum of 5 iterations is reached.",
            "Step 8: Evaluate Results": "We will evaluate the quality and usability of the final generated code using both automated metrics (e.g., code correctness, time/space complexity) and user ratings (e.g., readability, adherence to requirements). We will compare the performance of UFDP with standard prompting methods that do not incorporate user feedback, as well as fine-tuning baselines that train on user feedback data.",
            "Step 9: Analyze Feedback": "We will conduct qualitative analyses to understand the types of feedback provided by the users and how they impact the code generation process. We will also analyze the feedback incorporation strategies used by the models and identify areas for improvement."

        "Test Case Examples": {
            "Example 1": {
                "Problem": "Implement a Python function to find the longest common subsequence between two strings.",
                "Initial Prompt": "Write a Python function to find the longest common subsequence between two strings. The function should take two strings as input and return the longest common subsequence as a string. For example, given the strings 'ABCDGH' and 'AEDFHR', the function should return 'ADH'.",
                "Baseline Output": "def lcs(str1, str2):\n m = len(str1)\n n = len(str2)\n dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n for i in range(1, m + 1):\n for j in range(1, n + 1):\n if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n else:\n dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n lcs = ''\n i, j = m, n\n while i > 0 and j > 0:\n if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n lcs = str1[i - 1] + lcs\n i -= 1\n j -= 1\n elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:\n i -= 1\n else:\n j -= 1\n return lcs",
                "User Feedback": "The code looks correct, but it's not very readable. Can you add comments to explain the dynamic programming approach and use more descriptive variable names?",

                "Explanation": "The baseline output is correct but lacks readability. The refined output incorporates the user's feedback by adding comments to explain the dynamic programming approach and using more descriptive variable names, making the code easier to understand."
            },
            "Example 2": {
                "Problem": "Implement a Python class for a bank account that supports deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry operations.",
                "Initial Prompt": "Implement a Python class called BankAccount that represents a bank account. The class should have methods for depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the account balance. The class should also keep track of the account holder's name and account number.",
                "Baseline Output": "class BankAccount:\n def __init__(self, name, account_number):\n self.name = name\n self.account_number = account_number\n self.balance = 0\n def deposit(self, amount):\n self.balance += amount\n def withdraw(self, amount):\n if amount <= self.balance:\n self.balance -= amount\n else:\n print('Insufficient funds')\n def check_balance(self):\n return self.balance",
                "User Feedback": "The code looks good, but it would be better to raise an exception when there are insufficient funds for a withdrawal instead of just printing a message. Also, can you add a method to display the account holder's information?",
                "Refined Output": "class BankAccount:\n def __init__(self, name, account_number):\n self.name = name\n self.account_number = account_number\n self.balance = 0\n def deposit(self, amount):\n if amount > 0:\n self.balance += amount\n else:\n raise ValueError('Deposit amount must be positive')\n def withdraw(self, amount):\n if amount > 0:\n if amount <= self.balance:\n self.balance -= amount\n else:\n raise ValueError('Insufficient funds')\n else:\n raise ValueError('Withdrawal amount must be positive')\n def check_balance(self):\n return self.balance\n def display_info(self):\n print(f'Account Holder: {self.name}')\n print(f'Account Number: {self.account_number}')\n print(f'Balance: ${self.balance}')",
                "Explanation": "The refined output incorporates the user's feedback by raising exceptions for invalid deposit and withdrawal amounts and when there are insufficient funds. It also adds a display_info method to show the account holder's information. These changes make the code more robust and user-friendly."

        "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed UFDP method does not outperform the baselines, we can conduct additional analyses to understand the reasons behind the suboptimal performance. Some potential areas to investigate include:\n1. Feedback Quality: Analyze the quality and relevance of the user feedback. If the feedback is not informative or actionable, it may not lead to meaningful improvements in the generated code. We can provide more guidance to the participants on how to provide effective feedback.\n2. Feedback Incorporation: Examine how well the models incorporate the user feedback into the refined code. If the models struggle to understand or act upon the feedback, we can explore alternative feedback incorporation strategies or prompt engineering techniques.\n3. Domain-Specific Challenges: Investigate if certain domains or problem types pose particular challenges for UFDP. We can analyze the performance across different domains and identify areas where the method may need adaptation or improvement.\n4. Model Limitations: Assess if the limitations of the selected models impact the effectiveness of UFDP. We can experiment with alternative models or fine-tuning strategies to see if they can better leverage the user feedback.\nBased on the findings from these analyses, we can propose modifications to the UFDP method or develop new approaches that address the identified challenges. If the results still do not meet the desired performance level, we can pivot the project to focus on understanding the limitations of user feedback in the code generation process and provide insights for future research directions."
