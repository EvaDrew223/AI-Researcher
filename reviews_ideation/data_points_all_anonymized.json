        "There is a lot of existing work on semantic change that uses more sophisticated methods than prompting, see works in the LChange Workshop (https://aclanthology.org/venues/lchange/). I think pure prompting is a strictly worse way of studying semantic change than previous works that use novel ideas like tracking embedding shift over time, across several pretrained models.",
        "(Only an educated guess). The temporal semantic graph thing does not seem to be too much a new thing in addition to just including the current meaning of the phrases in the prompts.",
        "The proposed method is not very different from CoT-SC (Wang et al., 2023, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11171), Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10601), and Graph of Thoughts (Besta et al., 2024, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09687). Especially, ToT also has an evaluation step in the pipeline, but on the node level.",
        "\"Multiple Chains of Reasoning\" is a paper that already exists, focusing on meta-reasoning over multiple chains. It emphasizes divergent thinking rather than a linear thought structure concerning these inputs. Therefore, the proposed work does not appear to present novelty in terms of the prompt, the described structure, or the datasets on which it is tested on. Exactly related work: Answering Questions by Meta-Reasoning over Multiple Chains of Thought by Ori Yoran, Tomer Wolfson, Ben Bogin, Uri Katz, Daniel Deutch, Jonathan Berant",
        "Personally, I am not aware of similar works that describe an imaginary world where the stereotype or polarity is reversed. I do not find closely related works after a quick search on google scholar or ACL anthology using keywords \"Conceptual Polarity Reversal\" or \"Stereotype Inverse.\" I'm fairly confident that the proposed approach is different from the existing works.   After thinking further about the idea, I think it is similar to debiasing LLMs with some counter-factual descriptions in the input prompt. However, I do not know similar papers off the top of my mind now. ",
        "The specific prompt proposed here (\u201cImagine a world where\u2026\u201d) is novel, but the idea of using prompts that get the model to be more reflective has been thoroughly explored. I\u2019m skeptical that this is sufficiently different from these previous approaches to have either a much better result or to apply to a broader class of problems. See, for example (a somewhat random sample, as there are many of these papers): https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02030 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17218 https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08743 https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18786",
        "I cannot name a paper but this idea is simply wrong. ",
        "The method proposed is to break down a long document (case study: Requirements Analysis of an Industrial SRS Document) into subsections smaller in size, and prompt an LLM for each of the subsections for defects. Then, the prompt defects are rephrased into questions which will then be used to prompt an LLM for verifying whether the defect is a false positive.  While this is an interesting idea, I don't think it will make enough novelty for a research paper. If sufficient Engineering efforts are involved to this project, it might make an useful demo paper.",
        "The idea is essentially a synthetic generation pipeline specifically for SRS. There is a large body of work around synthetic data so the novelty is mostly limited to just the domain of SRS.",
        "This work proposes to reduce the false positives in SRS Document defects detection with LLMs by generating relevant yes/no question prompts on potential defects for each section of the document and prompt the LLM with them to simplify the task and the verification process, which aims to overcome the long-context challenge when directly feeding the SRS document to the LLM. The application of such prompting design to SRS Document defects detection is somewhat new, however, such divide-and-conquer idea for prompting in general is not novel and there are many similar ideas in previous literature.",
        "I am confident there should be many papers doing this human-inspired bi-extreme placement experiments to quantify model uncertainty (though not necessarily for GPT-4, but if the difference is only in GPT-3.5/4/x, the novelty would be even more limited) or, generally, multi-extreme placement as in many cases (e.g., multi-choice QA), there won't be just two extremes. In this sense, role-playing/debates would be another more general scenarios for that uncertainty quantification and there has been significant amount of efforts in this field. So this idea is not novel at all. ",
        "I'm not familiar with existing work that focuses on guiding an LLM through a reasoning process to determine uncertainty (in this case, considering two poles and then deciding). I've seen more papers that focus on asking the question multiple times (perhaps with paraphrasing) and pooling, asking for a uncertainty value directly, looking at distribution of output logits, etc. But I could be missing part of the literature here.",
        "The notion of asking an LLM to identify key aspects of the input text and then use them for further analysis/text generation is not novel. Asking the LLM to construct a semantic network might be novel. Using LLM + graphs for low resource languages is not novel (e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11804).",
        "I am not very familiar with the literature in this field but after some literature search, the closest one I can find is [1]. I think the proposed idea is still quite different from this since it focuses on translation task.  [1] Teaching Large Language Models to Translate on Low-resource Languages with Textbook Prompting, IREC-COLING 2024",
        "This work is pretty novel compared to the other works in this area. However, it has some similarities with research in building a \"Multilingual Knowledge Graph.",
        "The idea to use perceptibility using LLM is interesting.",
        "The proposed idea and framework of using a fog of phrases with varied semantics, inspired by red-teaming techniques from vision, which is clearly novel and makes major differences from all existing ideas. However, fundamentally, the notion of stochastically modifying adversarial prompts by substituting similar concepts is very similar to existing studies, such as: (Su et al., 2024) https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01420. Therefore a score of 7 (between 6 and 8) is given.",
        "The concept-aware prompting can be beneficial to conduct reasoning in accordance with the hierarchical nature of mathematical knowledge. However, there are already several works that derive high-level concepts and first principles to enhance mathematical reasoning. For example, [1] propose step-back prompting which uses concepts and principles to guide reasoning. [2] propose self-discover prompting to conduct hierarchical reasoning following self-composed reasoning structures of LLMs.  [1] Zheng H., Mishra S., Chen X., et al. Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models. ICLR 2024 [2] Zhou P., Pujara J., Ren X., et al. SELF-DISCOVER: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.03620, 2024.",
        "I don't think there is a similar work to this \"hierarchical concept\". But to be honest I feel this is basically just a more complicated version of chain of thought (before cot, let's first output some concepts).",
        "Combining neural methods with symbolic reasoning to improve parsing for low-resource languages and vernaculars is a novel approach. While neuro-symbolic methods have been explored in other contexts, their application to parsing these specific language forms is not widely covered, offering fresh insights and potential advancements in the field.",
        "There hasn't been a work leveraging symbolic grammar rules for vernacular parsing in in-context learning setting. ",
        "While the framework of debiasing based by prompt engineering is well known, the idea of trying to reach deeply embedded stereotypes in models by bringing up pretty unrelated analogies about the bias concepts in questions seems wildly novel! I would be very excited to see the results of this experiment.",
        "Using different persona as role-playing prompt for LLMs is widely used. However, potentially, it can be effective in bias mitigation. The selected datasets are limited. Only close-source LLMs are used.",
        "The idea proposed by the paper is called \"pivot prompts.\" It is very similar to in-context learning, but the key difference is that you are not learning from the examples. Instead, you are using certain sentences to drive the latent space from which you generate responses. While this concept may not be entirely novel in the broader context of using LLMs, it is something I haven't previously seen used to address bias issues in LLM responses. ",
        "The construction of Temporal Graph sounds novel.  The research question is also relatively under explored, but necessary for coding in domains like distributed system.",
        "Although I am not entirely familiar with the field of generating temporally adaptive programs, I suspect some similar ideas can be found in software engineering works (e.g., ICSE). More concretely on the method, it is rather similar to code generation with intermediate state reasoning, which has been explored in several multi-step, conversational code generation works, e.g., [1,2,3] [1] Zheng, Tianyu, et al. \"Opencodeinterpreter: Integrating code generation with execution and refinement.\" [2] Cao, Liuwen, et al. \"Beyond Code: Evaluate Thought Steps for Complex Code Generation.\" Proceedings of the 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-COLING 2024). 2024. [3] Nijkamp, Erik, et al. \"Codegen: An open large language model for code with multi-turn program synthesis.\" ",
        "This idea studies a very novel problem in LLM-based code generation. Temporal dependencies in code generation should be specifically studied in era if LLMs.",
        "incorporating the tracking of execution states and using robust example test cases to improve code generation focuses on ensuring the generated code not only compiles but also behaves as expected in various scenarios. Execution-Guided Neural Program Synthesis has similar methodologies but not the same.",
        "While it draws inspiration from Chain of Thought (CoT), it represents a novel idea by combining tool use with compilers, iterative improvement of the code, and multi-step reasoning. Additionally, it has the potential to exceed on existing coding benchmarks which rely primarily on additional sampling.",
        "After doing some googling, this paper seems to be quite related, and also includes a method to train models to reason through execution traces: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14662. I don't think there are a few implementation details that are different though (e.g. whether the model is zero-shot prompted or not, how the test cases are generated, etc.)",
        "The research topic of using large, poorly documented, or rapidly evolving APIs for code generation is timely and important. While existing works try to enhance LMs ability in handling large-scale APIs via a data-driven fashion, I agree it's worth exploring symbolic methods to somewhat deterministically handle large-scale APIs.",
        "Combining neural and symbolic methods is an interesting direction and based on the descriptions it is suitable for coding applications.",
        "The idea falls under the self-refine category of works. This work reminds me of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09267 (Self-alignment for factuality: Mitigating hallucinations in llms via self-evaluation, Zhang et al. 2024). They also perform sampling and ask questions. However, one difference is that the proposed idea asks multiple choice questions with different contexts.",
        "The novelty is lacking as it is simply the voting trick that people are using currently (i.e., sampling a bunch of generations, and get the majority vote, or sampling a bunch of generations, and use external models to rate, or self-rate)",
        "While the idea is novel, I believe the novelty stems from the fact that it proposes something that is completely, or at least slightly, infeasible with the current models and parameters we have access to. This is likely why it hasn't been implemented before. Although the concept of basing hallucinations on confidence and non-consensus is interesting, both factors are very subjective and not grounded in literature. ",
        "The idea is marginally novel. Multilinguality as a debiasing method has already been considered in the literature, although not necessarily in the prompt engineering framework. Eg: Aha and Oh 2021 (Mitigating Language-Dependent Ethnic Bias in BERT), Levy et al. 2023 (Comparing Biases and the Impact of Multilingual Training across Multiple Languages).",
        "It's hard to comment on the novelty of the proposed idea because it is not clear to me what the exact problem the method is trying to address. It does not make sense to me in step (5) to \"mitigate inconsistencies by generating a new response that incorporates answers from different perspectives.\" Why would a user expect the model to describe wedding attires in a non-English speaking country when they ask the question in English and never specify the culture? Is the model supposed to tell me the wedding attire in every culture in the world to be considered fair? The problem is poorly formulated in the proposal and it is unclear what the ideal model behavior should be for cultural fairness and inclusiveness. Overall I don't think the proposal is well-motivated.   Some relevant work also compare the model's differential behavior towards various cultures. However, I don't think they have parallel questions in multiple languages.  Shramay Palta and Rachel Rudinger. 2023.

        "Novel in the sense that it tries to use the structural and functional features. Not novel in the sense it tries to build effective few-shot methods.",
        "This work is reasonably novel.  The idea of creating vectors to cluster typologically similar languages has been explored before: https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.187.pdf but primarily used to select training data distributions for training a multilingual translation model that is better suited to particular low resource languages.  I have not found much related work on typological prompting and this idea seems relatively novel and interesting.",
        "I think this idea is interesting in that it contains an interplay between neural and something more structure --- a lattice structure. However, due to the lack of both the description and missing generation example, it is hard for me to tell what actual benefit lattice brings to the game.",
        "I'm not familiar with existing work that focuses on guiding an LLM through a reasoning process to determine uncertainty (in this case, creating a lattice of concepts related to the question and composing uncertainty on nodes/edges of the lattice). I've seen more papers that focus on asking the question multiple times (perhaps with paraphrasing) and pooling, asking for a uncertainty value directly, looking at distribution of output logits, etc. But I could be missing part of the literature here. ",
        "There have been (just) 1-2 recent papers on cultural awareness in LLMs. However, this is a relatively new problem, and both collecting new data and in new languages is very important, particularly lower-resource languages where this is unlikely to exist and harder to collect. In addition, including human evaluation here is an important step, as automatic metrics are unlikely to accurately to be able capture cultural awareness.",
        "Culturally-Specific Task is definitely a hot keyword, but the methods like CoT seems not very noble. ",
        "I don't think any work has tried this due to the specificity of the task and the unusual domain for using CoT in. I can't even find much work on CoT for machine translation, which surprised me! This seems quite novel overall.",
        "The use of chain-of-thought in low resource languages is not widely explored -- it is shown that CoT is less effective and lower quality in low-resource languages but there's not yet a standard way to improve performance. Using phonetic cues to increase the quality of the generated CoT, instead of transfer learning, seems to be a novel approach to tackle this issue. However, the approach relies on a few assumption, e.g., the ability to identify phonetic patterns and the connections between phonetic features. ",
        "I don't quite get the novelty here. The idea of \"multiple perspective\" is already illustrated in Figure 2 of Self Refine (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17651). Adding a round of final check is also a trivial engineering trick.",
        "This idea is reasonably novel, but it does not bring a fundamental change to how the problem is solved in mathematical reasoning tasks. Having an error taxonomy add to its novelty.",
        "This shares a quite similar idea to: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00994 however this paper was only released 6 days ago, and will be presented at ACL as an oral presentation, giving me great confidence in this idea!  This work found the approach quite effective when generating test cases about non-functional requirements and I suspect that this idea would see similar benefits.",
        "Most code generation method generate test cases via human annotation or model synthesis, neither of which can guarantee the comprehensiveness of unit tests. The proposed method, by leveraging property-based testing, offers a possible way to generate sufficient and high-coverage test cases for edge cases. To the best of my knowledge, there have not been any works proposing this method and proven its success. It would greatly affect the field on preparing executable coding examples. ",
        "This paper adapts property-based testing, a useful practice in software engineering, to the LLM code generation domain. The idea of  PBT in Natural Language also has its novelty.",
        "There's a lot of similar work that involves prompting VLMs/LMs in various ways to create new chains of thought. While this method has some slight differences from the others the performance gain would need to be considerable to justify.  Example: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/DDCoT%3A-Duty-Distinct-Chain-of-Thought-Prompting-for-Zheng-Yang/f8b8f926bbfa327c86c40796131fe2695db81126",
        "The statement seems novel, but I feel like it's highly related to multimodal QA like VQA, which is a well studied field.",

While it seems this idea is just a combination of two widely-adopted ideas, I still think it would.be valuable because: (1) most previous works just conducted just proof-of-concept experiments, and I think there is still room for fully exploting the advantage of multi-agent debate (e.g., Akbir's ICML best paper).

        "Let the model explain its confidence in generation is definitely not a novel topic in uncertainty quantification, and numerous researches have demonstrated that, even for simpler scenarios where chain-of-thought is not needed (imagine a very simple classification task), such verbalized uncertainty is not reliable. On the other hands, examining step-by-step reasoning (in chain-of-thought) itself is also not a novel topic especially considering procedural supervision and dense rewards has been a hot topic in human-LLM alignment.

I guess the novelty could lie in the task selection (e.g., applying existing resume studies like the 2004 Bertrand & Mullainathan study), which could provide a more grounded application, but this feels like it lacks some ecological validity -- e.g., is any company really using a language model to write hiring decisions on the basis of name and one phrase about their qualifications alone?

Also, the two-phase generation approach does not make much sense.",

        "I agree with the general premise that \"language models typically focus on avoiding or counterbalancing stereotypes,\" so I think that this adversarial approach provides a more novel take on bias mitigation compared to other prior work. That said, this work feels like one small step away from prior work that has focused on either (i) model \"self-reflection and correction\" on its outputs (e.g., chain-of-thought approach in \"The Capacity for Moral Self-Correction in Large Language Models,\" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07459), or (ii) \"debates\" between an adversarial and base model (e.g., \"DEXPERTS: Decoding-Time Controlled Text Generation with Experts and Anti-Experts,\" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03023; \"Detoxifying Text with MARCO: Controllable Revision with Experts and Anti-Experts,\" https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.21.pdf). There are still some notable differences in this work, namely that it is a more nuanced and complex prompting approach than the \"self-correction\" types of prior work, and is a simpler intervention than some of the \"adversarial v. base model\" prior work -- but at the end of the day, it's still just prompting, which feels a bit like a slight chain-of-thought-like variation of the existing prompt-based approaches that merely instruct models to avoid outputting biased responses (e.g., https://docs.mistral.ai/platform/guardrailing/).",
        "Previous works have studied prompting LLMs to generate counter-stereotypes for mitigating biases (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16173). The propoal does have a slightly different test bed \u2013 using queries that elicit stereotypes and using counter-stereotypes to specifically reformulate stereotypical responses. However, novelty is not clearly in the proposal in the current form and the proposal seems fairly incremental to existing work. ",
        "While there is a fair bit of work dealing with multilingual hallucinations and reasoning in LMs that I was able to find through a cursory search, it seems like the only work that used translation-based approaches were explicitly targeted for the MT task (eg., using multiple pivot languages and marginalizing over them).",

The idea is different from the existing task-decomposition way or multi-agent way, but the effectiveness needs to be verified by the experiments. In addition, the proposed global context is very similar to claude's artifact feature, but since they did not publish any paper, I think this idea is reasonably novel.",

Regardless of the similarity, the motivation and implementation of the idea is still novel and could provide insights to the community. ",

I think avoiding fine-tuning for unlearning is somehow interesting as currently fine-tuning has shown negative impacts to LLMs. Further, the way to compound several LLMs for different roles is novel for this unlearning task. However, based on the description, I felt like the method sounds just like involving a detector to detect whether an input query is related to some key words and then answer with templates 'Sorry I don't know' if it is.

With LLMs often having strong English-centric tokenizers and training data, this is a very natural idea, likely to provide at minimum cost-reduction for other scripts.   However, there are a few very similar papers out there, though they have worked on more limited languages and tasks.  For example, RomanSetu does precisely this, romanizing Hindi for LLM prompting, and find that a) as expected transliteration reduces fertility etc and b) it is necessary to continue training on romanized text for best performance, since this is unlikely to be well-represented in the original data.  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14280v1",

        "The hardest part is data curation, but the evaluation set used in the paper would be a valuable contribution to the literature. The scope of the project needs to be clearly defined so that only a specific kind of \"vernacular\" is being studied, otherwise collecting data will be tough.",
        "I am not sure how hard it is to construct such a graph. But it seems to be a quite straightforward method to implement. The experimental setup and experiments does not seem to be difficulty to manage as well.",
        "No issue with the execution.",
        "This is a highly feasible experiment especially with the existing dataset and the existing  approach already been completed by another paper and so I do think it is  highly feasible and straightforward to implement the idea and run the experiments.",
        "I imagine step (2) in the proposed idea would be a little challenging in execution. Manual efforts would perhaps be involved to generate the 'polarity reversed' world descriptions, or a combination of automation and manual validation would be required to ensure the quality of these descriptions.   Also, the example illustrated in the proposed idea does not come from the datasets mentioned in Step 1. This will likely cause extra planning steps to finalize how the prompting technique would be applied to each of the individual datasets. ",
        "Very easy to implement: requires no model training, datasets are widely available. The prompts seem easy to template as well.",
        "It shouldn't be hard to implement this ideas since it is very straightforward.",
        "The structure is clear and the implementation of the LLM pipeline is not very heavy. One caveat is that in the proposal it mentioned a specialist is needed to manually verify if the identified defect is actually an issue in the SRS document. The domain-specific expertise required can make it less feasible for a typical CS PhD not in the domain.",
        "The approach itself is fairly straightforward. You can draw upon existing synthetic pipeline approaches and even reuse existing codebases towards SRS.",
        "The idea is straightforward to implement. Since they have have abundant OpenAI / Anthropic API access, generating queries on defects with LLMs is not a problem. The only potential difficulty is whether there are enough human resources to label the ground truths. It may be a bit challenging to find people with sufficient expertise on SRS to do the labeling.",
        "The significant feasibility problem for this proposal is it depends too much on the performance of the proposed method, and in the field of uncertainty quantification, due to the black-box nature of model (the usage of GPT-3.5/4 gets this situation even worse), it is hard to say whether we can get an ideal uncertainty measurement that can perform well in the evaluation setup proposed. So there might be many re-routings, and it is hard to tell whether any of them would work. ",
        "Most of the proposal seems straightforward and quick to execute (straightforward prompting and some generally simple analysis). I'm docking feasibility since they mention wanting  to compare to human uncertainty ratings (which, as proposed, seems to be of limited utility, but that's besides the point). Depending on how they'd go about this, involving humans could significantly increase their timeline.",
        "Shouldn't be too hard to implement, according to the step-by-step description. ",
        "I think the chain of prompt is not very hard to implement since it does not touch other softwares. However, one major challenge I see is how to do error analysis or how to figure out which part goes wrong since most CS students don't understand these languages. Also, if we need to use the fallback plan, it would be more challenging. I don't know whether things like bilingual dictionaries or pre-trained cross-lingual embeddings already exist or we even need to create them ourselves.",
        "The idea can be executed within the given constraints with planning. But I think for a typical CS PhD student takes more than 2 months to execute this idea.",
        "Collection of LLM response will take time. Moreover, human evaluation can take time.",
        "The plan is feasible but with some potential difficulties concerns me: 1) Does there have to be a one-to-one correspondence between the adversarial and benign dataset? If so, using existing resources (such as AdvBench) may not be sufficient to generate such dataset with good qualities (extra effort must be spent) 2) Scale of the dataset might need to be very large; unpredictable ",
        "The idea is straightforward. It also provides step-by-step prompts to illustrate the implementation details of the idea. The examples of input-output can also help to further revise the implementation and make it work. One possible problem I anticipate is whether the proposed method can generalize to different tasks and this may require additional work to adapt across different problems.",
        "This is most prompting and can be done by just calling the APIs. The datasets are very accessible and the evaluation is very standard too.",
        "The project is feasible within an academic timeframe with reasonable planning and resource allocation. The steps involved, such as data collection, prompt design, and evaluation, are well-defined and manageable using existing tools like GPT-4 and available datasets like UD treebanks and the African Languages Dataset. However, the development of symbolic rules and their integration with neural parsing may require careful tuning and experimentation.",
        "This work might require heavy prompt engineering works for the proposed modules. For example,  the module to identify key grammatical elements and idiomatic expressions will require quite some engineering efforts. It is also a question whether the LLM is able to generate potential symbolic grammar rules with decent quality. If it's not, then there might need some extra efforts for alternative solutions.",
        "Running the evaluations is pretty straightforward and should be certainly doable in a couple months. The time consuming/challenging part seems to be extracting the relevant (unrelated) analogies for the each bias concept, and further interpreting the results of the model to provide new insights on model behavior. ",
        "Just simple prompt engineering on limited amount of datasets.",
        "This idea is completely feasible. It would require some experience in writing pivot prompts, especially based on the criteria you want to explore and the categories you are working with. I know that the dataset they aim to create focuses on bio and stereotypical social inference, but this approach can also be applied to other datasets. I don't believe you would need to even create multiple pivot prompts. Many of the word prompts could be applicable across multiple datasets, especially if they are as generic as the one proposed, which is primarily focused on humans, hence applying generally to all diversity requirements in humans.",
        "The data collection part should be the most challenging part. Collecting high quality coding problems that involve complex temporal dependencies could be hard. Also the human evaluation might also take time to execute.",
        "It would be pretty hard to collect such datasets (e.g., would mostly require a whole repository), further, it would be difficult to generate executable test cases to verify the multiple problems created. Especially because the task targets temporally-dependent modules in the program, it may necessitate domain experts to carefully construct examples and tests, which would demand a lot of time and costs.",
        "Constructing a reasonable datasets is challenging within a short time. Also human evaluation might take more time. Whether LLM can construct high-quality graph in this case is also to be examined.",
        "feasible as only tracking the intermediate status.",
        "The experiments are fairly easy to implement. They can be broken into separate components around tool use (e.g. compilers), multi-turn reasoning, unit test generation and evaluation, and more.",
        "This seems to be a prompting focused project and therefore shouldn't require more intricate code like model training. I therefore think that one to two months is a very feasible timeline.",
        "First, the infra for supporting code generation experiments is much more complex than normal text-generation tasks. For example, you need to support diverse programming langauge, and may create a sandbox to ensure safe code execution. You also need to support parallel execution, otherwise the evalution step gonna spend quite a long time, especially for certain programming language like Python.  Second, I don't think there is a well-established benchmark for large-scale APIs with documentation.  Third,  implementing the desired symbolic engine feels non-trivial and even somewhat intractable. For example, it's hard to infer the relationship between APIs just based on the documentation.",
        "The document includes a data collection plan and a LLM usage plan, and both are feasible for execution.",
        "This work only requires prompting models and chaining them. The only part that might take time is scraping information from the web for personal information. ",
        "Yes, the idea should be very feasible to run, and benchmark against existing methods. The generated plan is also clear enough to be executed quickly.",
        "I'm going to rate this idea as impossible, especially because it is not easy, or in my opinion, even possible to obtain confidence curves from LLMs. This makes the core basis of this idea impossible to implement. The confidence curve might be considered a function curve where you ask the model to rate its confidence, but previous studies have shown that hallucination and confidence curves do not match up. The model can be confident in its hallucinated response when generating the score, and it is not based on token probabilities. The token probabilities also do not relate to knowledge-based hallucination in general, and the proposal has no way to mitigate that problem. ",
        "Assuming the particular format of the new prompts, methods for merging model responses have been agreed upon in advance, the steps outlined for the experiments seem fairly straightforward, and a PhD student should definitely be able to execute them very quickly and certainly within a 1-2 month timeframe. There are no computational constraints either as there aren't any major bottlenecks like large model training.",
        "Multiple stages involve translating between languages. Although LLMs could do a good job for translating to and from major languages, a good paper will almost certainly need to recruit human annotators to assess the translation qualities. Based on the number of languages involved, it could be moderately to extremely challenging to find these annotators. ",
        "The method includes fine-tuning. It seems to require meticulate evaluation scheme to have good analysis. However, the step-by-step actually has a good plan of where to extract the language-wise information, which is good.",
        "The datasets for low-resource languages, such as Bible translations/OPUS, are already available. Additionally, the baseline prompting methods will be extremely quick to implement and execute. However, a few details are left out, such as the selection method for picking which sentences to include as few-shot examples in the prompt, but this should be relatively quick to figure out an approach.  The biggest issue to feasibility I see is that the project calls for fine-tuning BLOOM (See step 5).  BLOOM has 176B parameters so it's going to take quite a lot of GPUs to fine-tune.  From a systems perspective I see this as causing delays.",
        "The method requries some error-prone programming --- a potentially customed lattice data structure (built from LLM) and prompting LLM with the structure. But over-all, this is not super hard to be achieved.",
        "At least in the proposal, there\u2019s not a lot of detail about what exactly this lattice should look like and how the model can be prompted to reliably create/use the lattice. Even the \u201ctest case examples\u201d section doesn\u2019t include every prompting step of the method (i.e., it\u2019s unclear what the edge prompting and the recursive prompting would look like).  Ironing out these details would likely be non-trivial. Once they start running the experiments, it looks like (even with \u201cabundant\u201d API access) this would take quite a while. They\u2019re considering 3 datasets (unclear how many questions from them), and setting aside the ablations, It looks like they want every lattice to include 15-30 concepts. Even assuming few edges, getting full coverage of asking the LLM about all nodes and edges (and doing the recursive prompting), this balloons the number of API calls per question.   As a minor note, the \u201cproposed method section\u201d makes it sound like the final answer doesn\u2019t come from the LLM directly but by doing some computations on the generated lattice values, but in the \u201ctest case examples\u201d, it sounds like the final uncertainty estimate comes from prompting the LLM again. Maybe this is another axis they plan to vary, But again, this is a sign that significant details need to be ironed out for the project to be feasible.",
        "The challenge will be recruiting appropriate speakers for human evaluation, and illicitation of the data. With careful planning, this should be feasible in 1-2 months, but, could take more time depending on whether the researchers already have contacts or how familiar the researchers are with creating instructions for human annotators / elicitation -- otherwise, it may take time to do a pilot, adjust, and continue. ",
        "The key is the availability/quality of the dataset and its evaluation. This could take long time.",
        "I think making the evaluation sets is unfeasible in the amount of time suggested. You need speakers of the low-resource languages in questions and you need human evaluation of the annotated data, which is going to be tough if you want to pick an actual low-resource language. Also not sure how to make the eval sets strongly reliant on phonetic cues. Overall, it seems to require a lot of setup even before you do the experiments.",
        "The bottleneck seems to be the dataset collection process if there are not existing datasets that fit the requirements of the paper. Second, the project is feasible only if the proposed PCoT method works. The fallback plan (Part 6) seems to be more time consuming. ",
        "The datasets are ready and the prompting pipeline should be fairly easy to implement.",
        "It may require some prompt engineering, and implementation of the multi-step workflow. If the project goes to the fallback plan, the analysis could be a challenge.",
        "Code generation work can be somewhat resource and cost intensive to validate all the generated code, as well as working with frontier models such as GPT-4, Claude, etc.  However HumanEval and similar tasks will be relatively less lift than other code generation benchmarks like SWE-bench.  I think that implementing this prompting approach for code generation should be relatively straightforward and most of the challenges will lie in the implementation of the code validation pipeline.",
        "The implementation is straight-forward, because the concept of PBT is already well-established in the software engineering field. Generating PBT in both code and NL format mostly just involve prompting LLMs and could be implemented fairly easily. ",
        "This is a inference time technique, which doesn't rely on training model. Besides, it doesn't even require a ton of API calls.",
        "I believe the experimental part of executing this project (as with all prompting papers) would be fairly straightforward. I am concerned that the data collection and evaluation parts to a point that is defensible will be challenging though---how do you define a discrete fact here? Which topics are appropriate to search for multimodal support? There is a lack of specificity in how those will be resolved.",
        "The idea is starightforward.",
        "The methodological part is not hard. The choice of the data can be hard (clinical data is a good starting point though). The annotation of human preferences can be hard to get if high inter-annotator agreement is ensured.",
        "The proposal is too vague and does not clearly describe how the idea would be executed. The key novelty of the proposal lies in learning user preferences of uncertainty expression through interaction, however, the proposal does not clearly detail how this would be achieved. Furthermore, the approach mentions simulating human-AI interactions to evaluate uncertainty expression methods, but it not clear how these interactions be indicative of appropriate reliance for the model to adapt the uncertainty expression to phrasing that leads to appropriate reliance. Lastly, the proposal lists uncertainty expression in high-stakes scenarios, however it is not clear how the model would practically adapt to user preference in a high-stakes scenario without a potentially critical trial-and-error first. Thus, even from the use-case perspective, the approach is very hand-wavy. As is, the proposal is too vague to be feasible. ",
        "The method is described clearly and quite straightforward to implement. There is little concern regarding compute resources. The method uses some tool creation technique but this is quite vague in the proposal and needs elaboration. A minor issue is that text-davinci-003 is mentioned in the experiment plan, but this model is deprecated.",
        "The idea seems highly feasible as it is largely a 3-step prompting technique where each step is well defined and feasible. The first step is to identify the optimal algorithm for solving the coding problem, which I believe LLM is already capable of doing. The second and third step are also straightforward and seem very doable. ",
        "The project is feasible within a typical academic timeframe with reasonable planning. The main components, such as dataset preparation, prompt design, and evaluation, are well-defined and manageable using available APIs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. However, it will require careful planning and efficient use of resources, especially given the limited GPU compute.",
        "I think this idea could be feasibly executed by a PhD student in 1-2 months. It would depend on how long the evaluation portion would take to rate naturalness and authenticity with native speakers.",
        "With 2 models and 2 datasets, this project seems quite feasible in 1-2 months.",
        "The execution of prompting should be straightforward. The question is, how does one evaluate? If all metrics are automatically measured, is the evaluation representing the real human emotions? If human evaluation will be required, this can pose some challenges.",
        "Implementing a baseline version of this approach sounds pretty straightforward (mostly just prompting). Tuning the prompt for the supervisor agent might be tricky, though: it seems like the success of the method hinges on how well the supervisor agent can generate the most appropriate response, and the current suggested prompt might not be the most effective way of doing that.",
        "I choose 5 instead of 6 because (1) there are some correctness issues or places in which the idea is underspecified which would require more thought and planning, and (2) the study suggests conducting a human study, which would take time.   On correctness/underspecification: * How to construct a consistency score that evaluates the logical consistency of responses along each branch? * Brier score: in this setting, we'd need to use a multi-class Brier score. But in the open-ended QA setting, it's not clear how to define this... what are the classes over which you want to obtain a probabilistic forecast?  Overall though, the idea should be pretty straightforward to execute.",
        "The proposed plan involves collecting human judgments which means that this will require some careful planning. Moreover, the scoring mechanism to weigh the plausibility of each branch does not seem trivial and may also take careful planning; however it seems doable!",
        "The pipeline is feasible to me. The major challenge would be finding similarity threshold for each dataset.",
        "Simple prompting approach that is easy to implement. Evaluation is simple. ",
        "The proposed approach should be straightforward to implement: it only requires prompt engineering to extract semantic concepts and evaluate the relevance of a candidate next step. ",
        "The target task is clearly proposed. Implementing the ieas are not hard. The method to evaluate the elevance, conciseness, and factual consistency of the generated text can be tricky. Yet the authors can try multiple different automatic or semi-automatic methods and compare them with human annotations.",
        "summarizing long document and rating each paragraph with scores will require a lot of input/output tokens. Will cost a lot when using API, or require a strong GPU power to calculate it with an open-sourced model. ",
        "I think the prompt design and experimental setting is not hard for AI. All the debate related information can be found online as PDF. I think the difficult part is when there is no performance improvement, how to improve the overall pipeline with new ideas.",

        "I think the part (3) Debate and (4) Third-Party Judgement is difficult to execute. I vaguely remember that the conclusion of existing papers is that LLMs tend to forget its original stance after multiple rounds of (3) debates, and that since the (4) 3rd party judgement is also an LLM, I am not sure how accurate the overall performance can be.   Also, the executive plan is very brief about how to conduct (3) and (4).",
        "Much of the execution seems feasible: the proposal lists out known datasets and metrics that can be adapted to the task. My big concern about feasibility is how the authors will select historical periods and topics. I can imagine that depending on what historical period is selected, the trend analysis will be quite different. For example, the status of women in the workplace in the 1920s is extremely different from women in the 1950s or the 1990s. I would be curious how the proposal creators suggest identifying these time periods in a systematic way.",
        "I don't foresee many challenges in running API calls because the scale seems manageable (assuming a decent amount of budget like 200 dollars is accessible). My minor concern is that the experiments need to consider whether it's more effective to prompt the model in multiple turns within a single session or combine all prompts/instructions to get a single response from the model. This step may need some planning and prompt tuning.",

        "The project is feasible within a typical academic timeframe with reasonable planning. The main components, such as dataset preparation, prompt design, and evaluation, are well-defined and manageable using available APIs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. However, it will require careful planning and efficient use of resources, especially given the limited GPU compute.",

I think one of the points that would be an  issue is how these non real or fake statements are tested but I feel like  the proposed methods relies on the idea that the model knows what it can be  non-factual and considering that it is similar to multi-language learning where  you have a cache of database of possible non-factual statements I think this  should be pretty easy to implement even on a large scale.",

Given most of our math datasets use simple arithmetics knowledge, I doubt that this kind of \"polishing strategies\" method would make a difference, as the LLMs probably can't even propose a describable strategy (since they are too easy and obvious). There are also other things I'm not happy about: (1) Why is it \"recursive\"? the text didn't reflect that. (2) The proposed method mentioned that all the strategies will be \"saved\", but for what? Doesn't each testing instance use different strategies?",

        "The project is not overly compute intensive; however, I gave a low score on feasibility because it seems like several key details from the proposal are missing. For example, the proposal only provides in very broad details how a researcher might go about bias correction. Furthermore, for analyzing the effectiveness of the method, the proposal only provides a very ad-hoc + hand-wavey suggestion to compare responses across predefined questions. This leaves me wondering how the questions will be selected to ensure they have some degree of meaningful bias across languages and how the bias reduction will be evaluated. ",
        "The ideas are still at a high-level and can be operated in different ways. There can be a lot of explorations for a student to do so it is hard to predict whether 1-2 months are feasible. ",

But then, how we use the retrieved text for each sub-claims to give the final output is not clear.  \"This approach ultimately yields a reasoning graph (or tree) that logically and deductively explains how a legal conclusion is reached.\" is far from executable. In a 1000 foot view I can probably imagine how the reasoning graph can be used to obtain better output, but more details is needed.",

The implement should be fairly easy, cause it only involves solution generation and refinement/execution feedback generation, both can be easily realized with existing frameworks and some prompt engineering. However, the selected APIs (flask, pandas, opengl) may require certain technical skills to set up the environment and run experiments smoothly.",

        "The method is only prompting technique. Therefore, it could be feasible to implement.",
        "It should be rather feasible to implement the core verifiers as they are simply a set of (potentially few-shot) prompts.    However, there are some uncertainties in the proposal that may take a long time to explore and form a well-defined framework. For example, the authors proposed to 1) finetune a BERT for factuality evaluation, and 2) \"[develop] a metric to measure internal consistency of the generated text, possibly using a separate LLM to rate consistency.\" It is not clear to me how those can be done in a rather short period of time.   In addition, the method proposed in the proposal requires a repeating generation process. To be specific, after generation of every token, the proposed pipeline will conduct a verification step. This means in step n the LLM takes a prompt of length n-1. This results in O(n^2) input tokens to the LLM API in the whole generation process of length n. ",
        "The idea has a clear plan on how to implement this idea with simple prompt engineering on existing dataset.",
        "The low score in this category is primarily due to word-level and sentence-level verification. I am uncertain about the value of word-level verification in this context, and sentence-level verification seems too granular. For the model to verify itself regarding hallucinations, it also needs to generate an explanation. Given the costs associated with input and output tokens required for this study, I believe it is beyond the resources of any academic lab that might conduct it. Additionally, the current structure does not account for prompt caching or the benefits of using the same context repeatedly, which leads to excessive spending and makes it economically unfeasible in terms of API costs. While the idea is technically feasible, it requires a significant financial investment to implement. ",
        "The project proposed a new prompting strategy, which might only require building a pipeline of data preprocessing, data loading, prompt template filling, api call (most time-consuming step), and finally gather the results and analysis. Easy to implement",
        "The pipeline is simple and straightforward. Datasets are publicly available. No training or complicated coding is involved in the execution of the idea.",
        "Implementing this idea is feasible in 2 months. Though due to the high usuage of GPT4 it's gonna be pretty expensive. ",
        "The key step of the proposed method is how to design the relevance scoring algorithm -- there is not even a baseline implementation proposed, and the illustrated test example only show the execution up to step-3. This scoring algorithm can be very important, as it will decide whether the \"final calibrated context\" will reconcile useful information from the proposed QA, or just absorb more noise. Therefore, it could be hard for students to implement even a baseline. ",
        "The pipelines does not seem very complicated to implement, given most of parts is prompting. The most challenging part could be implementing the scoring mechanism, but it should be manageable in my opinion.",
        "The idea is well-described and does not rely on retreival / training data. This should make the system entirely prompt-based, and the student only needs to manage the agent flow.",
        "The evaluation involves annotations by mathematicians, who are highly expert annotators. Creating the annotation logistics and recruiting for annotators will bring the most amount of work.",
        "Finding scenarios that can be composed together into an adversarial attack could be difficult since models are ever-changing and are already behind safety filters. Further, exploring different subtask compositions might become expensive.",

        "The project infrastructure seems more difficult than simply choosing some prompting methods.  It would be an iterative process choosing real example applications from Github, and developing the few shot prompts manually to get a feel for this task.  Then, some of the modules seem like 1-2 week tasks (Execution Module, Exploration, Storage) which I estimate would make the project more like 3 - 4 months to complete all modules AND to do the evaluations.",
        "As mathematical reasoning is still challenging for most of LLMs, it requires a lot of engineering efforts on trial, improvement, and iteration to design the ToT prompting pipeline. Furthermore, as the tree search process is bottlenecked by LLM inference, it may consume a lot of time and computational resources to refine the pipeline and conduct further analysis.",
        "Approach is highly feasible, primarily prompting models for both their proposed approach and baselines that are suggested. Might need ",

In step Inverse Diffraction, how do we design the decoder, i.e., what are inputs and outputs for it? I also felt this model will be hard to train.",

        "The experiment plan is quite reasonable. While based on my previous experiments, running multi-agent debate on program generation may require quite complex scaffolding/prompting engineering to induce reasonably well performance from modern LMs. Otherwise, modern LMs (even GPT-4) might just cannot debate.",
        "The experiment plan is very detailed. The experiments are mainly API-based, so does not raise concerns in terms of computation resources. I think collecting the dataset and having expert evaluation on paradigm-specific best practices will be the biggest challenges. The plan is in general feasible to work on.",

        "Overall the executive plan looks pretty feasible to me. Many components are prompting-based which is straightforward to implement. However, the execution plan is missing an important part: how to generated the quotes or citations, but prior works have demonstrated a way, so I gave a score of 6. ",
        "It is kind of feasible to implement this paper but I wouldn't say really  especially because it is hard to find sources in Wikipedia where you would  actually be doing citations even if you have a query dataset that you would be  looking for. It is also unclear whether you would score them as -1, 0, 1 based on  whether something is included or something is completely absent or  something is against and it is an open research problem to even figure out if  something is in favor or against or completely neutral in terms of NLI in  this case here and so what I think this idea is in general interesting I think  the technical details are lost over completely here.",

        "The entire pipeline only involves language model prompting and program interpreter based execution, both of which should be easily to implement, and chaining them together wouldn't use a lot of work. It may take a while to collect high-quality data using complex APIs.",
        "The implementation is definitely (much) more involved than pure prompting methods and probably requires a decent understanding of Fisher information and an efficent imementation of Hessian computation. However, I think it is still executable within a reasonable amount of time as it an inference-time technique. ",
        "1-2 months may be too short for this idea, but if the experiments is conducted on smaller LMs like OPT then it should be doable.",
        "The proposed method is quite feasible. The majority of design choices made in the proposal are rather lightweight Engineering-wise. The only caveat I'm seeing is in the Focal-Contrast Branching step, where the authors assume access to next-token probability distributions, which might not be available for some of the close source LLMs. That being said I think most of the LLMs provide at least the top k token probabilities which might still be useful. ",
        "This project is mostly prompting work. It is feasible to be executed with abundant API resources.",
        "The idea is clear and simple. The simplest implementation of the method would not be hard (just ask the model to check everything). There are also some clear variants: e.g., if you aggregate all the constraints or verfiy the constraints separately. I think this method can also be used to sample from the top-X generated candidates.",
        "It seems highly feasible to setup the idea. The domains such as systems of equations and suggested are reasonable benchmarks (though some filtering needs to be done which could be automated by GPT4/Gemini/Claude). The All Ireland Linguistics Olympiad problems may need some setup given that the problems need to be curated into a dataset, but the other domains are existing datasets that only need some minor postprocessing to work with.",
        "Not much to justify. Just run the prompt on all the mentioned dataset. No GPU cost needed. API cost is probably 10x the standard-prompt evaluation cost, still manageable. ",
        "This is very feasible. It is not difficult to execute at all. I also feel like the experiment should also be what is the recall/precision of the model self-estimated confidence in the task domain. And maybe also need to evaluate how good is the problem break down. There are a lot of moving parts, it would be better to propose to evaluate them separately first.",
        "The plan already mentions a dataset which could be used so there is already a starting point for running the experiments, which will be quick since they're just prompting. To go beyond the plan, I'm sure more datasets exist and can be used rather than having to collect new ones from human annotators.",

But I'm also wondering how would the performance comparison between MASC method and \"training/prompting a LLM with full data of diverse expertise\"?   From my understanding, the latter one might be more potential as the LLMs might learn some intersectional representations of data points when putting all these data together to improve LLMs.",

There are some components left for the researcher to explore, like \"Use existing datasets such as TimeQA and HistoryQA, and augment them with additional questions that specifically test for temporal consistency and factual accuracy across different eras.\". Besides small aspects like this one, I find the idea to be overall feasible. ",

If so, using existing resources (such as AdvBench) may not be sufficient to generate such dataset with good qualities (extra effort must be spent) 2) Scale of the dataset might need to be very large; unpredictable ",

Contrary to the proposal\u2019s emphasis on prompting, training the model appears to be the core of this research idea. Training a vision-language model to perform multi-step, multi-image reasoning for coding problems isn't trivial. Achieving this within 1-2 months in an academic lab will be challenging. Again, there seem to be some technical flaws in the research idea. It\u2019s unclear how CLIP is connected to the language model and how training a CLIP model would enable the LM to understand images. Maybe the author wants to use a llava-style fine-tuning method by integrating the LM and CLIP together.",

But in general, I believe the proposed idea could be easily implemented.",
        "I think the reference obtaining procedure requires some careful design. For example, one needs to narrow down the scope the potential references. One also need to verify that current models are capable of outputing high-quality references. Other steps are pretty conventional and can be implemented easily.",
        "It does not require much effort.",
        "Considering Anthropic recently released multi-shot jailbreaking paper, the proposal comes out at an unfortunate time that a major part of it seems marginal contributions compared to Anthropic's paper. As I explained above, it is not hard to expect the proposed Anti-CWD attack will be able to circumvent CWD, so this makes the proposed plan a bit feasible. However, CWD itself is a relatively weak defense method (Anthropic tried RL and fine-tuning. Even in the pure-prompting method, it seems ICD works better than CWD) so the success here is just a small guaranteed part of the full success of the proposal. ",

        "The plan given in the question are sufficiently detailed. No GPU is required. So mainly API-level coding. Benchmarks exists. So clearly actionable.",
        "Should be fairly simple to run. However, calculating correctness on TruthfulQA, which involves long open-ended questions, is not that easy. You may need to write an additional prompt for auto-eval with GPT-4, which can introduce some complexities.",
        "It is just prompting, so it should be easy for PhD student",
        "Generating the supporting and opposing arguments is not hard for current models. Presenting extra can help model calibration in recent work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17124). This idea is totally viable to implement.",
        "1. While using counterfactual code edits to evaluate LLM-based code evaluators is reasonable, I think it gonna be challenging to do controllable counterfactual generation (i.e., controllably editing the code to be correct or incorrect), especially when we want to use highly complex repositories as the testbed.  2. Also I've conducted experiments of using LMs to evaluate program correctness. And it turns out that even GPT-4 can not perform reasonably well in evaluating its own generated programs when the problem is quite complex. So generally, building evaluators for complex program would be quite challenging.",
        "some steps i actually didn't quite get what the author wanna do.",
        "It should be fairly straight forward to build the prompting pipeline. One potential challenge is the data collection part, where we need to make sure the problem is related to the dimensional errors.",
        "The approach and baselines seems highly feasible to setup. The reason I have slightly reduced the score here is that the datasets mentioned don't seem to exist (at least from an initial google search). Thus more work might need to be done to choose an effective dataset for this problem.",
        "I rated this idea a 7 because it is feasible within the given constraints with reasonable planning and use of APIs. The project involves manageable tasks such as training adapter modules, designing prompts, and dataset preparation, all of which can be executed with available computational resources. The primary challenges, like prompt tuning and evaluation, are standard in NLP research and can be handled within the 1-2 month timeframe.",
        "The data exists.  This project mainly entails plugging in these datasets to a prompt template and finetuning for a bit.  There is little left unspecified, and it should be quite simple to execute on.",
        "The only part of the project that seems challenging is obtaining correctness annotations for one of the datasets (e.g., Essay Writing). GSM8K and code datasets like HumanEval seem like very natural long-form output settings to try out the idea.  Other than this, iterating on the prompts for decomposition / verbalized UQ for each of the modules will be important, but the author mentions this.",
        "The idea seems simple enough to implement with API access, considering all the steps involved in the method can be done via prompting with API. The proposal does mention using LLaMA3-70B as an additional model, which would require GPUs I guess.",
        "    - The proposed idea is fairly executable. It involves         - collecting standard malicious requests (readily available, e.g., https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks/blob/main/data/advbench/harmful_behaviors.csv)          - writing prompts & templates for each of the steps, which a frontier LLM can potentially do well     - The idea does however involve pre-defining malicious tasks and structure to the metadata (to describe the input prompt); some manual effort may be needed.",
        "The idea sounds relatively easy to implement as only some prompt engineer techniques are required",
        "I rated this idea a 5 because the method involves multiple levels of information (word, sentence, and culture) and requires training an adapter, which can be computationally intensive. Additionally, obtaining and processing cultural datasets may need careful attention. While it is feasible, it would require some modifications and advanced computational strategies to fit the constraints and ensure successful execution within 1-2 months.",
        "The proposed method focuses on multilingual embeddings, but the models selected are LLMs such as LLaMA and GPT, which do not take embeddings as input. Additionally, the \"adapter\" in step 3 is not pre-specified. Many details of the method is missing.",
        "The data collection part should be the most challenging part. Collecting high quality coding problems that involve complex temporal dependencies could be hard. Also the human evaluation might also take time to execute.",
        "It would be pretty hard to collect such datasets (e.g., would mostly require a whole repository), further, it would be difficult to generate executable test cases to verify the multiple problems created. Especially because the task targets temporally-dependent modules in the program, it may necessitate domain experts to carefully construct examples and tests, which would demand a lot of time and costs.",
        "Constructing a reasonable datasets is challenging within a short time. Also human evaluation might take more time. Whether LLM can construct high-quality graph in this case is also to be examined.",
        "No problem. It's easy to implement. But I'm not sure how the author checked its references (citations), if all the references should be checked by humans. This experiment might be hard to scale.",
        "It is definitely feasible to try since this project only needs API access to LLMs."

        "I just don't think frontier LLMs have any trouble with the kind of modern language shown in the examples. Furthermore, we can't reliably predict semantic change so I don't think this will even work if e.g. you use a 2020-trained LM on language from 2040. The only solution would be some kind of RAG, expert prompting, or continued pretraining. Making the model guess what semantic change has happened is just not going to work.",
        "I don't feel this will work well compared to just include the explanations of the phrases in prompts.",
        "A lot of previous work have approached this problem in a very similar way, so it would have similar performance. Additionally, if a model hallucinates on the CoT step, evaluating each CoT might also hallucinate, which is harmful to entire pipeline",
        "The idea should somewhat work because as it has been shown in the previous paper  the idea does somewhat work but it suffers from the same issue as do things like  multiple looping structures where if we can't verify whether the first three  strings that are generated make sense or not then the chain of thought wouldn't necessarily make sense because it is all interlinked in a loop like  structure even if it has three loops that are running concurrently with each other.",
        "The example shown in the proposed idea already has a strong baseline that does not show explicit gender stereotype. In contrast, the proposed method could offer counter-factual explanations or arguments because of the \"stereotype inversion.\" This makes me feel the proposed idea does not address the fairness problem in LLMs better than existing safety guardrails. ",
        "I would expect this to work reasonably well since a variety of prompt-based approaches have been shown to work well on this sort of task. However, I'm skeptical that this prompt-based approach would significantly outperform existing prompt-based approaches.",
        "This idea does not make sense to me at all. Why would reversing the stereotype could help to reduce the bias? It simply creates another kinds of bias.",
        "I think by breaking down a long document into sections, and focusing on each of the independent sections separately, the method will highly likely decrease the difficulty for LLMs to understand the texts (as there are less concepts, relationship, etc). And it can be expected to see a positive improvement on the tasks.   That being said, recently released LLMs have very long context lengths. For example Claude-3.5-sonnet has 200K context lengths (https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet). I wonder how big the difference will be if we just input the whole document, generate the defect questions, and verify them. ",
        "The idea itself is fairly likely to succeed. The application space is constrained towards SRS and each of the sections within the document. Therefore, the LM can likely handle documents and specifics of the domain through in-context learning or fine-tuning.",
        "Converting SRS Document defects detection prompts into yes/no questions on sections of the document does not fundamentally change the way of applying LLMs on this problem. It is too simple and does not have any specific designs such as planning or states tracking or finetuning to enhance LLMs ability. Constructing the questions by sections is also unlikely to work better than existing conventional approaches like RAG. Overall, this idea is unlikely to work well, even in the specific scenarios of SRS Document defects detection.",
        "The big issue for the effectiveness of the proposed method is that, it asserts very strong assumptions on downstream tasks, such as there must exist only two extremes, or at least two extremes are complicated enough for quantifying uncertainty. This is definitely not true. Think about multi-choice QA, emotion detection, etc. In these tasks, there are far more than two extremes, and even a spectrum of extremes. We also do not know how the model understand the task -- so it might be unfair for the model uncertainty quantification by using human priors that there are only two extremes. Also, this proposal assumes that the model can place its own output under two extremes well -- it is hard to say, as it may not even understand what it generates (\"Generative AI paradox\"). ",
        "I could be misunderstanding, but I have a hard time imagining this would work well. It seems like the poles will only be useful if they\u2019re actually relevant to the question and if they encourage the model to use a piece of information that it actually \"knows\" and isn\u2019t already relying on. In their Paris example, being a \u201cmajor global city\u201d may be a good sign that a city is a capital, but would a model that doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d that Paris is a capital \u201cknow\u201d that it is a major city? I\u2019d be concerned that the model\u2019s ability to pick a good axis and to put their answer on the axis would correlate with the model\u2019s ability to \u201cunderstand\u201d  the scenario and quantify its uncertainty in the baseline setting. It also seems like multiple axes/poles would be necessary to really get a good sense of the answer. London is also a \u201cmajor global city\u201d but clearly not the capital of France.",
        "I don't think this idea would result in major improvement. There are too many vague and ill defined tasks (e.g., asking the LLM to identify the key abstract concepts). Also, the authors might expect the LLM to do more than it's capable of doing, such as creating a network of related concepts and their relationships for low-resource languages. The problem is that most LLMs will probably fail there because they didn't have enough training data in these low-resource languages.  ",
        "I think the proposed method is reasonable. My concern is that \"Semantic Network Construction\" is implemented as a single prompt in the proposal - I don't know whether this is oversimplified. I think generating a graph or a network is pretty hard and also defining the network so it can be useful is non-trivial. I cannot judge the provided example because I don't understand the language.",
        "I think this idea going to be somewhat effective. But the effectiveness og this approach is going to depend on the resources available in the target language and the model fails in \"Cross-Lingual Mapping\" the idea is not goint to work properly. ",
        "The injection mechanism worked well in vision domain. So, when applied carefully in NLP can work as well.",
        "Given the similarity of the idea with existing works and the models used in the pipeline, there is a decent chance that it could work marginally better but not guaranteed ",
        "One potential problem is the error accumulation as conceptual scaffolding prompting would elicit substantially longer reasoning chains, causing a significant growth of the search space and increase of uncertainty. Also, for some relatively easy problems in datasets such as GSM8K, I doubt whether it is really necessary to utilize concepts to conduct reasoning. Probably this reasoning framework can be redundant and even cause errors that wouldn't occur in standard or CoT prompting.",
        "First, none of the chosen datasets (MATH, GSM8K, and MMLU) uses complicated math concepts -- if you read some examples from the datasets, they are either simple arithmetic tasks or they use one or two simple math concepts like combination or probabilities. A lot of the concepts the problem will use are also extremely basic and simple (the example provided by the proposal is evidence -- even for current day LLMs, \"rectangle properties\" is too basic). I doubt that this will improve the performance and I even suspect the complicated prompting scheme will hurt performance.",
        "The proposed method has a good chance of outperforming existing baselines due to its combined approach of using both neural networks and symbolic rules. This dual approach can potentially handle the unique grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions found in low-resource languages better than purely neural or symbolic methods alone.",
        "The proposed idea heavily reply on LLM's capabilities on identifying key grammatical elements and idiomatic expressions, as well as, generating symbolic grammar rules. It's still a question whether existing LLMs are strong enough for these, especailly for low-resource language. ",
        "I'm unsure about how it would do compared to the baselines on metrics such as accuracy. However, I think the experiment has a lot of potential in unlocking new insights about the ways in which biases manifest in language models. So, while not a direct answer to the particular question above, I think it can be very effective/useful overall as an experiment.",
        "Persona-inducing can somehow increase the diversity of LLMs' generated output so intuitively it may be effective in bias mitigation.",
        "I believe the original idea could be quite effective. However, I would rate it a 6 instead of an 8 because it overlooks many general concerns that people have regarding this type of prompting. This issue is reminiscent of what occurred with Google's image generation: how do you define the boundaries of what is absolutely not possible? For instance, if you have a similar dataset that originated in the 1800s, there were only a few professions that women could legally or even illegally pursue. How do you define which professions existed at that time, what the scope of possibilities is, and how do you ensure diversity in real-world scenarios under these conditions? I think the proposal bypasses this crucial issue in any unbiased generation. ",
        "With specific prompting techniques, the proposed method should outperform baselines in term of temporal dependencies",
        "I am not very confident that the model can solve this complex temporally-depending programming problems with a reasonable correctness. Furthermore, because the current method is basically prompting, which may have a very low performance upper-bound. Therefore, I don't expect the proposed method to improve significantly on code generation.",
        "One needs to build reasonable metric to show effectiveness. Also, one might need to tune prompts carefully to construct high-quality graph in this case.",
        "intuitively thinking this should works.",
        "Most code approaches right now also use multi-turn approaches and unit tests. However, not many of them integrate tool use and, when they do, it isn't that good. By make it iterative and allowing the models to \"hill climb\" through the use of a continuous state, it could significantly improve performance.",
        "Based on the related paper I cited above, I wouldn't be surprised if this method improved performance on several benchmarks. However, I'd expect other methods, like actually executing the code instead of having the LLM simulate the execution, might work much better.",
        "Getting feedback from compilerfrom compiler could be a strong baseline, since symbolic checks are involved by the compiler. But conducting symoblic checks during code generation should effectively improve the one-shot success rate.",

In such a scenario, you would essentially be running a multi-agent ensemble of networks. The idea is that the confidence and output of large language models (LLMs) among different models would ensure and correct the behavior of their peers. However, given the current state of models, the available parameters, and the techniques we have now, I believe this is not feasible to implement. I think this approach will not be effective in general. ",

The evaluation methodology hasn't been specified the proposal (it merely states \"Compare whether the new answer provides a more well-rounded response that considers different cultural backgrounds\"). Prior work has shown mixed results on multilinguality as a debiasing method  (some results even showing that multilingual fine tuning for instance can exacerbate bias). Thus, is unclear how well this method will perform. Further, it is unclear how much better this would be compared to just explicitly prompting the model to consider different cultures etc. perhaps in a CoT fashion.",

I would instead prefer a more localized answer that directly let me know the most relevant answers. If the point is that, given a question in a certain language, models should not assume the cultural setting mainly associated with that language, then the proposal needs to explain why it is harmful or unacceptable to have such implicit assumption in the models.  In addition, even if the goal of generating comprehensive answers that cover many cultures is well justified, the proposed method relies on the model's ability to answer multilingual questions with approximately same good performance. However, this is likely not the case because there might still be gaps between model's performance in English and in another low-resource language. If the model cannot answer cultural questions in a less spoken language, it will likely fall back to what it knows in another major language. This can significantly limit the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The proposal includes a plan to compare against a completely random baseline.  I would suggest a \"Random Search\" baseline as well.  In such a baseline you would take the training set of low-resource translations and use it as a validation set.  Then you would propose random combinations of translations as fewshot examples and put the combination which scores highest in context.  You may be able to use the typological vectors to steer this search process.  In my experimentation random search prompting far exceeds other methods.  Since LLMs are somewhat black boxes it can be a surprising combination of prompts which works the best.  I see no major flaws in the method and I suspect it to also work well, but I think this \"Random Search\" baseline has significant chance to achieve high performance as well.",

Also, I think this method's level of \"effectiveness\" would be greatly affected by whether you factor in the number of API calls needed to arrive at an answer.

Finally, I don't think the phonetic component is the main issue in performance, I think knowledge of the language is the problem.

This brings the question of whether this similarity threshold is non-trivial at all for some tasks. ",

Another important assumption in this approach is that things only get \"better\" as time passes. This may not be true as our society evolves.

Furthermore, it is not clear if model confidence or explanations for the adversarial queries would be reasonably calibrated themselves to be really useful in calibrating the final model confidence.

        "LLMs can not effectively distinguish if their generated output is confident enough and can not verify if their outputs are hallucination.",
        "I believe this idea could be somewhat effective. There have been previous studies examining whether you can ask the same model for verification regarding whether something is hallucinatory or not. The concept here is similar: you are asking the model to fact-check before generation, rather than after generation, which is both beneficial and novel, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm unsure how much information is provided word by word. The example given here focuses on an important fact, but I don't think there are many words that would require hallucination verification before generation. ",
        "Since this project is very similar to the CoT+Unit test generation paradigm, I would expect it performs similar to existing baselines. ",
        "Given the results of other similar studies facilitating code generation with explanation and extra test cases, it is very likely that the proposed idea can beat the baseline.",
        "I believe using promting in this scenario and for this problem might marginally improve the results compare to the standard baseline, but most likely LLMs will hallucinate the reason and semantic explanation and prompting won't effectively improve their reasoning.",
        "Considering the findings in the relevant fields (in LM safety, faithfulness and self-reflection), it is clear that LLM-proposed context changes (as additional QA pairs in this proposal) can be misleading, off-topic and may self-enhance the inherent bias. So we should not put too much faith in getting desired results that easily. ",
        "The approach is probably effective. But I suspect that there might need to have some trained classifier in the pipeline to work effectively instead of relying solely on prompting.",
        "The idea makes sense and is probably what an expert would do. There are 2 ways I can see how the system could be improved: (1) the ability to backtrack: the idea, as described, does not seem to allow ways to backtrack once the agent identifies there is an error of some sort.   However, it is to be investigated whether this is necessary (i.e., it is quite possible the current system as described could beat baselines); (2) the use of confidence score: personally I am not too in favor of using confidence estimation for these reasoning tasks. But this depends on empirical results.",
        "Iteratively improving the proof should lead to better results. In the meantime, it may incur fundamental errors that are caused by proof sketch.",
        "True diversity of attacks might not be possible since that would require LLMs to generate an attack never seen before and they are only trained on data that has been collected and is seen. However, composing sub-scenarios into potentially harmful outcomes is likely to yield some interesting attacks. Evaluating the diversity of natural language attacks is also challenging.",
        "Intuitively, such technique would work somewhat ineffective on un-aligned LLMs and somewhat effective on aligned LLM due to the training distribution. It is less likely that bootstrapping LLM's generation would lead to prevention of undetected adversarial attacks.",

        "The baseline here is a zero-shot prompt, asking to do the NL intent and feeding in all the documentation of the API.  Assuming the author is correct to say that such NL function mapping requires good few & diverse few-shot examples, I expect the method to work well.  It uses a number of external systems to enrich the code dataset to give the LLM context, and uses system errors to inform. So in some ways, Autoprompting is allowing an agent to make use of all these SWE tools for understand the software, which then will allow it to maximize its understand and better retrieve good few-shot examples for the task at hand.",
        "The idea is straightforward and there are already a lot of related code repos for reference. However, I found the baseline chosen here not a fair comparison to the proposed idea. Specifically, ToT prompting can cause substantial increase in the computational cost, making the baselines such as CoT prompting not comparable. Therefore, if we choose a baseline of the same computation budget (e.g., instance-level sampling + analytical navigation & iterative refinement), it is hard to tell whether the proposed method would still make a significant improvement against the baseline methods.",
        "The tree of thought paper compares against these baselines in their work and find it to be more effective. Additionally, the strength of the base models considered (e.g GPT4/LLama) leads me to believe that their pass@k for a certain problem should be high, leading to ToT being an effective approach to find the succesfful solutions.",
        "While the method is unique, it is unclear how effective it would be since creating embeddings for concepts is not trivial. This could require multiple iterations to get right and forms the basis for the proposed approach (along with the weighted sum calculation).",

        "Considering that previous works suggest that LLM's self confidence estimation is generally indicative, if a resonable way (like using external knowledge) can be used to improve the low-confidence results. There is a decent chance that the performance can be improved. Otherwise only relying on the models' self-improvment I think the improvement could be marginal (compared to existing self-reflective methods).",

        "I think that the success of this project depends on the innate capabilities of current frontier LLMs. It is possible for them to quantify the confidence in their answers properly (i.e. if they are well calibrated), then I think this pipeline might be quite effective.

Moreover, generating unit tests is indeed a challenging task, even for humans. I've tried to use LMs generate unit tests, while they can generate some easy/toy unit tests, they usually fail when it comes to more complex unit tests.",

Instead, you're using pre-trained data and verifying it with external sources, which could introduce latency and not always correlate with entailment issues. Searching through a large corpus of citations, even with tools like Quip's measure, might exclude information not present in Wikipedia or other datasets. A narrower scope, such as using a PubMed dataset focused on biological questions, would likely yield better results than the current broader approach, which has challenges in matching and validating answers.",

        "Based on the current method, it seems to play similarly as using input-output examples provided by APIs to assist code generation, so I do not expect a huge improvement of the proposed method. Nonetheless, based on (my personal observation) that models usually need to try multiple times to figure the correct way to call an API regarding an example-specific context, an alternative usage of the SPE, by allowing multiple turns for models to refine the API call based on playground feedback, might be more helpful.",
        "I am quite skeptical about the effectiveness of the Fisher information computed by perturbing the text input embedding. Such methods typically work well for continuous vision inputs but not for discrete text inputs, as also evidenced by the universal attack for LMs (Zou et al. 2023).

That said, this method seems cheaper in terms of data cost (no human annotators) so it may perform well on that axis. And I expect for major languages like Chinese and Portuguese it would be decent, almost like CoT for translation.",

If the context is too long and complex, or LLMs are not strong enough (e.g. in terms of respect to environment feedbacks/contexts), it is a little challenging. It also depends on both base model capability and post-training process.",

Therefore, a score of 5 is given. ",
        "There are key challenges with this work: 1) How do you know which events to prime it with? Finding the correct temporal context is a challenge in itself. 2) The method heavily relies on the fact that the model will align its generation to the temporal conditioning, which might or might not be true. 3) The suggested time periods in the dataset are too broad (eg. medieval). 4) This work requires retrieval to work well, however, if the retrieval is good enough it can be directly used to answer questions. 5) The metrics suggested do not make sense: For example does factual correctness mean that if the statement was correct at any point of time, then it is factually true? For example, if the model outputs that Earth is the center of the universe -- is this statement correct based on the Claudius Ptolemy era? 6) Temporal accuracy seems similar to the Anachronism Rate.",

        "The biggest issue with the proposed approach to tackle factuality is the lack of fact-verified source of information in the pipeline. The key step to obtain the factually correct and temporally consistent information is Step 2 (Factual Resonance Generation). Given this approach's reliability on LLM-generated output for fact verification, I can see its responses to be somewhat questionable with minimal trust in the approach.  Using GPT4 to evaluate plausibility goes somewhat against the basic foundations of factuality, and although interesting, using LLM-plausibility as an evaluation metric might have reprecussions.",

In fact, even in-context learning might be more effective than this.",

If evaluated with common calibration metrics like ECE, my intuition is that the improvements could be marginal or negative since the models are highly likely to give correct answers with random references. If the evaluation takes the correctness of references into account, I think the proposed method will work well but this is somehow out of line with general confidence estimation.",

It is widely known that compared with defense, jailbreaking/attacking an existing model is much easier in the adversarial attack field so I do not think the proposed defense method would work, and if that is the case, unfortunately, the execution results associated with this proposal cannot stand alone as a solid contribution.

For instance, if you have a similar dataset that originated in the 1800s, there were only a few professions that women could legally or even illegally pursue. How do you define which professions existed at that time, what the scope of possibilities is, and how do you ensure diversity in real-world scenarios under these conditions?

Anyway, according to my reading of the question (Who was the director of the movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year that Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States?) the \"won ... in the same year\" refers to the year that the Oscar was actually awarded (as opposed to year that the movie came out), and so I find the baseline answer with CoT to be correct. In fact, using GPT-4 (one of the models set for evaluation), when I changed the question to \"Who was the director of the movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture RELEASED in the same year that Barack Obama was first inaugurated as President of the United States?\" (just adding \"released\"), I got the correct response of \"The Hurt Locker\", which is what the author declares as the correct answer to the original question. However, I disagree based on my reading of the question.",
        "It is unclear to me how adding a step to verify the output and further break it down can guarantee that the model will eventually provide an answer to the question. What if the model simply doesn't know the answer to the question?",
        "Seems like an obvious way to improve long-form coherency even if short-form text fluency is not that great. A story that makes sense but has grammatical errors is much better than a story that does not make sense at all. I expect the guidance to really improve scores on whatever evals are run.",
        "It could generate stories that might be better, but I don't have any strong intuition on whether it will work. Moreover, the authors of this idea mentioned plagiarism as a concern, and don't evaluate that. ",
        "There's no mentioning on how to prompt the model to generate defensive strategies and refine the model's responses using these strategies. Besides, the jailbreak techniques mentioned in the research plan are mostly designed for BERT classification tasks.",

However, bootstrapping generation could also leads to issues such as redundancy or repetition. Therefore, it's hard to say how significant the improvement will be. ",
        "This approach boils down to asking the model to self-identify potential hallucinations and correcting them. The pipeline could yield results with compounded errors without effective checking mechanism. Based on literature review, I also doubt the accuracy of self-identification of hallucinations.",
        "The reason behind hallucination is not 100% clear yet. It could be the incapabilities of model to comprehend a context or lack of information. If some cases, the model could still hallucinate on either mirage modeling or inversion attempt. The model can gets into a circular hallucination cycle with CMI-HM since it does not using any external knowledge and the entire pipeline is self-enclosed. Asking the model \"highlight any parts you're unsure about\" might not get good answers because the sampled generation might mean that they are confident on their hallucinations and therefore won't self-correct.",
        "The proposed method has a good chance of outperforming existing baselines due to its combined approach of using both neural networks and symbolic rules. This dual approach can potentially handle the unique grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions found in low-resource languages better than purely neural or symbolic methods alone.",

        "I think LLM-debate type of method will work for obtaining a more comprehensive method. But I am not sure how much it will outpeforms with baseline as I did a sanity check myself with the example question. Instead of prompting the model to answer \"What is the capital of France?\", I use the following prompt:  What is the capital of France? The question may differ when considering from different perspectives. Please provide me with a comprehensive answer.  GPT-4 Output: The capital of France is Paris, a fact that is straightforward from a geographical and political perspective. Paris serves as the central hub of French governance and culture, hosting major institutions such as the President's residence, the French Parliament, and numerous cultural landmarks.  From different perspectives, one might still consider Paris as the capital, but with various emphases:  Historical Perspective: Paris has been the capital since the 6th century, except for brief periods, such as when the government was moved to Vichy during World War II.  Economic Perspective: Paris is the economic capital, home to the La D\u00e9fense business district, which is one of the largest in Europe, and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture.  Cultural Perspective: It's also seen as the cultural capital, with landmarks like the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and Notre-Dame, which are symbols of French history and artistry.  Administrative Perspective: As the seat of government and the location of various ministries, Paris is the administrative capital of France.  Symbolic Perspective: Paris represents France internationally, symbolizing its values, history, and influence, making it the symbolic capital.  Each perspective emphasizes different aspects of what makes Paris the capital, aligning with its multifaceted role in France and the world.  Claude-3-Sonnet Ouput: The capital of France is Paris. This is a straightforward and widely accepted fact from political, administrative, and cultural perspectives. However, you're right that there can be different angles to consider:  Political/Administrative capital: Paris is unequivocally the seat of the French government and the official capital. Historical perspective: Paris has been the capital for most of French history since the Middle Ages, with a few brief exceptions (e.g., Vichy during part of World War II). Economic capital: Paris is also France's economic hub, though some might argue that other cities like Lyon or Marseille play important economic roles. Cultural capital: Paris is generally considered the cultural heart of France, though other regions and cities have their own distinct cultural identities. European context: Paris is one of the major capitals in the European Union and hosts several EU institutions, though it's not the official capital of the EU (Brussels largely serves that role). Global city status: Paris is recognized as a global city and often represents France on the world stage. Regional perspective: Some advocates of decentralization might argue for recognizing other cities as important centers, though this doesn't change Paris's official status.  While there can be nuanced discussions about the roles of different French cities, from most practical and official standpoints, Paris is considered the capital of France. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this topic?  The GPT-4 output fails to output other answers for this question and is very confident with the answer \"Paris\"; but Claude-3-Sonnet has already covers different possibilities even we only change the prompt a bit.",

However, this might be wrong in the first place. Secondly, relevance is a very vague definition. The given prompt will very likely include not important paragraphs in the context. The last confusion I have is in the example: why baseline model only has access to first 1000 token of the input document, when the proposed method has full access? I don't think this is a fair comparison.",

Also, chain-of-thought itself has also been shown unfaithful and non-robust in many papers. So it is very unlikely that the uncertainty measurement obtained in this way would succeed. ",

        "I am very skeptical of this approach. I think it will be largely restricted to the model's capability of doing chain-of-thought reasoning, which has been known to be correlating with scales. ",
        "It seems like a lot of models today will avoid explicitly stating stereotypes like the one in the example (i.e., \"usually female\"), and sometimes even simple interventions (e.g., system prompt like the one here: https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/guardrailing/) can avoid these. Instead, it seems like the more persistent biases are more subtle (that I would expect to remain even with simple prompting interventions) such as dialect prejudice (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00742), but these forms of bias are not directly evaluated, at least in the way that I interpret the description of \"stereotype-sensitive queries across various domains\" in Step 1. I do think that if these forms of bias were included in the queries, though, that this method could provide improvements over the baselines.",
        "The proposed method could be effective in challenging stereotypes more comprehensively, rather than superficially.

If they're asking for credibility given the question, I'd be concerned the model would have the same \"high similarity to the question = high convincingness\" issue observed in the original ConflictingQA paper or that the model could continue to prefer passages that confirm parametric knowledge (simply marking them as more \"credible\"). If they're asking for credibility independent of the question, I'd need some convincing that this is a feasible/useful exercise. ",

Second, it is not intuitive for LLMs to process and generate code-switched texts, which could degrade the pipeline's performance compared to using a pivot language. However, the ablation and fallback plans sound reasonable and could provide interesting insights regardless of whether the proposed method will outperform SOTA methods.",

If there are multiple concepts close to each other (say, in a cluster) and only one of them needs to unlearned, it is highly likely that this approach will have cascading effects.",

It is plausible that in most cases, the model might end up generating generic queries that do not really challenge the model\u2019s confidence or fail to generate queries that highlight implicit assumptions in the original model answer. Furthermore, it is not clear if model confidence or explanations for the adversarial queries would be reasonably calibrated themselves to be really useful in calibrating the final model confidence. Given these unknowns, I suspect if this approach would be able to beat baselines across domains/datasets. Additionally, this approach might only work in cases where there is semantic uncertainty (due to implicit assumptions or presupposition) in the query that could be challenged by the alternative semantic interpretations.

So compared to the baseline (directly asking the model to determine malice), the proposed idea should be effective.     - On the second axis, however, it\u2019s unclear whether the procedure would be result in over-refusal. Observe that the proposed idea asks to construct additional malicious input examples (using pre-defined malicious tasks), *regardless of whether the original input is actually malicious*. This means that a neutral input (\"write a position on why US should ban guns\") would now be rejected.          - That is, the proposed idea can have high false-positive rates.",
        "I am skeptical because I think such prompting approach might overlook some malicious inputs generated by gradient-based attacks",
        "I rated this idea a 6 because incorporating cultural nuances at multiple levels (word, sentence, and culture) could significantly enhance the quality of translations, especially for low-resource languages where cultural context is often overlooked. However, the effectiveness may vary depending on the quality of cultural datasets and the adaptability of the models to these new inputs.",
        "As explained above, the method has major flaws. In addition, it is not clear that the evaluation dataset contains enough culturally sensitive terms to make a difference.",
        "With specific prompting techniques, the proposed method should outperform baselines in term of temporal dependencies",
        "I am not very confident that the model can solve this complex temporally-depending programming problems with a reasonable correctness. Furthermore, because the current method is basically prompting, which may have a very low performance upper-bound. Therefore, I don't expect the proposed method to improve significantly on code generation.",
        "One needs to build reasonable metric to show effectiveness. Also, one might need to tune prompts carefully to construct high-quality graph in this case.",
        "Based on the authors' provided examples and the related works: Similar related works: \"Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14627). They both demonstrate that these methods can perform better than the baseline.",
        "I think this might not work as the reference generation process itself could cause additional hallucination. "

        "Just not an interesting area in my opinion. Scope is too narrow to be impactful and existing non-prompting methods will do much better.",
        "I am not convinced by the core assumption here of using the graph.",
        "The idea has been address by other papers, and the difference is marginal. I don't have any new (expected) conclusion learned from this proposal, thus not excited. ",
        "While I think there are ways to make this an interesting contribution focusing on  some specific kind of reason of focusing on diversion chain of cards that are  started from like symbolic reasoning or some kind of pre-informed decisions  rather than asking them to generate the first three instances the way that is  proposed right now doesn't make a contribution that would be exciting or impactful.",
        "I do not feel excited about the idea because it does not seem more effective than existing methods. The execution plan does not seem complete either. However, it might still be worth exploring whether this proposed way of presenting counter-factual descriptions in the prompt can mitigate biases in LLMs. ",
        "The excitement score here mostly relates to novelty for me: this approach is very similar to previous ones, with the main difference being the exact prompt. Also, gender bias mitigation  is probably the best-addressed form of bias right now, and it seems hard to extend this to other demographic attributes where there is more room for improvement. (For example, I'm not sure how you would extend \"traditionally feminine traits\" to \"traditionally [ethnicity/religion/nationality] traits\" without resulting in rather offensive prompts.)",
        "The idea is simple and straightforward, but I don't think it make sense to me, as I explained in the previous sections. ",
        "It is an interesting project and likely useful for industrial applications. Yet I think methodologies-wise there is not a lot of majorly exciting novelty. It will be a bit hard to justify why do we need this divide-and-conquer style of decomposing when we have very long-context LLMs.",
        "The trained models and methodology could be useful for SRS applications. I just worry that the approach itself for synthetic data is not that novel.",
        "As elaborated in the previous sections, this idea is very simple and has little novelty in terms of research value. It targets at a quite narrow and niche problem and is unlikely to have non-incremental effect. ",
        "Overall the idea is not making significant advancement in the current uncertainty quantification research, not proposing any new ideas or questions, and very likely not working in general application scenarios as explained above. So I am not exciting about this proposed idea. ",
        "If the method works, I could imagine some follow-up work it could inspire (e.g., these poles could be a useful boundary object in human-AI decision-making), but I couldn\u2019t imagine it having a major impact. Assuming their claim that this pole method is somewhat close to how humans calibrate their uncertainty, leaning on this could make the project more exciting to certain subgroups. ",
        "Since I don't believe this idea would work, I'm not excited about it. If it were to work I'd be surprised and thus more excited about it (it would show that LLMs really struggle with things they probably know but can't use wo this method). ",
        "I think low-resource languages are pretty hard to process so if it works, the proposed method would be very useful. Also, given the current trend of scaling, the low-resource languages won't be easily solved or directly solved by the next generation of LLM since we just don't have enough data for scale. A smarter way to tackle this challenge is very needy.",
        "I think this work is exciting enough to be accepted. However I think it's not going to be very impactful.",
        "It is a novel approach to use existing LLM to generate semantic fog.",
        "A well-formed paper based on this proposal (with ablation study and human evaluation) is exciting enough to be accepted. 6 is given because the idea feels somewhat homogenous with some of the concurrent papers",
        "The main problem is that there are already a lot of works which utilize concepts and principles to enhance LLM reasoning. The proposed idea is not novel enough and can provide few new insights on the benefits of LLM-generated concepts in mathematical reasoning.",
        "First I don't think this will work. Second I think it's just a more complicated (more constraint) version of chain of thought that won't work well in a realistic setting or existing datasets. Introducing hard concepts dates back to the old days of knowledge graphs, which was proved to be not very useful in the LLM era.",
        "This project could significantly impact the field by providing a more robust parsing method for low-resource languages and vernaculars. The combination of neural and symbolic approaches can deepen our understanding of these languages and improve NLP applications, making it an exciting and influential contribution.",
        "The story of neuro-symbolic vernacular parsing is pretty cool and it's also meanful for this domain. ",
        "I must say the score above is somewhat arbitrary. I would definitely give the idea a positive score, but the exact score would depend on the execution and the new insights that it produces. It certainly has the potential to be an 8 or 9 if it is successful as a debiasing technique and reveals fascinating new insights about biases in language models. However, depending on the results (both quantitative and qualitative), it could be a 6 as well.",
        "May be effective but the novelty is limited and lack of insights.",
        "Even considering the constraints I previously mentioned regarding unbiased generation and real-world limitations, I still believe there are several positives to be gained from this proposal. I think it would be particularly interesting to explore which pivot prompts are effective and which are not, to identify the necessary analogies, and to determine how many in-context examples are needed. For instance, the current proposal lacks any in-context examples. One aspect not mentioned in the fallback plan, but that I would like to see included\u2014 and which can be addressed within the scope of this project\u2014 is a comparison between using in-context examples and employing pivot prompts that essentially force the generation into a specific latent space. Additionally, I would like to see how this approach compares to pre-filling versus using a more traditional system prompt. It would be beneficial to distinguish between all these methods of unbiased generation. ",
        "I think this should be more exiciting than most of the borderline papers since we are working on a new problem. The collected data should also be super useful.",
        "Overall, I don't expect this method to bring substantial improvements, hence am less excited how the potential of this method. It would still be an interesting problem to solve, particularly in bringing more challenging coding problems and proposed corresponding methods. With this being said, given the current performance of models, building a solid benchmark regarding this temporal code generation problem may be more exciting that proposing a method that is expectedly not working.",
        "This is novel and could have huge impact on those code generation cases requiring temporal dependencies. But one needs to justify why such use cases are important, and why  temporal dependency is the core problem in such use cases.",
        "same above",
        "I'm excited to see this deployed. The approach much more accurately reflects how software problems are currently solved. Additionally, it appears more robust to errors within the LMs.",
        "I think it's extremely weird that for a domain like code, which is special in the sense that model outputs are executable, this method does not actually attempt to execute the code. It only forces the model to simulate execution. I think this is a handicap that is not practical in the real world. It's interesting from a research perspective whether models can execute code line by line, but I don't think that this would be a super relevant finding.",
        "The research topic itself is very exciting and impactful. While I'm not quite confident about the pratical effectiveness of the proposed method (i.e., augmenting LMs with a symoblic machine for selecting approporiate APIs), I believe its a reasonable baseline that worth exploring as the first step.",
        "Combining neural and symbolic methods is an interesting idea and may have broader implications on what are things suitable for LLMs versus what are things that we should still rely on symbolic systems.",
        "The technique heavily relies on the type of models you are using. Some models might have high confidence on all their outputs. Moreover, the research tries to solve a niche problem of hallucinations in identities.",
        "Overall, I think it could be a good idea to test although novelty is lacking. Self-ask prompting could have potentials as it potentially shows the model has the reasoning capability if the question is asked correctly.",
        "The main reason for the low score here is that I don't see the idea of working, especially due to the lack of transparency and the unexplained expectation of calculating and calibrating an LLM's response confidence. Additionally, there is a presupposed assumption that hallucinations in LLMs are ungrounded and independent of the data they are trained on, which is generally not considered true. It is very likely that hallucinations between different models remain the same based on total comparisons between these models. ",
        "It's a somewhat interesting idea which I would be curious to find out the results of. However, even the motivating examples in the proposal are very uninspiring. If the extent of cultural awareness I'm interested in is just at the level of making sure various wedding cultures are considered, I'm certain I can get away by just explicitly asking the model. The whole effort of translating and aggregating seems superfluous. It would be interesting, however, if there were more subtle but measurable ways in which this method could help with cultural bias. The proposal makes no such note though.",
        "I do not agree with the design of the problem fundamentally. I will fight for rejection unless the authors could justify why it is important/desirable for a model to answer a woman wearing Qipao in a Chinese wedding when the question is in English with no Chinese culture specified. The strive for cultural awareness and inclusiveness should not be achieved at the cost of utility (e.g., generating a large amount of information that a user is not seeking). The research idea is seriously flawed.",
        "I did not buy much from this method. This method may improve the structural diverse but I am not sure about the quality itself.",
        "I put seven here, because to me the progress is extremely dependent on how well it works.  If this \"solves\" low resource translation than obviously it is hugely exciting.  More than likely I think it will be an incremental improvement to low resource translation which is great!  I don't think it would change the understanding of the field however.  Linguists are already quite aware of typological similarities between languages so it is not altogether surprising if this helps language models with translations.  Also computational linguists already use typological similarity to inform machine translation training distributions so the main difference in contribution is that putting this into the prompt may help.",
        "The framing is interesting and example scenario is also kinda interesting --- trying to incrementally draw out the model's understanding of the world. But the example and description somehow is not intuitive enough to deliver the \"punchline\" of this method to me.",
        "I don\u2019t think this work would lead to major changes in the field, but (especially if it works well) I could imagine some follow up work being inspired by this. To be fair, some of what I would imagine as follow-up work is at least alluded to in the proposal (esp. in the proposed fallback plan and, to a lesser extent, the ablations), but I sincerely doubt everything in the proposal would fit into a single paper in the first place.",
        "Cultural awareness is a very important topic, and creating new data and evaluating current models for this task in new languages could make significant progress. ",
        "This is indeed interesting topic. Think I saw similar paper for this. and the main issue was how thoroughly the researcher do the evaluation. ",
        "I don't think it will work but if it does it would be pretty cool. The domain is interesting and the application of CoT to it is new.",
        "If the proposed method works, it not only improves performance on low-resource language tasks, it would also offer valuable insights into LLMs' understanding of phonetic information in low resource languages, which could be interesting to a wide range of research. The method, as proposed at this stage, feels incremental as it only modifies a standard CoT prompt to instruct the LLM to consider additional information, but I can see the method being refined (e.g. validation of each step, more reliance on existing linguistic tools such as phonemizers) and the ablation study would potentially be very interesting. ",
        "Boring idea that won't be interestingly effective.",
        "This could be contributing, but the solution requires specific error type, making the method hardly generalizable to new math tasks.",
        "Ultimately this is a prompting strategy for code generation which typically I would not find super exciting, however the fact that this approach was validated and did work quite well https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00994 makes me more excited.   I think this opens up many followup questions about what else can be explored for the property driven test case development.  Besides functional properties, and non-functional requirements, perhaps there are aesthetic or maintainability preferences that can steer the code generation.  And what would checks for such properties look like?",
        "The idea of creating tests and conducting reasoning using PBT is interesting. However, the current experiment design fail to cover the most important aspect this method could bring. In addition to testing the improvement on code generation correctness, it could also be important to demonstrate PBT as a new way to create new datasets/augment current datasets with comprehensive test cases. Experiment related to this could be measuring the program coverage of original unit tests and these PBT tests. ",
        "Overall, I think bringing PBT to LLM code generation domain, as part of the methods for test case generation is definitely useful. The message that PBT helps can be useful to the community, and efficacy of NL-based PBT is also a interesting topic. However, besides NL-based PBT, the novelty and technical contributions of the paper is somewhat limited. And I'm not certain about the possible impact of the paper.",
        "I think it's an exciting idea but I'm not optimistic about the results. It is hard to separate the two.",
        "Given we already have VQA and the task can be formulated as multimodal QA, I'm not sure if it was already explored in that field.",
        "As said, I think the overall idea is interesting and it is an important topic to make LLMs trustworthy in real world. However, the method should be built on previous work and should be clear of the research questions in this field.",
        "The general direction of the proposal is interesting. It would be useful to develop solutions to adapt uncertainty expression to domain and user preference. However, the proposed plan does not seem to offer a clear solution plan towards that goal. ",
        "As mentioned earlier, while I'm not aware of any work adopting the exact same method, I personally feel all the elements in the method are studies before and thus the novelty and excitement is limited.",
        "I don't think this idea is very impactful as it proposes a prompting technique that's similar to and/or built on top of existing prompting techniques for code generation. It is a relatively straightforward prompting idea that is not very technically challenging, even though it's likely to be effective on some coding questions. ",
        "This project could significantly impact the field by improving LLM performance in low-resource languages, addressing a critical gap in current research. The novel approach and potential for broader applications make it an exciting and influential contribution.",
        "I think that this idea shows some promise for improving generations in different dialects, but I do not feel like it is substantial enough to be a highly influential paper. The reliance on parallel texts seems like a bottleneck to wider adoption.",
        "While interesting, the idea is not very exciting to me as others. This is because having an agent focus on a specific emotion and average over the emotions does not seem successful or the direction conversational agents should go in. Some emotions have stronger weighting than others in different contexts. ",
        "I do not see the reason why we need a Muti-agent system, probably because the idea proposal does not motivate the idea well. The evaluation metric is also unclear. I am not sure what benefits the proposed system would bring to a user. If I were a user, I would actually prefer the baseline response in the example than the InsideOut approach. ",
        "The suggested approach seems pretty targeted toward doing well on the EmpatheticDialogues dataset (emotion classifier label needs to match the emotion in each example on that dataset), and I expect it would do well on that. However, if trying to measure deeper issues like the appropriateness of the response more broadly (e.g. if human evaluation were performed) I am not fully convinced that this method would outperform strong baselines like the default response, or prompting the model to always be empathetic.",
        "As mentioned above, using counterfactuals to obtain uncertainty estimates seems fairly novel, but this may be because it's simply not that reasonable or good of an idea.  I don't think that the idea as stated would be an effective way to obtain epistemic uncertainty estimates from a model.",
        "The tree would be an interesting successful way of measuring consistency and reliability in LLMs which means that the results would show interesting bits - however, the technical contribution could still be larger to be more impactful.",
        "Constraining CoT breakdowns is a novel idea and deserve more work and exploration. While the use of semantic similarity has many drawbacks (such as tuning the threshold, task-sensitive, non scalable), it can still show us some valuable results about constraining CoT breakdowns.",
        "The method is not that novel and I think the method is not that effective and might not solve the problem at all. ",
        "The proposed method is too similar to existing works, it doesn't contain novel insights that would meaningfully boost current LM performance, or introduce new ideas worth building on. It would not be an exciting paper.",
        "The idea is generally interesting. The authors should compare with KV-cache or embedding-based methods serving the same purpose. The authors should have a clear idea on how retrieval+re-rank works and what the state-of-the-art methods are in the retrieval comunnity.",
        "Overall I think the idea is interesting, but has a lot of confusions. I would be more convinced with more detailed explanation and results. ",
        "It is generally interesting to know if large language models can mimic human behavior in various cases. Humans have spent thousands of years on finding ways and rules to conduct debate. Debate and persuasion have also been in an important role in human interaction. On the other hand, it is also a good perspective to evaluate how models can act as different personas.",
        "Red team strategy was frequently used in multi agent debate, and there are works already showed that factuality can be improved with such setting. Adding judge agent is also investigated. ",
        "Same as above. The idea is not very novel, and I am not sure how effective the proposed method would be.",
        "I address this a little more in the overall score, but I am not extremely excited by this idea. My lack of excitement originates from the fact that I think the method makes incorrect assumptions of what is normatively desired from a debiased language model. There are some interesting bits that are actually in the fallback plans, such as how language models reason about societal changes over time or what biases might be more resistant to temporal decay simulation. But this is less about debasing the model and more about inspecting what world views are being encoded in the model. ",
        "I think this is a good research idea that is worth trying implementing, and the community will be interested in learning about the debiasing effectiveness. If this method turns out to be ineffective, there is still the value to study how the model envisions the future based on the past examples. The qualitative analysis of the model's description about the ideal equitable future could contribute to social science studies and inform policy-makers. ",
        "This project is exciting because it tackles a real-world problem with significant implications for the accessibility and inclusivity of AI technologies.",
        "However, the  methods in the prompt is not novel. Feel like moving existing methods into LLM prompting.",
        "As mentioned, the idea is very incremental and involves combining prompt templates from 2 separate papers. I believe this wouldn't give any insights on how to improve multilingual capabilities of LLMs.",
        "This project could significantly impact the field by improving LLM performance in low-resource languages, addressing a critical gap in current research. The novel approach and potential for broader applications make it an exciting and influential contribution.",

        "The contribution is not at all new.",
        "The research problem and methodology would be interesting to many researchers who are working on improving the responsibility of LLMs and AI models. This proposal provides a potential way to mitigate the LLM harms and risks.",
        "The idea of generating diverse dataset in toxic classification using LLM agents are novel and could bring non-trivial improvement on adversarial input detection. However, overall the project lack a fundamental difference from the current approach of data augmentation using LLMs.",
        "The impact seems limited to me. I guess the best way to improve coding for LLM is through trial in the real environments and learn from errors. However, this idea is more like a self critique?",
        "The problem setting is interesting, while there are already work training llms to optimize the code.",
        "As mentioned above, the adversarial paraphrasing -> UQ angle is interesting. But there are some issues with correctness/effectiveness that make the proposal less exciting.",
        "The overall idea is very interesting. It would be interesting to see if LLMs can pinpoint implicit assumptions that challenge model answers to specific queries and whether explicating these examples help model calibrate their uncertainty estimates. ",
        "I'm not sure how well this method will transfer to future models, and this could be a limiting factor in the longevity of this research. (But this is a limitation of all prompting research...)",
        "The ability to do prompting/few-shot translation is fundamentally tied to the training data, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10266, so trying to solve this problem from the prompting space is inherently limited.",
        "I think if we find a way for LLMs to generate non-factual sentences reliably  based on certain conditions I think it would be really interesting as a  research progress both for identifying non-factual statements in the wild as  well as for the proposed method of generating more factual information such  that the non-factual statements can be used on the database and if this project  works as proposed it can be used for different research directions where  people have to presently write such hateful and non-factual statements  whereas we can now generate a bunch of them and ensure that there is adherence for  moderation that relies on these tangentially generated content",
        "Not well-motivated. No applicable scenarios in real life.",
        "Low excitement, as method is not novel and will likely be ineffective.",
        "LLMs are certainly not trained on more than a handful of high-resourced languages. The idea heavily depends upon LLMs' monolingual capabilities and there is no avenue to go beyond what they already know. Overall, the idea simply breaks up chain-of-though style prompting into 4 steps and it doesn't make any contributions beyond that.",
        "However, the improvement of the quality is expected. ",
        "Challending LLM is a frequently examined topic, and the pipeline does not guarantee a performance increase - if an LLM has been making mistakes (hallucination) on the original question, it might be rigid on its original idea. Furthermore, summarization LLM may also hallucinates.",
        "It\u2019s unclear to me how many more \u201csecond negative questions\u201d could be asked and how often the models being tested would change their responses. It\u2019s also unclear how one would judge whether a response was given before for open-ended questions, aside from using an LM judge of sorts. I would find this work exciting if it turned out to work extremely well, which I don\u2019t expect.",
        "The idea proposes a new self refinement prompting method, thus it is not completely novel and can be think of as a subset of previously proposed method (always providing a negative feedback). It would be interesting (not mentioned in the proposal) to connect the behavior of negative questioning with model uncertainty, though.",
        "I think I'd find this project more interesting if it was further broken down into more concretely actionable steps.",
        "If this approach would work I think that the main contribution of it would be in linguistics, rather than NLP. Thus, it would show the importance of etymology for translation and the fact that there's a common structure across languages. This would make an interesting finding. However, the contribution to NLP/AI/ML is limited.  ",
        "The novelty is somewhat limited since similar ideas have been proposed, and thus the paper may not be inspiring enough.",
        "It's not that much different from self-consistency in my opinion. We need to find extra evidence to show how it can be better than self-consistency, etc. Also the \"hierarchical\" aspect is not clear to me. ",
        "I think this idea is exciting and I would like to see the results of this project. But I don't think that this idea is going to change the field or be very influential.",
        "As stated before, the idea just apply self-verification/improvements manner in code generation setting and focus on a relative small scope (invariants in code).",
        "The idea simply doesn't make sense to me. Given current LLMs' ability, I'm pretty sure they can simply recite code like inserting data to a binary search tree. The setting of the problem doesn't make sense to me.",
        "Cultural awareness is a very important topic, and creating new data and evaluating current models for this task in new languages could make significant progress. ",
        "This is indeed interesting topic. Think I saw similar paper for this. and the main issue was how thoroughly the researcher do the evaluation. ",
        "The solution does not seem to be able to solve the hallunication problem of LLM",
        "As written in my response to the previous questions, this idea does not seem very novel and might not work effectively. So I am leaning negative.",
        "I gave a borderline score as the proposed method intuitively makes sense, especially for more sophisticated tasks. However, to make it work, I think there needs to be more smart designs about the verification, the strategy proposal part, etc. I also have low hope that this will actually work. It is also not fundamentally different from chain of thought.",
        "The paper should be sufficient with a successful prompt strategy along with enough analysis.",
        "The proposal addresses an important issue, so in general I am excited about work that attempts to mitigate biases in LLMs. However, I am not convinced by the novelty or effectiveness of the method suggested. This seems to be incremental work on top of the current literature exploring cultural and linguistic biases in LLMs. ",
        "It really depends how this project is done in reality. If the proposed method can be generalized to many settings, it will be influential for sure. However, I can also see that this idea being done in a shallow and not exciting way. ",
        "Code generation is an prevalent topic nowadays due to the advancement of LLMs. This project aims to improve the LLM's capability on code generation, which I think will be interested to many people.",
        "This idea tackles an important problem of the field, insufficient test for code generation. The proposed method should bring some improvements, which may be interesting to a lot of people in the field. ",
        "I would consider this idea more as a small but effective test-time trick. I don't think the proposed method gonna deep any understanding of LMs or make major progress in this research direction. And I also don't think the proposed method could inspire future works a lot.",
        "It's quite easy to think of this idea in my opinion. It's not exciting because it combines two mainstream research topics (contrastive debiasing and intersectional bias) together and situate it in the current LLMs. ",
        "Would like to see the result. But again, the prompting itself sound not difficult, but verification of the quality of output sounds hard.",
        "It still has limitations on how one can curate such concepts and how one can effectively evaluate the differences in explanations automatically. I'm also not clear on how effective the method would be for concepts that are culturally exclusive. ",
        "The idea has some potential but ultimately, I don't think it will be effective or meaningful change prompting approaches. Current in-context learning approaches tend to elicit the best responses.",
        "While I don't think I've seen this exact method before, it is simply adding a verification step to in-context knowledge editing. If the novelty lies in accessing in-context editing's effectiveness on multi-hop reasoning, there has been prior work that proposes dataset and tackles this problem (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12976 and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14795).",
        "I think this would be an exciting paper that would be well received by the scholars who are domain experts. I would expect it to make less of an impact on the broader AI / ML community.",
        "The intersection of law and LLMs is definitely not my specialty. However, I think that it's quite cool to see LLMs and retrieval combined in this way to impact a field  which relies a lot on retrieving from existing precedent and meticulously laying out the reasoning step behind an argument.",
        "I think it would be effective for the same reason chain of thought is effective. However, still incremental based on how it builds on CoT work. I do think, if well executed, is good enough for a AI conference.",
        "The idea contains some good starting points, and some components are subject to somewhat obvious improvemen. Taking such expected improvement into account, I think the result could be interesting.",
        "The research question that this proposal aims to address is critical, especially bridging the gaps of human intents with code generation implementation. ",
        "The general idea and the running example is great, but need additional justifications: 1. this paper needs to compare with RAG baselines and clearly states what's the difference from RAG methods. 2. It looks like the api usage style might also be the contribution. The author needs to design effective evaluation metrics to show that. ",
        "There have been several works with similar ideas, so this project wouldn't be fully new to the world. But the domain of API",
        "It is interesting to leverage the models' self-estimation of confidence to guide the use of external knowledge or more self-reflection, but it is unclear to me why and if this selective improvement could beat using external information/self-reflection from the very begining. ",
        "To my knowledge, this is the first idea that I have seen to explicitly separate different parts in the generation w.r.t. confidence levels. Compared with previous works that seek methods for better confidence calibration, this is already interesting. Then, adaptive generate strategy is proposed for different confidence levels to boost the performance. I think this work serve as an interesting starting point in confidence calibration strategies.",
        "If this pipeline works, then I think it could serve as a fairly general approach to dealing with varying levels of uncertainty in LLM answers. Having LLMs switch between different modes of operation depending on how confident they are about an answer could be an interesting new approach to interacting with these models.",
        "As mentioned previously, there is existing work which has tried similar proposals, to mixed success. Even if moderately successful, the proposal does not seem to include further analysis compared to what has already been done, and therefore it seems unlikely to be particularly transformative or impactful. ",
        "Excited with the expectation of controlling the behavior of the LLM. However, not very exciting to see another prompting methods that use negative examples to improve the Low resouce MT.",
        "I think the idea is rather straightforward and not very exciting. The approach will be cost-and time-inefficient in real world due to the nature of the modified generation pipeline, limiting its wider applicability. ",
        "The idea is not well-motivated and less intuitive. The effectiveness is not promising. The method is over-simplified.",
        "Even if this idea ends up working and you achieve better text, I don't think it's scalable, especially given the amount of input and output tokens required. Currently, the study is only being conducted with around 100 words, but if you end up generating three pages of content, at some point you would have so much context involved that you would run out of output token space. I also want to know how you would avoid issues like self-contradiction or repetition. For example, if something is stated in the first line but contradicted in the last line, there is no extraction of facts or information being compared against. You are still relying heavily on the model's internal knowledge and the context provided, hoping that the model utilizes the entire lengthy context supplied to it.",
        "The project would be more impactful, if it can clearly define what exactly is the \"semantic error\". The current version doesn't have much difference with existing CoT+unit test methods.",
        "The idea is similar to the existing studies on code generation with LLM. Therefore it is not exciting enough.",
        "I think this idea won't be effective enough to impact the field. Although some of the fallback plans for exmaple ensamble of models might work better and get accepted in conferences.",
        "Given that similar ideas has been proposed in at least three different research branches, and unclear implementation plans, it is hard to tell what contribution this project can make.  Even the experiment results may look good, for the community, this process will significantly add burdens in inference time as it needs multiple sampling processes running for even a single user prompt, so perhaps this is just an interesting \"finding\". ",
        "I am leaning positive if it works effectively. But I do not have full confidence in its effectiveness, per my response to the last question.",
        "The idea of breaking down a problem into sub-problems is intutive, and if successful, this could be an interesting work for the sub-community.",
        "This idea targets theorem proving, which is a difficult task even for humans. If the task can be solved by the proposed method, it will be exciting.",
        "Existing work on adversarial attack generation has not explored using such a way to producing diverse attacks. Using related adversarial scenarios to generate new attacks is a neat way of sidestepping safety filters and finding new scenarios altogether. Using this idea in an iterative or self-refine setting could also produce unpredictable but adversarial outputs.",
        "This plug-and-play idea makes contributions to LLM safeguarding if the improvement is significant. Otherwise it's hard to imagine it will inspire a line of meaningful new research.",
        "Given that the proposed method is vague, I am unsure about its contributions and effectiveness, and therefore I feel less excited about it.",
        "Seems like an impactful and ambitious outcome if completed. I am curious how such an approach fits into the conversation about general agents, which can leverage API/tool/functions calls.  It's a little unclear from the toy example why existing function calling models can't translate NL intents into. ",
        "The idea looks similar to a lot of existing works using tree search to tackle complex reasoning tasks. It does not provide insights on why ToT prompting should be applied on the specific domain of mathematical proofs. Also, the comparison with the chosen baselines is not fair. The idea needs further refinement to justify its novelty, core contribution, and insights given the challenges in the field.",
        "Again, this just seems to be an application of the Tree of Thought work to a slightly different domain (they do consider math problems). Given the incremental nature of this works, I am doubtful of the impact of this idea.",
        "If the proposed method works, it is likely to impact using information or knowledge without giving away any identifiers, which could lead to better use of sensitive data in the future.",
        "Besides the limitations mentioned above, I think the model would be hard to scale up, which downgrades the excitement of me on this project. Also, some middle steps require manual efforts, such as create a unique set of concepts.",

        "Again, I think this research idea brings very marginal knowledge to what we've learned about RAG.",
        "Leaning negative because the proposed idea is not very novel. Besides, it is not clear to me how quotes are being generated or retrieved, so a bit hard to decide. ",
        "The reason I gave this paper score of 4 is that, while the idea is interesting, similar concepts have already been implemented. Additionally, there is another paper that. examines how citations work in relation to perplexity and whether the citations align. The score remains a 4 rather than an 8, despite its potential impact, because the idea lacks clarity on technical details, particularly regarding how to evaluate entailment in these. cases. Furthermore, it does not address. what to do in instances where there isn't a dataset to verify the citation information. It also raises concerns about how to measure citations or scores across a large set of documents while managing latency issues and maintaining a coherent chain of thought, which requires multi-step reasoning and verification of all those steps. ",
        "As mentioned briefly above, since this idea is similar to some existing works, it is more likely to make a marginal contribution. However, depending on the insights from the experiments (as mentioned in the Fallback plan), it is still likely that this idea can be pivoted to something else more effective and/or more impactful.

Although I like the broader implications of such technique being able to develop better temporal factual consistencies catered to individuals for personalized learning, at its face value the way it is presented in the generated idea, I find is somewhat incremental.",
        "I think that the issues with prompting LLMs to take on different societal personas has known shortcomings, but the analysis with real native speakers of different languages could be a major contribution of this work. The latter part is what I am more excited about, but this would make the project more of a sociolinguistic study.",
        "This project could be highly impactful by advancing our understanding of how language models can be adapted to different social and cultural contexts. The ability to generate culturally appropriate and contextually nuanced language would be a significant contribution to NLP, particularly in the realm of multilingual and low-resource language processing. ",
        "It is a novel approach to use existing LLM to generate semantic fog.",
        "A well-formed paper based on this proposal (with ablation study and human evaluation) is exciting enough to be accepted. 6 is given because the idea feels somewhat homogenous with some of the concurrent papers",
        "Easy to bring up but hard to implement",
        "This would be an empirical paper on how to train and use a multi-step multi-image reasoning VLMs.The community will likely find it very useful.",
        "The retrieval part of the project sounds interesting enough, and if this idea actually works, I will be very curious to know for which cases retrieval really helps. I think for cases that retrieval is able to bring improvement are worth investigating more in the future.",
        "The idea does not make sense to me at all so I gave a 2. Not 1 because part of it (retrieving relevant sub tasks) is still novel and can be turned into something reasonable.",
        "The proposed method is more scalable and efficient than RAG but it is poorly motivated. Why prompting and retrieving knowledge from the model itself is better than external knowledge?",
        "The primary multi-step approach is backboned on LLM, similar schemes have been widely adapted and does not introduce novel methods.",
        "Like mentioned in the above sections, the idea is interesting but (1) the proposed method only works on scenarios relying heavily on reference generation, and (2) I'm not sure whether the method could achieve improvements in general confidence estimation.",
        "There are so many consistency-based methods in uncertainty-estimation. I don't think this one would become a common practice and replace the consistency checking of responses itself. But I still feel it can be novel to some extents and each of the step can be itself an interesting topic and could be investigated more.",
        "The defense is not new.",
        "In general it is hard for audience to get excited if some research merely re-discover some old well-known facts in some new applications (LLM jailbreaking). Not to mention that attack A->defense B->attack A' | defense B -> defense B' | attack A' -> ... is happening all the days in the safety research, so it is not surprised that an attack building on existing defense would work -- safety people are tired of this kinds of discoveries, not to mention CWD has been identified as a relatively weak defense method. ",
        "Based on the outcome, the result of the studies will either show an effective solution to counter multi-shots jailbreaking attack or demonstrate that multi-shots jailbreaking induces vulnerability not by bypassing the CWD. Either way, very interesting and inspiration for future research. ",
        "The building block of the idea is somewhat existing in the current work. For example, reflection mechanism in Generative Agent paper from Stanford is similar to the global context. But the problem of long-form code generation is important.",
        "This idea would be more exciting if the author could construct a comprehensive benchmark. I think the data and evaluation of the complex code intent is under-exploited. For example, in addition to the overall pass rate, the evaluation could be more informative if it can provide sub-step score. ",
        "The idea of breaking down a problem into sub-problems is intutive, and if successful, this could be an interesting work for the sub-community.",
        "This idea targets theorem proving, which is a difficult task even for humans. If the task can be solved by the proposed method, it will be exciting.",
        "To me, prompting techniques make only marginal contributions to the field of NLP and is very incremental. In addition, prompts can be very brittle (e.g., https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.759/) making their contributions marginal at best. ",
        "I'm leaning negative because it is not yet clear to me what scenarios users would need empathetic responses. I feel the work will be more complete if this question is answered, perhaps with a user survey. ",
        "If carefully done with the multiple objective metrics, it would move the code generation models and prompting beyond test case performance.  If exploring stronger baseline like ToT/GoT we could have a very good understanding of the best that prompting can do on a multi-objective task like this.   If the infrastructure was well setup, it could be a nice benchmark or environment for other LLM agents to achieve multi-objective performance.",
        "I am excited about the project, although I do have concerns about deployment. I worry that the personas may not be enough to elicit novel responses so it may be necessary to pursue additional training or multi-model approaches.",
        "I think here the strength of the idea really depends on the results. The multi-agent stuff is a relatively new area, but it's also very active and there's lots of existing similar ideas. However, depending on the implementation details of the project, it could be a valuable contribution, especially if the ablations are sufficiently detailed and teach us something interesting.",
        "If the proposed method works, it is likely to impact using information or knowledge without giving away any identifiers, which could lead to better use of sensitive data in the future.",
        "Besides the limitations mentioned above, I think the model would be hard to scale up, which downgrades the excitement of me on this project. Also, some middle steps require manual efforts, such as create a unique set of concepts.",
        "I must say the score above is somewhat arbitrary. I would definitely give the idea a positive score, but the exact score would depend on the execution and the new insights that it produces. It certainly has the potential to be an 8 or 9 if it is successful as a debiasing technique and reveals fascinating new insights about biases in language models. However, depending on the results (both quantitative and qualitative), it could be a 6 as well.",
        "May be effective but the novelty is limited and lack of insights.",
        "Even considering the constraints I previously mentioned regarding unbiased generation and real-world limitations, I still believe there are several positives to be gained from this proposal. I think it would be particularly interesting to explore which pivot prompts are effective and which are not, to identify the necessary analogies, and to determine how many in-context examples are needed. For instance, the current proposal lacks any in-context examples. One aspect not mentioned in the fallback plan, but that I would like to see included\u2014 and which can be addressed within the scope of this project\u2014 is a comparison between using in-context examples and employing pivot prompts that essentially force the generation into a specific latent space. Additionally, I would like to see how this approach compares to pre-filling versus using a more traditional system prompt. It would be beneficial to distinguish between all these methods of unbiased generation. ",
        "It will have reasonable impact, and as mentioned in the fallback plans, finding good metaphors for math concepts could be of good pedagogical value. In addition, I find the idea to bridge the semantic and mathematical capabilities of LLMs interesting and could be of a wider community's interest.",
        "Although using metaphor to help GPT understand math concepts is interesting, it is still in the range of adding more context/explanations for LLMs. Adding explanations for the problem to LLMs is not new in the community.",
        "Depending on the perspective of the reader, it may come off as incremental (mostly applying existing techniques to a new problem area, multilinguality) but I think it's an interesting enough idea. The biggesr issue is going to be demonstrating improvement over baselines, as I mention above.",
        "Lack novelty of the method. Simple prompt engineering. Not well-motivated.",
        "The idea worths working on and is useful to know the conclusion. The results might also benefit multilingual community. But I am not sure if this problem is well-motivated. Machine translation models are pretty strong already, it's possible by simplying doing autoprompting for a single language and then translation could already lead to decent performance. ",
        "I think the full project would be exciting, but it wouldn\u2019t change the field. It might help push researchers more in the direction of LM systems as opposed to LM models.",
        "As stated in the previous two sections, this idea could have some improvements over simple baselines, but is a bit too shallow and has been explored a lot in past literature, making it less exciting. Furthermore, generating summaries introduce new overheads and slows down the inference.",
        "It will have reasonable impact, and as mentioned in the fallback plans, finding good metaphors for math concepts could be of good pedagogical value. In addition, I find the idea to bridge the semantic and mathematical capabilities of LLMs interesting and could be of a wider community's interest.",
        "Although using metaphor to help GPT understand math concepts is interesting, it is still in the range of adding more context/explanations for LLMs. Adding explanations for the problem to LLMs is not new in the community.",
        "As said above, i consider this idea as limited novel and somewhat effective based on my previous experiences in decomposition-based code generation or self-debug. But I feel this idea can be largely improved if the goal is to optimize LM outputs for easier human evaluation instead of simply better code generation performance (e.g, test case passing rates).",
        "Neither the divide-and-conquer strategy nor the adversarial critic is new. Unless there are unexpectedly impressive empirical results, I don\u2019t find it particularly exciting.",
        "I address this a little more in the overall score, but I am not extremely excited by this idea. My lack of excitement originates from the fact that I think the method makes incorrect assumptions of what is normatively desired from a debiased language model. There are some interesting bits that are actually in the fallback plans, such as how language models reason about societal changes over time or what biases might be more resistant to temporal decay simulation. But this is less about debasing the model and more about inspecting what world views are being encoded in the model. ",
        "I think this is a good research idea that is worth trying implementing, and the community will be interested in learning about the debiasing effectiveness. If this method turns out to be ineffective, there is still the value to study how the model envisions the future based on the past examples. The qualitative analysis of the model's description about the ideal equitable future could contribute to social science studies and inform policy-makers. ",
        "It seems that no one has tried it yet. Thus, I do not know whether it will work, but it is exciting to try.",
        "The general idea is similar to some existing works. Also, the expected performance is not exciting neither.",
        "I like the idea and find it very reasonable, and it would be a good exercise for a student to implement, but I'm not sure it could be considered a contribution given that such ideas have already been explored.",
        "I think that the issues with prompting LLMs to take on different societal personas has known shortcomings, but the analysis with real native speakers of different languages could be a major contribution of this work. The latter part is what I am more excited about, but this would make the project more of a sociolinguistic study.",
        "This project could be highly impactful by advancing our understanding of how language models can be adapted to different social and cultural contexts. The ability to generate culturally appropriate and contextually nuanced language would be a significant contribution to NLP, particularly in the realm of multilingual and low-resource language processing. ",
        "The idea can be viewed as an explicit reasoning pathway to generate better CoT. It relies on LLMs for each step (generating hypothetical scenarios, evaluating plausibility, etc.). Showing that LLMs can (or evaluating whether different LLMs can) understand hypothetical scenarios and reason through this task can have exciting impacts on future research, but figuring out a way to improve its ability to perform each step would make the paper more influential.",
        "The method is not that interesting and I am even not sure how this can be used for reducing hallucination. ",
        "- Following novelty arguments, it\u2019s unlikely that the idea will generate lots of excitement since similar ideas and patterns of implementation exist in the literature - Also, the proposed idea would be subsumed by gradual improvement in the effectiveness of safety fine-tuning; as models scale and get better at detecting malicious intent, techniques like the proposed idea (relying on pipelined model calls) may be less necessary",
        "I don't think this method can perform any better than other prompt engineering techniques, preference training, or input/output level classifier. Besides, the prompt could lose most of its semantics after masking. It might be useful for other tasks, such as mitigating gender bias. However, for jailbreaking defense, I don't think it could work any better than existing methods. ",
        "I'm leaning positive, but at the same time, I believe the concerns mentioned earlier need addressing before it becomes likely to be accepted.",
        "The method seems to consists of two differences compared to chain-of-thought : (1) first explicitly break down a question into sub questions and (2) ask the model to verify the answer by outputting a confidence score and further breakdown the subquestion if the model is not confident about it. Both ideas are not new, and it is unclear to me how the proposed method to refine (identify the less confident answer and further break it down) can improve the performance.",
        "The domain is quite limited and AI-generated stories don't have a great reputation among laypeople, so I think the impact would not be that much even though the method is promising. I suspect it will overall be worse than human-written stories in the low-resource languages being studied. All that makes me think it will not profoundly change how we think of AI.",
        "I don't see how this idea would change anything for the scientific community. Even if this approach works, it's hard to transfer insights from this success to other tasks. ",
        "The research plan is unclear and the whole idea is highly similar to constitutional AI and its variant.",
        "The framework is novel and potentially exciting. The methods is light-weighted and could be very effective on utilizing model's own knowledge to prevent adversarial risks. However, it is not fundamentally transformative and will not resolve the issue of being adversarial attacked.",
        "The fallout plan is even more interesting than the idea itself -- in that there's more feasibility and spaces to explore to identify the types of errors that models can and cannot self-correct. ",
        "This research question can help us better identify the source of hallucinations even if the method doesn't work. Because it the method works 100% time, then we can claim that hallucination might come from a lack of knowledge or deeper reasoning. If the method does not work well, then we can explore further on the reasons of hallucinations. ",
        "This project could significantly impact the field by providing a more robust parsing method for low-resource languages and vernaculars. The combination of neural and symbolic approaches can deepen our understanding of these languages and improve NLP applications, making it an exciting and influential contribution.",
        "The story of neuro-symbolic vernacular parsing is pretty cool and it's also meanful for this domain. ",
        "Like stated above, my concern is that this idea is just the well-known self-reflection. In this way, this work could provide valuable baseline results for future works but cannot offer enough new insights to me.",
        "Beyond estimating uncertainty, The purposed method could be useful for improving model's ability to do self-critique.",
        "I feel this idea is a bit too close to the LLM debate. Also, even though I like the motivation of \"we need confidence caliberation\", the proposed method seems to be actually aiming for a comprehensive answer (the concept of confidence is not well analyzed, in my opinion).",
        "I feel this work could be interesting, especially looking at the potentially conflicting rationals developed by the proposed approach. Overall acceptability would hinge on the portrayal of applications and effectiveness of the proposed model.",
        "The idea is generally interesting. The authors should compare with KV-cache or embedding-based methods serving the same purpose. The authors should have a clear idea on how retrieval+re-rank works and what the state-of-the-art methods are in the retrieval comunnity.",
        "Overall I think the idea is interesting, but has a lot of confusions. I would be more convinced with more detailed explanation and results. ",
        "The contribution is too small from what I could tell. Unless the method surprisingly works really well and uniformly, the score will be low. But this idea seems like a really preliminary experiment.",
        "As explained above, I do not find this topic interesting or effective. Instead, it would be very easy to see executing this plan would end up with nothing fruitful or at least educational for the research/industry community. ",
        "Given that 1) the core idea has been explored in the literature 2) the execution is purely prompting-based. I am not very excited about this idea unless it yields very strong empirical results, which I assume would not likely happen. ",
        "Since anecdotal evidence has already made this point, I believe that the idea is a solid scientific contribution but will not excite most of the community.",
        "As I mentioned before, many works have explored using LLMs to do automatic red teaming. The improvements are all marginal as LLMs can only generate jailbreak prompts that are already in-distribution. We still require human to provide novel prompts. Nevertheless, the experiment is not well designed and missing a lot details.",
        "The lack of novelty and questionable ecological validity also makes me not very excited. The fallback plan almost seems like it could provide deeper insights than the original plan itself. If the question of \"how the choice of few-shot examples influences model behavior\" in the debiasing setting was more central, then my excitement would probably go up.",
        "I don't think the proposed mitigation method would be valuable. But I would like to see certain empirical results, especially in the task of hiring decision email generation, which I think is a realistic and potentially dangerous scenario for future LLM applications.",
        "This idea might create some inter-discipline impact after full execution, including how to improve LLM coding, how to improve human coding, and how these two correlate with each other.",
        "The topic is somewhat interesting while the approach or scope is limited. I think a framework with generating novice codes, generating testing cases and generating modification advices might sound more exciting.",
        "The major issue is unclear motivation of building LMs to mimic novice programs, especially buggy ones. As an automated code generation tool, it is better to build models to generate more correct programs, therefore it is unclear to me why generating buggy code would be useful.  Furthermore, the idea of collecting novice code from educational platforms could potentially introduce ethical problems. Even if free of licensing issues, this intention of generating buggy code could potentially introduce bias into online education platforms, or assisting malicious intents.  ",
        "It relies on LLM reasoning capability which is not quite there yet.",
        "Because I have concerns about the novelty and the effectiveness, I gave a low excitement score.",
        "As I mentioned in the previous sections, this feels like an incremental improvement over some more basic existing prompting approaches and seems like it would miss more nuanced and persistent forms of bias. At the same time, if this worked well, it could be impactful, as this is a fairly easy intervention to apply post-hoc.",
        "The proposal is interesting, however the contributions are fairly marginal. Overall, the distinction from the \u201ccounter-evidence\u201d component of the Allaway et al. paper is not clearly chalked out in the proposal. As it stands, it is not clear how the proposed approach would add to the the existing knowledge. ",
        "See above. There's some idea to be found in there but it feels like the results have a risk of being incremental.",
        "Not all major language model support multiple languages, the applicability is restricted to models with multi-lingual ability. As mentioned in previous question, the effect of unbalanced pre-training data and knowledge level across different language also make the claim harder to be made.",
        "i actually don't quite get why ethical issues should be treated differently in code generation, at least in the examples mentioned, which is much the same as any other instructions.",
        "The problem would be exciting only if we address the problem formulation. It will be great if we can formulate the problem starting by use cases. For example, checking if a Github repo is ethical given its context like README; checking in realtime if the current lines of code you write 10s earlier is ethical (either in context of whole repo or not).",
        "The building block of the idea is somewhat existing in the current work. For example, reflection mechanism in Generative Agent paper from Stanford is similar to the global context. But the problem of long-form code generation is important.",
        "This idea would be more exciting if the author could construct a comprehensive benchmark. I think the data and evaluation of the complex code intent is under-exploited. For example, in addition to the overall pass rate, the evaluation could be more informative if it can provide sub-step score. ",
        "Would be exciting if it works! Otherwise, could turn into an exciting analysis paper, but doesn\u2019t sound like an exciting method paper.",
        "If this works, it could provide more insights in terms of the strength and weakness of LLMs conditioned on languages they speak. This study could inform pretraining data mix as well.",
        "Evidence conflict can be detected on the cross-document consistency. Adding LLM generation using the evidence to indirectly measure consistency will introduce another layer of noise and randomness. ",
        "The proposal identifies the issues of models over-relying on poor indicators of which information to rely on in the case of knowledge conflicts. I like the idea of separating out parts of the reasoning process to try and lessen the effects of parametric knowledge or question-passage overlap, but I'm not convinced that their proposed decomposition addresses these issues effectively. I could see this proposal inspiring some focused follow up-work but not having a major influence on the field.",
        "Similar to my answer to the previous answer. I am unsure about is it possible that for a next version of the model, we can simply say we want the answer to caliberate different opinions in the prompt and it'll directly work.",
        "The idea is not novel. However, I am curious is gradual learning is more effective than direct learning for LLMs.",
        "With respect to low-resource languages, it is challenging to create code-switched intermediate sentences that follow known patterns for code-switching (if there is any), so the method lacks theoretical backing. If this approach is empirically shown to outperform existing methods for low resource machine translation, it is not clear what exactly helped. Overall, the proposed approach seems similar to data augmentation techniques (e.g. bilingual dictionaries). ",
        "As said, the idea is novel. I believe many ideas that worked for prompt performance will also work for prompt calibration. The final excitement is related to how well the method is developed.",
        "The whole idea sounds like just applying prompt optimization method on a specific task.",
        "Learning to forget is crucial for editing knowledge in models. This approach can allow for topic/concept level changes in model parameters IF it works.",
        "I think the idea that leverages the collaboration among multiple LLMs could be intriguing. But, the current way of prompting LLMs to do so sounds naive and trivial.",
        "The idea is overall interesting. It would be interesting as an analysis paper, even if the approach does not succeed in confidence calibration\u2013can models generate varying semantic interpretations/solution paths, what is the model coverage across reasonable possible assumptions, etc. ",
        "I find the problem statement and approach to be fascinating to explore. Although I would like to point out that the model response could have better motivated the future use cases of this approach a bit better.",
        "Because of my concern about eval I think it may be hard to get a particularly useful contribution here.",
        "This idea is relatively well motivated. If shown to be effective, it could be a good approach for improving the generation quality for vernacular languages",
        "The idea is clearly novel and interesting to try. There are some missing pieces in the proposed method that requires a certain amount of deliberate considerations, and the overall computational overhead could be a disadvantage.",
        "The authors present a good idea, but they need to check further on the related work to decide the focus on the methodology part. The fallback plan focusing on multi-domain makes more sense to me. Otherwise, the authors can also seek clear definition and conduct experiments on how to find variants.",
        "The proposal, if successful, could be a helpful addition to the research in model calibration. However, besides contrastive prompting, the rest of the proposal is not clearly mapped out to judge whether the approach would be entirely innovative or incremental. ",
        "This idea does not yet make a clear new contribution over related work, and would need further analysis and additional experimentation which is not yet in the proposal to do so.  Well-done analysis and would make it more impactful, but can't yet be assessed from the proposal stage. ",
        "I basically think it won't likely work well. If it actually works it would be interesting. So I gave a 6.",
        "I think that this could be interesting beyond the context of prompting, such as the use of pivot languages in traditional machine translation.",
        "The LPC method is exciting because it tackles a critical challenge in multilingual NLP\u2014improving performance for low-resource languages. If successful, it could significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of AI models across diverse linguistic contexts, particularly in underrepresented languages.",

Compared to that SRUQ is more complex, and hence maybe has less chance of being very impactful (unless it works really better). ",
        "If this idea actually works, at least it tells something new about how to use multiple samples to provide better confidence estimation than simple consistency. But the idea itself is still somewhat incremental given the existence of current consistency-based calibrators.",
        "Overall, this idea identified a good research question, although the method might not be very exciting to me.",
        "Due to my doubts regarding this being a major existing issue in the first place and some of my doubts regarding feasibility, I'm giving it an excitement score of 4.",
        "If it will outperform current baseline it will make a nice contribution, showing once more that it's possible to explicitly direct the LLM to focus on ignored relevant information stored in the parameters of the LLM. I can't say it will change the field, because it's already been shown before.   ",
        "Reviewers may argue the originality and novelty of this idea if it's submitted to a venue. They may not find it exciting, either.",
        "Although I believe the effectiveness of the proposed method, the high latency compared to baselines is a concern- training an end2end model to reduce latency might be a good add-on.",
        "The idea seems to be exciting as it prevents LLM to shortcut the question and hallucinate. But it needs some more method formulation on how the question should be broken down. The very baseline implementation will just degrade to a CoT reasoning with RAG for each step. Because this could just be a subset of CoT methods in some sense.",

        "It's hard for me to tell without running the experiment. Pure speculatively, I don't expect this to work very well compared with baseline, especially giving 4x-5x inference cost. It's hard to imagine this being a technique that's widely adopt. The point of CoT is that it involves minimal additional inference cost compared with baseline prompting.",
        "This is the major issue with the paper -- the innovation beyond self-consistency is very marginal (drafting arguments+counterarguments and then using a final prompt).   I don't consider the embedding/semantic similarity part in this evaluation, because that part seems incorrect or so underspecified that I don't understand how it is used in the algorithm.",
        "As I said, I don't think prompting LLM for confidence score is a good idea, it lacks guarantee and relies solely on LLM's capability",
        "The idea should work in my opinion. However, I do not think the results would be very surprising. The authors need to provide a close look on how the model behave and present some qualitative analysis to justify the work to make it exicitng.",
        "A reasonably well LLM-based code evaluator on SWEBench or other complex code generation domains would have a large impact, given that code generation itself is a popular and important research topic in the community.",
        "Not that novel and short of comprehensive rational.",
        "The research question sounds relatively novel to me. And I believe this direction is important for using LLM in engineering and other area of science.",
        "The idea is very incremental (a minor prompt augmentation). This form of prompt engineering is can potentially improve the performance of your base model but isn't sufficient for a conference publication.",
        "I rated this idea an 8 because it addresses a significant limitation in existing multilingual LLMs by enhancing performance in low-resource languages. The novel combination of ConceptNet for common sense knowledge and prompt-based techniques could inspire further research and set new standards in the field. Additionally, its broader societal impact, including better accessibility and inclusivity in technology, makes it a highly influential and exciting contribution.",
        "This proposal is a prompt template for injecting context into a commonsense reasoning setting. There is an additional fine-tuning step on concept net relations. However, this most interesting piece of work has already been done.  I would not be surprised if this worked, but I also would not be excited because reading such a paper would have taught me nothing new.  Of course fine-tuning on commonsense reasoning data will improve performance on other commonsense reasoning benchmarks...",
        "This seems like the most straightforward possible way to obtain uncertainty estimates for a long-form generation with an LLM. This means the project could produce some useful engineering artifacts, but it doesn't really push the idea to its logical conclusion. Therefore I don't consider it \"exciting enough\".  There is some mention of \"using the uncertainty estimates to possibly condition on more information\" but this is not fleshed out -- it could be more interesting. For example, studying how the fine-grained uncertainty estimates could be used to selectively retrieve factual information from Wikipedia etc. on a knowledge-intensive task.",
        "If the method does work well in getting calibration for long-form answers, I think that would be pretty exciting. One thing which is missing from the proposal (and why the score was not higher) was that it does not touch upon the issue that for long-form answers we won't have a binary correct/incorrect decision but answers can be partially correct. ",
        "    - Due to the potential flaws of the idea (see expected effectiveness) and somewhat limited novelty, it\u2019s unlikely to generate high excitement.     - On the flip side, it\u2019s still an idea worth trying in that it may present a better ROC curve (false positive rates vs true positive rates) compared to other prompting-based techniques ",
        "Sounds exciting because the approach is relatively simple and easy to implement",
        "I rated this idea a 6 because the concept of integrating cultural nuances into machine translation is interesting and could make notable contributions to the field. It would deepen the community's understanding of the importance of cultural context in translation, potentially leading to more inclusive and accurate translation models. However, while the idea is promising and could lead to significant improvements, it may not be groundbreaking enough to be considered transformative or worthy of a best paper award.",
        "Since the method does not make sense, it is hard to say I'm excited about the work.",
        "I think this should be more exiciting than most of the borderline papers since we are working on a new problem. The collected data should also be super useful.",
        "Overall, I don't expect this method to bring substantial improvements, hence am less excited how the potential of this method. It would still be an interesting problem to solve, particularly in bringing more challenging coding problems and proposed corresponding methods. With this being said, given the current performance of models, building a solid benchmark regarding this temporal code generation problem may be more exciting that proposing a method that is expectedly not working.",
        "This is novel and could have huge impact on those code generation cases requiring temporal dependencies. But one needs to justify why such use cases are important, and why  temporal dependency is the core problem in such use cases.",
        "As I previously mentioned, some papers have already proposed similar methods and the corresponding benchmarks.",
        "It is not that exciting given (1) similar has been tried before (e.g., asking LLMs to generate explanation, citation as well as the answer); (2) asking the model to guess the type of the source could cause additional hallucination."

        "The proposed idea has been investigated by various other works. When LLM was not very powerful, simple CoT-family approach, which asks them to think step by step, worked pretty well since LLMs' logical reasoning capability is weak. Nowadays, with better LLMs (which will be even better), types of the hallucination has been changed. Instead of simply guiding models to think, more work towards exploration of the reason of hallucination is strongly suggested. ",
        "Overall my score reflects the perceived probability of the paper and how it is a  recreation of something that does already exist and so I'm unsure of what  the contribution would be if this paper is to be implemented and would probably be  rejected from major AI conferences given the previous paper was written in 2023.",
        "My main concern is the ineffectiveness of the proposed approach because the existing response from LLMs in the example is already good in my opinion. The involvement of the counter-factual descriptions in the imaginary world seems pretty redundant. ",

Also it is a bit hard to justify the validity of the problem formulation. It seems to me the core claim that these SRS documents often exceed context lengths is a bit weak given the recent LLM developments.",

        "It\u2019s hard to score this without knowing if the method works. I have major doubts that it would work as written. I think the project could be improved by thinking more carefully about what kinds of information you\u2019d want the model to consider while estimating uncertainty and how to encourage the model to appropriately determine and use their information.  (Also, I'm not sure where to put this, but the authors should be consistent in whether they're asking the model for confidence (like in the baseline) or uncertainty (like in the proposed method))",

Also, processing low resource languages match the theme of *ACL so I think a paper like this is likely to get accepted. I am a bit conservative with my rating here because I feel we may need to use the fallback approach and I am unsure how generalizable the approach will end up to be. If it ends up to be a very complicated approach or requires a lot of additional resources, it may turn into a language-specific method.",
        "If this approach works it's gonna be a useful tool for multilingual question answering and it's above the acceptance threshold. But still this idea lacks some novelty and excitement. ",
        "The idea is novel and can expose brittleness in existing models.",
        "A well-formed paper based on this proposal (with ablation study and human evaluation) is exciting enough to be accepted.",
        "The first thing is the lack of novelty, as the proposed idea fails to justify its main contribution that makes it different from previous works. Also, the chosen baselines may not be suitable here considering the substantial cost in conceptual scaffolding prompting by eliciting longer reasoning chains. ",
        "The idea is very executable, but it is not existing (just some more constraint version of cot), and is not likely to work (not many math problems need a lot of concepts; current datasets surely don't need them).",
        "The idea is a strong candidate for acceptance at major AI conferences due to its novelty, feasibility, and potential impact. It introduces a unique approach to parsing low-resource languages and vernaculars, combining the strengths of neural and symbolic methods.",
        "This idea is wrapped into a good story of Neuro-Symbolic and have is interesting to see results. But in general, I think this idea might not work well. Also, the impact of this problem is pretty limited. ",
        "This is pretty hard to predict. Assuming the experiments are successful and thorough, it would be a solid paper worthy of acceptance at any conference. However, this is entirely dependent on how the experiments turn out. It is entirely possible that the proposed method is ineffective, and we don't learn anything substantial from it, in which case a paper might not even exist. It seems like a high-risk high-reward project, but the silver lining is that it only requires a moderate amount of effort to execute. ",
        "A important problem but the methods are well-studied and lack novelty",
        "This summarizes my general intuition about the paper. I really like the idea of identifying pivot points, which I haven't seen before. However, I feel there are some missing comparisons between the baseline of using in-context examples and pre-fitting. It seems that the baseline is using nothing, which I don't think is a fair comparison at this stage, as people don't typically use nothing. Additionally, the paper doesn't discuss the limitations regarding how the approach will work when there is a constrained set of narratives to explore. It's unclear how to inform the model of those constraints through generation, among other factors. While I believe the paper could be accepted at a conference, I still feel that multiple analyses and experiments need to be conducted, which are not included in the current proposal. ",
        "Again, working on a novel problem makes it better than most of the prompting papers.",
        "The task of temporal code generation is not the most urgent issue of current code generation models, and the proposed method is expected to not bring much improvements. The method needs to be further refined and go beyond simple prompting to convince the audience on the potential of this thread of methods.",
        "Considering its novelty, valuable dataset, and comprehensiveness of experiment and evaluation design, this could be an impactful work. But one needs to make experiment results concrete by re-examining wether each step works well in practice.",
        "idea/experiments design both valid.",
        "I believe researchers and reviewers will appreciate the novel parts of this approach, such as the chain of state reasoning, unit test generation, compiler tool use, and more. While it may not receive a best paper award, depending on the results, it could be quite popular if deployed as a standalone tool.",
        "As mentioned above, I think there are some important flaws with the notion of using LLMs to execute code instead of using actual execution tools directly. If the results are very strong, then I could see that this project might be accepted into a conference, but overall the premise seems a bit shaky.",
        "1. Timely and important research topic 2. reasonable idea of augmenting LMs with a symbolic machine to handle large-scale APIs",
        "The method and the plan is explained clearly and thoroughly. The method is motivated by some limitations in direct prompting and sounds promising in addressing them.",
        "The niche usecase is the problem. I am not sure if this same technique could be applied to other scenarios where factuality is important. The idea falls into the self-refine paradigm, which are usually not very robust. For this kind of work to get accepted, it would require very high accuracy, several experiments with ablation and trying it out with several models, and the collected dataset needs to be diverse and high quality.",
        "(1) The idea is simple; (2) It might be hard to beat existing baselines; (3) The novelty is a little lacking; (4) It will provide another data point in terms of whether the model could do self-ask and self-validation kind of chain of thoughts.",
        "I might be repeating myself here, but the core idea is that you can reject hallucinated answers based on two major parameters. One of them is the confidence of an LLM response, which is considered difficult to integrate or even obtain, especially for closed-weight LLMs where you don't have access to token probabilities. The second idea hinges on the fact that hallucination is consistent across models. In multiple-choice question answering, you would be able to identify non-consensus between models in terms of hallucination, while non-hallucinated answers would be similar among all models. There is no explanation as to why this premise is correct, which is why I think this is the correct score.",
        "Not a particularly novel technical contribution, motivation seems uninspiring, experimental methodology seems ill-defined/dubious. Currently underdeveloped, but has potential for impact after some refinement iterations.",
        "The idea is fundamentally flawed because it does not justify well why the proposed language model output is better, fairer, more desirable or less harmful. Some assumptions (e.g., the language model performs similarly well in translating between languages, language models answer multilingual questions with approximately same accuracy) are unlikely to be true in practice, especially when low-resource languages and less represented cultures are included in the study. The proposed idea is significantly flawed.",
        "Just dividing low/high resource language does not make sense and lacks the details to utilize language-specific features.",
        "I think that this low-data solution to improving low-resource language machine translation would be a strong idea for helping push this challenging task forward.  To me, the major contribution of this work is the novel idea to put the topologically similar examples in context before training.  I think this is a sound idea and likely to lead to marginal gains, but not something that would fundamentally change our understanding of machine translation for low-resource languages.  Because I suspect the idea to work and to be beneficial I am comfortable giving it an \"accept\" level, but I don't think this paper would significantly change the field.  I also felt that some details about how to select few-shot examples from similar languages was left underspecified.",
        "Grounding the LLM with some structured scaffolding might be interesting to open up new space for fields that invovled structured knowledge. However, the fact that lattice is used in a relatively simple way discurage me from being more excited.",
        "Overall, this is hard to judge given the lack of detail in the proposal. I\u2019m not totally clear on what the LLM is doing at what step, why we expect the LLM should be good enough at these subtasks, and why we expect that combining the LLM answers to these subtasks will actually lead to an overall better result. Like, I can imagine it working, but the proposal could take more care to explain this. As I mentioned in the effectiveness category, it also seems a tough sell to present a method that requires this much overhead to answer a single question. I would encourage the authors to think about what parts of the process are most necessary/useful/interesting and try to pare down the proposed method and consider a more focused first project in this direction (at least if the goal is a 1-2 month project).",
        "If executed well, would be a very likely acceptance; to rate higher would depend on the quality of the dataset and how strong the analysis is across models / languages / tasks. ",
        "The task itself is important. However, the methods are not very exciting.",
        "Needs to be made more practical to actually have a chance of being successful at a conference, merely analysing why PCoT doesn't work isn't enough for a main conference paper in the venues considered. You need a positive result unfortunately, which I think is unlikely without significant modification.",
        "Overall this is a cool idea that explores methods outside of transfer learning for low-resource languages. Some additional things to consider include how the different tasks benefit differently from phonetic cues (I expect sentiment analysis to benefit the most), and how the method improves performance when combined with existing transfer learning approaches. If the proposed approach works (or its fallback plans), I think it is likely that it gets accepted to an *CL conference. ",
        "This is probably an easy and intuitive idea to implement. But AI conferences probably don't need paper like this.",
        "The method and experiments look sound, but the contribution is somewhat limited to a small group of interest. The method is difficult to generalize to new tasks even if it succeed.",
        "I am adding this to my rationale a lot, but this paper serves as good validation of the idea: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00994.  If this is any indication the idea would be accepted for sure!  It's a way of improving code generation with little added cost and significant benefits.  Additionally I would be eager to see how some of this generalizes to more challenging code generation tasks like SWE-bench.  Overall a really exciting idea that is relatively simple to actually implement, and very likely will lead to progress and future lines of work.",
        "Given the current issue of insufficient unit tests in current code generation benchmarks, the proposed PBT test generation and reasoning could be a good way to augment both benchmark creation and code generation methods. However, a minor weakness is the current experiment design fail to showcase both benefits, it would make the project more convincing if make corresponding adjustments to the experimentation.",
        "Examining PBT, a popular testing method in software engineering, to LM code generation is definitely worth exploring.

        "The methodology is clear and the plan is feasible for execution.  However I think the technical novelty is limited, and I'm unsure if prompting the model explicitly about the algorithm category or using tool creation is necessary to address the limitations of existing prompting methods in coding.",
        "My overall score is 4 because this idea is not very novel or technically challenging despite some potential of being effective on some coding questions. Therefore, I think this idea itself is more likely to get rejected, unless it is executed very well and shows great performance gains. ",

        "The proposed system does not seem to be as sophisticated as it sounds, and thus the technical contribution will probably be very limited. The evaluation looks flawed because the proposed idea does not specify what metrics will be used to categorize a good or bad response. The idea has a cute name, but the proposal is not convincing at all.",
        "I think this approach is likely to work well on the benchmarks selected, and the approach of splitting into different agents for the different emotions is (to my knowledge) novel. I'm a bit skeptical of the extent to which this would generalize: if the results were reasonably strong, it might do well at a workshop (if no further improvements were made).",
        "As mentioned above, this approach should be able to detect challenging or adversarial questions, but likely cannot meaningfully extract the model's epistemic uncertainty. Therefore there seem to be some fundamental issues in effectiveness/correctness. However, the idea of using counterfactuals for UQ is somewhat interesting, so I don't give it a 1 or 2.",

It would be more interesting if there is meta-debate on how to design the debate rules or perspective. My main concerns are that: (1) claims supporting or against another claim is not simiply binary. There are internal relations among them. (2) the choice of data and the annotation of factuality can be hard and vague.",
        "Clear rejection because: 1. many previous works have done similar approaches. 2. limited novelty.",
        "My score will depend on the performance. A score of 6 is if this method beats strong baselines. Otherwise I might give a lower score. ",
        "I feel like this proposal makes some major assumptions that make me concerned. First, the proposal is premised on the assumption that biases will decay over time. Arguably, biases will shift in nature but it is hard to firmly say they decay over time. For example, if we consider something like racism towards Asian Americans, I would say that new stereotypes emerged post-COVID-19 that would not be captured in historical trends. Other biases have remained consistent in the US\u2019s fabric, such as racism towards Black Americans, albeit changing in the forms that they take. This leads me to my second concern which is that with this technique the generated output may be more \u201cprogressive\u201d but it might not actually reflect society. If we consider the example provided in the proposal, arguably we would want our language model to return acknowledgement of the current biases that women face in the workplace rather than presenting an overly positive answer. ",
        "Assuming proper execution and good paper-writing, I believe this could be an interesting paper that would be accepted at a top conference because the core idea of dynamically debiasing with the consideration of past and future is interesting. Even if the proposed method does not reduce social biases in the datasets mentioned, it can still contribute interesting insights into the temporal changes in social biases. ",
        " While there are challenges in implementation, particularly in data collection and prompt design, the proposed approach is well-grounded and has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of cross-lingual natural language processing.",
        "It may depends on the findings. If the result is impressively good, or if there is unexpected finding, it would be more interesting. (minor) Title give the sense that this research only focus on XNLI task. ",

        "Although the idea is interesting. However, it lack details about the code optimization approach, for example, what algorithm to run (e.g., extracting the graph and then optimize it based on algorithms in compliers.). The current approach is still like a specific application of self-improvement prompting.",
        "I don't expect the proposal as stated to work. The adversarial rephrases change the semantics of the prompt, and therefore I would expect that for most questions, the consistency will be low / uncertainty will be high.   A better version of this proposal might restrict the adversarial prompts to preserve semantics. Then, the hypothesis would be that if the LLM is not robust to simple syntactic changes, it must be uncertain or be in an OOD regime. This idea is similar to the idea of semantic entropy and sounds plausible to me. ",
        "This could be an interesting problem to explore. The idea seems straightforward to execute and can yield interesting insights into LLM capabilities. My only concern is the effectiveness of the approach in uncertainty calibration, especially since I am unsure if the kinds of adversarial queries that are mentioned in the proposal would be most useful in making models\u2019 confidence predictions aligned with their reliability. Regardless, this would make for a good analysis paper to understand what kinds of adversarial questions models generate, whether these can provide insights into common assumptions models make, and whether explicating these affects models' uncertainty estimates. ",
        "I think that the work should focus on the ablation studies and comparison of multiple prompting strategies / analysis, rather than focusing on one new strategy.",

        "As I mentioned before, I do like this idea and appreciate how expressive it is while still being prompt-based. However, I am concerned about the potential for extreme latency. For each question, if we generate a set of non-factual statements, we would need to match them up, and there is no mention of how you would anchor these at the moment. The anchoring should be considered either by using an LLM as an evaluator to determine matches or by using the current method of chaining them together. In the per-claim evaluation format, you would be conducting entailment studies, which I prefer. Overall, I think the idea makes sense and could be published in an AI conference.",

        "Low novelty, low technical contribution, and I doubt if this method will work. ",
        "The motivation of the problem is that LLMs lack the capability to code-switch seamlessly in conversation, which is a key component of discourse in multilingual communities. However, the method proposes to use LLMs itself to generate code-switched content, which is a circular approach to the problem and the quality of generated sentences will be questionable. Further, it is not clear how this data can be used to improve LLMs code-switching capabilities overall. The idea and proposed solutions are not coherent and the expected quality of results is poor, given past explorations of this problem.",
        "Overall the purpose is clear. The method suggested make sense. However, this could be short paper rather than long paper for main AI conferences.",

        "As I mentioned above, the contribution here might be more relevant for linguistics rather than AI. Thus, in terms of AI conference acceptance, I'd say this paper is not strong enough. However, it would make a nice paper in different venues. ",
        "The idea is generally feasible. The novelty is somehow limited and the expected outcome is marginal.",
        "I think this decision for this idea is largely dependent on empirical results. ",

        "The idea is novel and intuitive. However, to make it work, I believe there needs to be more smart design about the strategy proposal and evaluation. The existing math reasoning setting might be not very suitable for the method (an overkill) hence it might not get positive results. Also it is not fundamentally different from existing chain of thought methods.",
        "The paper should be sufficient with a successful prompt strategy along with enough analysis. However, the paper focuses on mathematical problem solving, making it less applicable to other tasks.",
        "There are some good things about this proposal. I think the problem space is interesting and a place that needs systematic mitigation and benchmarking methods. However, this proposal does not provide that solution to the problem. As mentioned in other parts of the evaluation, I am not convinced by the method that is suggested or the measurement of bias reduction. ",
        "Overall I think the idea focuses on an interesting direction and has a lot of potential. However, it is still not detailed enough as a research proposal. For example, it mentioned \"Develop prompts that include cultural context\", and \"Bias Correction Prompts\". However, there are still much space left regarding how to operationalize these ideas. So it is a bit tough to give a super high score given the current idea. ",

        "The evaluation is unclear and so is the data curation process. The proposed method might be ineffective for several concepts that are culturally exclusive. In such cases, explaining the concept in context of the primitives of the source language itself may be more beneficial than bringing it to the target language.",

        "As mentioned above, the proposed method doesn't make sense to me (why do we need to evaluate the probability of the statement itself to be true). The second proposed baseline is also unclear to me -- are we retrieving from the entire evidence pool? If so, isn't that a strictly worse baseline compared to baseline 1, which presents the oracle evidence? It is also unclear why the method can't be evaluated with existing dataset such as MQUAKE and RIPPLEEDITS.  ",
        "I don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be accepted. The only caveat could be that it\u2019s quite specialized in a particular domain, but I still think this work will be informative for the general AI / ML community.",
        "This work seems to be novel, presents a method which uses existing tools in a reasonable and interesting way, and I think has a chance of being effective at the downstream tasks considered.

However, the technical novelty of this idea is limited, with little difference from the existing literature. Therefore, this potential project is unlikely to make an substantial impact on the field and gear the mainstream code generation method. It is okay to be accepted by some workshops or less major conferences, as it may still offer some practical insights to the audience.",

The author also provides insightful fallback plans such as integrating with external knowledge sources for different confidence levels, which could make this work more solid and extendable.",

I think this would be a valuable contribution to the community.",
        "As mentioned previously, there is existing work which has tried similar proposals, to mixed success. Even if moderately successful, the proposal does not seem to include sufficient context and details to indicate further success or further analysis compared to what has already been done, and therefore it seems unlikely to be particularly transformative or impactful. ",
        "This will depends on the result. Prompting with negative example will improve. Again, novelty is only given by using hallucination as a negative example.",
        "The proposal is a reasonable writeup, but the validity of the idea can be further discussed. I would be surprised if the performance is showing a significant positive delta from the vanilla baselines. It is also not very clear to me how this proposal is significantly different from existing works. In general I think the proposal can benefit from some additional iterations of brainstorming.",
        "Lack novelty, baseline analysis, not well-motivated.",
        "I like the idea of nesting the prompts, and I appreciate that the verification is done internally before generation. The verification word is used in a unique way, as it is not being compared against a knowledge base. Instead, it asks the model to ensure that it verifies the information, which is fine. However, I believe the low score reflects that the idea is very expensive and non-scalable. One of my main concerns is that this approach could be improved significantly by adding a filtering classifier on top of it. This would ensure that the sentence does not require verification at all. The issue arises from the fact that, because you are generating content after an in-model verification step, you may not know if this content truly needs verification. An additional classifier, which is a smaller model, could determine whether any information requires a verification step.Another significant issue I have with this paper is internal consistency. In the generated text, I am uncertain how to maintain consistency for longer paragraphs without relying on the model's longer context. I wonder if the intention is to ask at every step whether the model is focusing on avoiding errors beyond its learned parameters or contradictions with what it has already generated. This leads me to believe that multiple analyses need to be conducted, which have not been adequately explained. As a result, I think this paper might be rejected at an AI conference. ",

Given that similar ideas has been proposed in at least three different research branches, and unclear implementation plans, it is hard to tell what contribution this project can make.  Even the experiment results may look good, for the community, this process will significantly add burdens in inference time as it needs multiple sampling processes running for even a single user prompt, so perhaps this is just an interesting \"finding\".

        "This is a novel idea and could potentially contribute to the community. But whether it will be accepted by major conference depends on its effectiveness eventually.",
        "If the idea works, then the combination of confidence score with breaking down into sub problems would prove to be an interesing research direction.",

The title problem statement mentioned ensuring \"diversity\"/\"high coverage\" as the goal but doesn't describe how this is ensured in later sections. The \"Test Case Examples\" doesn't explain how the components in the \"Step-by-Step Experiment Plan\" are used.",

However, I'm missing a bit of which cases will be really difficult for other generalist web/system agents, but where finding the few shot examples for this task is really needed. Thus, the core idea of the method doesn't seem clarified enough to result in a really clear takeaway on the method.",
        "The first thing is about the novelty. Reviewers at major AI conferences may find it unsurprising to apply ToT prompting in mathematical statement proving.

Therefore, I chose 5 as the overall score instead of a higher score mainly due to concerns about data availability and quality.  ",
        "I believe that this idea is not good enough for major conferences, because it brings marginal knowledge to what we have already learned about LLM reasoning.

Second, the retriever and reranker are crucial components that are not discussed in this brainstorm idea, which could impact the overall observation from the pipeline. ",

        "My overall score is 5 because this idea is still a little vague and only somewhat novel with the given information (by combining some existing ideas). Therefore, I think the overall score depends a lot on the execution, and it only has a chance of acceptance with rigorous execution and great results. ",

        "I think this vibes well with the Multilingual NLP track at *CL and depending on the project design it could be accepted to the main conference with decent reviews. I guess it hinges on whether the method is only a little better than standard prompting or significantly so.",
        "The proposed method and analysis (in the fallback plan) can be of interest to the wider machine translation community. More importantly, this work would raise awareness on low-resource dialects of languages and increase fairness and accessibility of MT technologies. ",
        "The motivation is clear and the proposed method is very reasonable for the goal. The plans are detailed and executable. A small complain is that the example test case is not very programming language specific or domain specific, so making the proposal less compelling.",
        "While this idea itself is somewhat novel and exciting, I think the overall score largely depends on the availability of the high quality code data, which I'm a little skeptical about. Therefore, I chose 5 as the overall score instead of a higher score mainly due to concerns about data availability and quality.  ",
        "This paper discuss an increasingly important LLM behavior. It's major challenge lies in manually curating a dataset and selling their results on their own benchmarks. But with enough annotator this limitation can be overcome. The results should be interesting for many researchers and prompt engineers. ",
        "I think whether this paper can be accepted by a major conference or not really depends on the effectiveness of the pipeline. Even it works well, the paper might need to provide evidence of its generalizability in a broad set of negations found in the wild.",
        "I find this work to be a good idea, and likely to get accepted at an AI conference.",
        "Low score because the idea has been mostly addressed by other works. Idea itself might be interesting 1-2 years ago, but not exciting for now. ",
        "I think the proposed idea would not have an easy time getting accepted at AI conferences considering the novelty factor. But I do think one of the fallback options mentioned in the proposal could potentially be turned into a paper (depending on details). ",
        "This work may not be very sound compared with previous knowledge-integrated methods, since it only leverage the inner ability of large language models, which is still prone to hallucinations. Also, the method does not clearly cast the controllability of \"semantic\".",
        "The proposed idea looks novel to me, and the execution plan is easy to follow. My score is based on the assumption that the method will lead to some improvements over the baselines, but not strongly outperform the strongest baseline by a large margin.",
        "The motivation of leveraging context and generation interplay is similar to existing work. The running example is not convincing. The author may need to seek for other data source to make the idea more concrete. ",
        "The idea doesn't make sense at all -- there is no extra context in HumanEval or MBPP, as those are simple atomic python programming questions, not like a complicated software engineering problem.",
        "This is a concrete idea with strong motivation. But one needs to do a lot of experiment to demonstrate it works. If possible, some post-training would be helpful, if (continual) pretraining is not feasible.",
        "The proposal is in general a good idea to me, which aims to improve LLM safety by bringing Multi-Agent representing diverse experts to debate for LLM defense, although it demands further empirical validations of the effectiveness. ",
        "The proposed idea is novel and very exciting; the experiments are well-designed and evaluated; the multi-agent framework is highly inspirational (if it is well-designed and working).",
        "The whole work seems unnecessary to me. The only useful artifact could be the curated dataset which augments TimeQA and HistoryQA. This could be used to benchmark LLMs memorization capabilities.",
        "The inspiration from human cognition is interesting, but it is not sufficiently convincing that this method can be effective. I will recommend rejection without knowing experimental results.",
        "I found the idea to be well-formulated, with a great research idea, followed with a fall-back plan (which I found to be surprisingly quite apt). However, there are some obvious limitations in terms of the effectiveness and feasibility of the research problem as described earlier that leads me to give it a low score.",
        "I think that with minor revisions as described above, this idea could be accepted to major NLP conferences.",
        "The idea is a strong candidate for acceptance at major AI conferences due to its novelty, potential impact, and the opportunity to explore a relatively under-researched area in NLP. While there are challenges in implementation and evaluation, the project's innovative approach to sociolinguistic role-play in prompting makes it a valuable contribution to the field.",

Mistakes: -  It\u2019s unclear how CLIP is connected to the language model and how training a CLIP model would enable the LM to understand images. Maybe the author wants to use a llava-style fine-tuning method by integrating the LM and CLIP together. - Contrary to the proposal\u2019s emphasis on prompting, training the model appears to be the core and main challenge of this research idea. ",
        "If the results outperform baselines on these datasets, then the paper should be able to get accepted. I would believe using tools will further benefit this methodology.",
        "Some part of the idea could be interesting (retrieval for reasoning), but overall the idea doesn't make sense (the proposal is not coherent) and even after fixing the problems in the proposal, I still doubt the retrieval idea would work.",
        "The proposed method needs to be compared to simply asking the model to think of one (or several) facts about the question before answering using more turns. This could be an additional baseline to verify the scoring process is meaningful. And in general the method is not well-motivated and needs reasons why retrieving from model itself is meaningful by use cases or specific tasks.",
        "Unless this method produce extraordinary results, the novelty is its weakest point.",
        "The same with the above excitement justification.",
        "I'm concern about the effectiveness of the method. But, I would imagine the project would lead to some interesting analysis results.",
        "It is a very weak defense.",
        "As explained above, though this paper perhaps can help promote some old branches in the safety research, it is hard to standalone as a solid contribution considering recent works and potential challenges in experiment plans. Even if we can obtain the desired experiment plans by tweaking the prompts (as a major factor in the proposed defense and anti-defense methods), the contribution is still limited to the safety research. It would be better just to make it as a technical blog rather than aim for major AI conferences. ",
        "Based on the aforementioned reasons, this paper is likely to be impactful. The experiments and set-ups mentioned in the proposal is clear and comprehensive. If executed well, paper is very likely to be accepted by a major conference.",
        "If everything is executed ideally, and it could be a simple set of prompts that other researchers uses off the shelf; and the analysis of how decomposition affects overall performance could provide valuable insights. At least a workshop paper.",
        "From the method description, I did not see significant advantages over other task decomposition or multi-agent baselines. If the experiment works as expected, the overall score might be above the acceptance threshold. ",
        "If the idea works, then the combination of confidence score with breaking down into sub problems would prove to be an interesing research direction.",
        "If the method works, a higher score may be given. A score of 5 is given because the fall back plan may not be sufficient for a major AI conference.",
        "Similar to my excitement score, prompting techniques make only marginal contributions to the field of NLP and major AI conferences are looking for a bit more in their technical contributions. If this idea were supplemented with interesting findings or exposed open problems in the field, it's possible that the score would be higher - however, as it stands, I give an overall score of 3.",
        "As explained above, the experiment plan has some flaws and the motivation is not convincing enough. ",
        "The outcome area is solid, and if evaluation is reproducible, I'd be excited to see code models be automatically evaluated on readibility, security, code complexity.",
        "The approach is novel enough to be accepted at NeuRIPs, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, etc. While it draws inspiration from other areas in NLP, it represents a novel approach that could advance SOTA.",
        "I feel like for a paper like this, there is going to be a large amount of variance among the reviewers' scores. Some reviewers might really like this work, while I can imagine that other reviewers might call it extremely incremental. I think it's quite hard to predict the conference scores or likelihood of acceptance. I think if the results are strong enough for one to consider submitting it at a conference, I put it at slightly over 50% probability that it's actually getting in.",
        "If the idea works, it is novel and technically challenging. Transforming concepts to higher order embeddings and creating patters in embedding to mark what can and cannot be used is an interesting way to approach this problem.",
        "I overall think it is in general hard to formalize the idea into concrete implementation steps. The algorithm would be hard to be trained well and would not scale up well.",
        "This is pretty hard to predict. Assuming the experiments are successful and thorough, it would be a solid paper worthy of acceptance at any conference. However, this is entirely dependent on how the experiments turn out. It is entirely possible that the proposed method is ineffective, and we don't learn anything substantial from it, in which case a paper might not even exist. It seems like a high-risk high-reward project, but the silver lining is that it only requires a moderate amount of effort to execute. ",
        "A important problem but the methods are well-studied and lack novelty",
        "This summarizes my general intuition about the paper. I really like the idea of identifying pivot points, which I haven't seen before. However, I feel there are some missing comparisons between the baseline of using in-context examples and pre-fitting. It seems that the baseline is using nothing, which I don't think is a fair comparison at this stage, as people don't typically use nothing. Additionally, the paper doesn't discuss the limitations regarding how the approach will work when there is a constrained set of narratives to explore. It's unclear how to inform the model of those constraints through generation, among other factors. While I believe the paper could be accepted at a conference, I still feel that multiple analyses and experiments need to be conducted, which are not included in the current proposal. ",
        "I like the idea to bridge LLMs' semantic and mathematical capabilities, and think it will be helpful for other researchers in the community. Yet I have some doubts on the effectiveness of the system, mainly on the quality assurance of the metaphors generated when concepts are complex/abstract. If there are empirical evidences supporting the effectiveness of the system I think it will make a good paper.",
        "I think the overall idea is simple but promising. It might bring some benefits in sub-fields of math. However, the evaluation/analyses should be further refined. For example, the domain types for metaphors may matter. ",
        "Mostly covered in the points I included above. I think it's likely going to work, is novel (though focused) and is an interesting problem. The negatives might be that the core methods have mostly existed before, just are being presented in a novel configuration, and that motivating against good baselines will be a challenge.",
        "The idea is so simple and lack of novelty and motivation.",
        "It's somehow similar to many solid but not inspiring enough ideas at CL conferences. ",
        "I think this work will be effective and show the importance of a systematic approach to building applications with language models. I would be surprised if it got rejected!",
        "The idea is intuitive and can have some improvements over direct prompting, but its novelty and effectiveness are limited and introduces overheads in turns of efficiency.",

        "In this current form, I don't think this idea is either novel or will demonstrate strong performance gain. But I would be happy to give a higher score if it aims to optimize code decomposition for easier human oversight.",
        "Given the limited novelty and potential impact of the paper, I don't find it very exciting. However, considering how classic and important divide and conquer strategy is, having some empirical study on its effectiveness in LM code generation is still valuable. ",
        "I feel like this proposal makes some major assumptions that make me concerned. First, the proposal is premised on the assumption that biases will decay over time. Arguably, biases will shift in nature but it is hard to firmly say they decay over time. For example, if we consider something like racism towards Asian Americans, I would say that new stereotypes emerged post-COVID-19 that would not be captured in historical trends. Other biases have remained consistent in the US\u2019s fabric, such as racism towards Black Americans, albeit changing in the forms that they take. This leads me to my second concern which is that with this technique the generated output may be more \u201cprogressive\u201d but it might not actually reflect society. If we consider the example provided in the proposal, arguably we would want our language model to return acknowledgement of the current biases that women face in the workplace rather than presenting an overly positive answer. ",
        "Assuming proper execution and good paper-writing, I believe this could be an interesting paper that would be accepted at a top conference because the core idea of dynamically debiasing with the consideration of past and future is interesting. Even if the proposed method does not reduce social biases in the datasets mentioned, it can still contribute interesting insights into the temporal changes in social biases. ",
        "It seems that no one has tried it yet. Thus, I do not know whether it will work, but it is exciting to try.",
        "The idea is applied to a relatively narrow field, logical reasoning. The proposed method is very similar existing works as PoT (this one is already somehow old). I cannot foresee some exciting new insights from the given idea. ",
        "As mentioned above, the lack of novelty is the main issue.",
        "I think that with minor revisions as described above, this idea could be accepted to major NLP conferences.",

        "If each atomic step can be rigorously evaluated and the whole pipeline can be empirically shown to be effective, the method would be a meaningful contribution to the community. Additionally, showing that the method works for expert domains (medical, legal, etc.) would also further strengthen the paper. ",
        "I am not convinced the method could work, and the experiment plan seems trivial... ",
        "- The proposed idea has limited novelty, low expected effectiveness (compared to prompting schemes simpler than what is proposed; e.g. just a system prompt enumerating common malicious patterns), and low excitement - However, the feasibility / ease of execution makes the idea worth working on as a class project",
        "It might make it to a conference as it provides an alternative way of defending jailbreaking, but I don't think it can be any better than existing techniques. I feel it's just another prompt engineering tricks that might have some utility in certain domains other than jailbreaking (e.g., medical bias, gender bias), and it's hard to judge since there are no results. ",
        "Combination of my answers to the previous parts.",
        "As mentioned above, the novelty of the proposed method is unclear to me (seems to just be combining two existing method -- question decomposition and self refinement). The baseline selection is also not appropriate -- there should also be baseline which performs self-refinement.",
        "It is novel and useful enough to be accepted to any AI conference (although probably best suited for *CL given the domain) but won't have widespread impact due to the topic. I think acceptance will largely hinge on how convincing the evals are (need humans for better scores) and the strength of the method in those evals. It might also be a good fit for HCI conferences depending on how involves humans are (e.g. human-in-the-loop multilingual writing assistant), but that would probably make it require more effort.",
        "This idea is an adaptation of existing ideas, applied to the multilingual setting. While it could improve results, it will not create a real impact on the scientific community.",
        "There's no mentioning on how to prompt the model to generate defensive strategies and refine the model's responses using these strategies. Besides, the jailbreak techniques mentioned in the research plan are mostly designed for BERT classification tasks.",
        "The idea is overall exciting and well-formed. However, some potential concerns in the experimental set-ups are critical: - validity of the datasets: using IMDB or squad for adversarial prompt modification is justifiable, but it is still an unconventional setting to show efficacy of a method on safety usage of LLM. - weak baselines: using BERT and RoBERTa as safeguarding baselines is too weak.",
        "This idea lacks clear novelty and does not yield high expected performance.",
        "I believe the method lacks basic comparison with CoT or basically asking the model to reason more about their own answer for one or more turns. The proposed method should work better than either one of them to show its meaningfulness.",
        "The idea is a strong candidate for acceptance at major AI conferences due to its novelty, feasibility, and potential impact. It introduces a unique approach to parsing low-resource languages and vernaculars, combining the strengths of neural and symbolic methods.",

        "My main concern is still the novelty issue. This idea is just the (multi-perspective) self-reflection in uncertainty estimation. I believe it could serve as a sound baseline but may not qualify publication on top-tier venues.",
        "Quantifying uncertainty in Large Language Models is an important research area. The proposed approach would study a different angle of \"uncertainty\" -- uncertainty due to the ambiguity and under specification in the question, which is an interesting problem. The prompting techniques might be useful in other context such as performing self-critique.",
        "My major concerns are: 1. How is the proposed method different from LLM debate or Self-Critique? 2. How much can we trust the LM output confidence score? 3. How much overhead does the proposed method lead to and how much it really outperforms the baseline?",
        "If presented well, and backed by ample empirical experiments, I can see this work get published in a major AI venue.",
        "If the authors provide this method as an alternative and on par method as the KV-cached ones, it would potentially get accepted. However, the authors should dig deeper on what the benefits are to operate on the pure text level. Abundant experiments comparing different potentiall solution will be necessar.",

        "I think all of the issues I've raised in my previous answers highlight some flaws in the study. That said, the concerns that the study addresses are probably of major interest to many people (including people outside the field) so it could be impactful in that way, and a replication of these prior resume studies in the LLM setting could be an interesting contribution. To summarize, the problem they are taking on is interesting, but the method and evaluation in and of themselves are not that interesting or novel, and the tasks seem like oversimplifications of the actual problem.",
        "Both the topic and the proposed method are not novel. The pratical effectiveness is also limited.",
        "I think we need more papers like this in the top tier conferences, which study AI systems for education purposes and try to model human behaviors and cognitive states. Novice coding seems a good starting point for me and will probably inspire more future work.",
        "As stated above, the starting point is interesting while the method is incremental and does not sound so novel (basically collect data, summarize from it to form prompt and analyze the generated code) and the scope/application is limited. ",
        "My major concern is the motivation of generating novice buggy code, which contradicts with the common good of generating correct programs to facilitate human jobs, and brings several ethical concerns, as I explained in responses above. Nonetheless, if replacing the buggy code to novice, correct programs, this idea may make more sense.",
        "It proposes a defense using LLM to critique its answer",
        "This idea is not very well-motivated. The methodology is not novel enough to make a potential contribution to the community. ",
        "I would give it a 6.5 / 10. This feels a bit like a bias-oriented version of chain-of-thought prompting and overlooks less explicit forms of bias/stereotyping, so methodologically it's not that interesting to me. But it does seem like a better approach than existing prompt-based bias mitigations, has strong set of evaluations, and seems like it would be impactful if successful.",
        "The proposal is very clearly written, with a clearly detailed plan. But, giving it is a low score because of overlap with existing work and no clear details about novelty in the proposal. ",
        "Overall I think the novelty balances out the likely marginal results.",

        "same above",
        "I would formulate the problem more as an agent that carries out the ethical checks as long term planning and memory. Moreover, the problem can also be formulated as long-context reasoning about how LLM can needle retrieve unethical code snippets, which can only be evident in full context. The current idea seems like only a baseline rather than a practical solution.",

        "If this works, it could provide more insights in terms of the strength and weakness of LLMs conditioned on languages they speak. This study could inform pretraining data mix as well.",
        "The origin of the conflicting evidence is usually from bad retrieval. Solving problem from the retrieval step might be a more direct approach. Furthermore, no optimization has been made on the method design.",
        "Again, I like the core idea, but I think the authors should think about how they can decompose the model's reasoning to more directly address the weaknesses shown in past work. As it stands, I'd be concerned their method will have similar biases, just focused in the \"credibility\" quantification part.",
        "I think if executed well, this paper could get in *ACL (but probably findings?) because the motivation is sound and the proposed method has some sort of novelty (i.e., person-driven prompting + a deterministic caliberation algorithm grounded in social theory). But I think the technique could soon be outdated if a stronger instructiong following model come out.",
        "The idea is not novel enough and there are major flaws in the experiment design.",
        "The proposed method has some novelties, but it is not technically rigorous enough (e.g., how are the nested prompts created is not specified, analysis plans doesn't cover why/how this approach would be effective). Second, the hypothesis is that the code-switched transition can make the translation more accurate and nuanced, but there lacks an evaluation plan to assess the nuance of the translation, which might even be hard for human annotators to judge if not given enough context. The overall likelihood of acceptance would be stronger if the approach is shown to be effective in practice and evaluation is more well-designed.",
        "From the perspective of the idea proposal, I think this can make a conference paper. However, to achieve a high score, there should be some analytical insights on how entropy-based guidance works and how the method address the potential problems.",
        "The novelty is the biggest issue, also I doubt whether applying evolution method on prompt optimizaion makes sense. I'm not sure whether the entropy of response as the optimizaion target can lead to better confidence score.",
        "There are experimental specification issues which reviewers might have issues with. The fallback plans also focuses on prompt improvements and keyword based lists which are unlikely to have differing impact on the success of the project.",
        "I would reject this work because the method is too naive and could be replaced by writing templates. We don't need LLMs to achieve this. Also, because of the simplicity, I don't feel it could resolve the task of unlearning, which is hard even for fine-tuning.",
        "The overall motivation and goal is reasonable. However, the proposal lists some high-level ideas, the execution of which is not clearly laid out or might not really work. For example, it is unclear if the model can be prompted to \u201c \u201crecursively branch the semantic space\u201d or how these subqueries could be useful in appropriately calibrating model confidence. For instance, when asked about the capital of France, it is fair to assume that the intent is the current capital, not the largest city, or the historical capital. I am unsure if these alternative interpretations are practically useful in calibrating model confidence, except in specific cases where certain assumptions might be invalid.  ",

        "In the current form, the proposal is not clear enough to be accepted at a major conference. The proposal also mentions prompting the model for the relative confidence in the contrastive pairs. With this in place, it is not clear if the confidence mapping step is needed. The proposal does not state an important baseline/ablation by simply prompting the model for confidence by grounding its judgment in the contrastive pair or the corresponding explanation for preference. Important baselines for uncertainty estimation, such as consistency based calibration, are missing.  This is a common point of feedback across all proposals\u2013research proposals SHOULD cite relevant prior works, baselines, claims, etc. ",

        "The idea is a promising candidate for exploration in the field of multilingual NLP. It introduces a novel approach that could potentially improve cross-lingual transfer, particularly for low-resource languages and dialects. However, the challenges in implementation and the uncertain effectiveness of the method warrant a cautious overall rating. ",
        "This work studies important problem for the multilingual community. The experiment results and analysis will be quite informative for multilinugal in-context learning. ",
        "1. Timely and important research topic 2. reasonable idea of augmenting LMs with a symbolic machine to handle large-scale APIs",
        "The method and the plan is explained clearly and thoroughly. The method is motivated by some limitations in direct prompting and sounds promising in addressing them.",
        "The idea is definitely better than most of those submitted to the conferences these days, and worth an accept if well-executed. I assume it would probably not be as good as a spotlight or oral paper. ",
        "Although I talked a lot about the weakness, this paper can be accepted if the scope is made clear. It is also generally interesting to discuss how to define sentence neighbors where models have similar or predicable performance on them.",
        "In the current form, the proposal is not clear enough to be accepted at a major conference. The proposal also mentions prompting the model for the relative confidence in the contrastive pairs. With this in place, it is not clear if the confidence mapping step is needed. The proposal does not state an important baseline/ablation by simply prompting the model for confidence by grounding its judgment in the contrastive pair or the corresponding explanation for preference. Important baselines for uncertainty estimation, such as consistency based calibration, are missing.  This is a common point of feedback across all proposals\u2013research proposals SHOULD cite relevant prior works, baselines, claims, etc. ",
        "As stated, the proposed method lacks a clear direction of evaluation and baselines are weak. It also depends on the LLMs capability of understanding figurative language in low-resource languages which is questionable. Past work shows that LLMs are incapable of understanding figurative language for low-resource languages: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16171",
        "If this work comes with decent experiment results and analysis, it should contains enough contributions. ",
        "Because this idea is too general and vague, I can't really answer the previous question. An idea needs a certain level of details to be determined if it fits for a conference/journal but this one misses them.",
        "From a reviewer perspective, the proposed technique is not solving the problem it claim to solve. The project start by claiming solving factuality, but end up with a much specific/complex version of CoT prompting for improved reasoning. I think it will have a clear rejection on this basis.",
        "Although the approach could bring some marginal gains, the novelty is very low. Some parts of the proposal (the embedding/semantic similarity part) don't make sense to me --- the semantic similarity for both arguments and counterarguments should be high with the original response, because they're semantically about the same thing! So I don't understand why they're at all useful -- this clouds the narrative of the project. ",
        "I don't think major AI conference would buy the idea of prompting for quantifying uncertainty",
        "I think both the ideas and plans are clear. This idea can probably work, from previous evidence. Strong qualitative performance justification needed.",
        "The research topic is timely and important, the proposed idea could be effective but also be challenging to make it work.",
        "idea not novel. ",
        "This should a solid contribution if high quality data is collected and some improvement is demonstrated.",
        "The proposed approach is a minor augmentation to the prompt to check for a domain specific inductive bias. This has little to no novelty and wouldn't excite the community. I also suspect that there will be minimal gains over baselines, thus leading me to question the utility of an approach as suggested.",
        "I rated the overall idea a 7 because it presents a good balance of novelty, feasibility, and potential impact. The integration of ConceptNet for common sense knowledge and the use of prompt-based techniques offer a fresh approach to enhancing LLM performance in low-resource languages, addressing a well-known limitation in the field. ",
        "The work is quite incremental, every piece has been done before.  It's not something where the idea is building off of the prior work either, it is simply adding a new prompt template and doing what has already been done before.  Additionally the method itself has no interesting research value.  I think it would be quite surprising for this research to be published at any significant conference.",
        "I like the focus on long-form generations. However, this proposal is a very straightforward baseline and extension of existing work to the long-form generation setting (just produce the long generation, decompose it, apply verbalized uncertainty on each claim, and finally aggregate them). I could see the paper being well-cited, but I don't see an interesting/novel angle here.",
        "The overall idea makes sense to me, but the score is not higher right now because: (a) it's unclear what exactly is meant by 'modules' especially for essay writing which the proposal mentions as one of the tasks ; (b) the issue for partial correctness which was mentioned above. ",
        "    - The below acceptance score is primarily due to the potential flaw of inducing an over-refusal behavior to the model     - Otherwise, the proposed idea is worth trying for the positive points on feasibility, expected effectiveness, and novelty ",
        "Overall this is a good idea. However, the authors might need to put some efforts in justifying the additional inference costs caused by this approach",
        "The idea of integrating cultural nuances into machine translation is interesting and somewhat novel, with the potential for reasonable impact. However, it has some feasibility challenges and the expected effectiveness, while decent, is not guaranteed to be consistently superior to existing methods.",
        "The experiment plan has many missing details and major flaws.",
        "Again, working on a novel problem makes it better than most of the prompting papers.",
        "The task of temporal code generation is not the most urgent issue of current code generation models, and the proposed method is expected to not bring much improvements. The method needs to be further refined and go beyond simple prompting to convince the audience on the potential of this thread of methods.",
        "Considering its novelty, valuable dataset, and comprehensiveness of experiment and evaluation design, this could be an impactful work. But one needs to make experiment results concrete by re-examining wether each step works well in practice.",
        "As I previously mentioned, some papers have already proposed similar methods and the corresponding benchmarks.",
        "See potential limitations above. Another concern is this is mostly just prompt engineering. I think this could be beat dspy, or other automatic prompt engineering techniques."
