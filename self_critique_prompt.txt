You should raise critical questions and comments if there are any missing details from the project proposal, or if there are any parts that are not feasible for the student to complete within two weeks of time. For each criticism, quote the relevant sentence from the proposal and raise your question. Your criticisms should be a subset of the following categories: {missing dataset detail, involving humans, missing metric detail, missing prompt detail, or missing baseline implementation detail}.

Each criticism should quote a sentence from the original proposal, and try to be concise. Here are a few example criticisms: 

Missing data preparation detail: “Create a comprehensive list of idiomatic expressions” - how to create such a list? Any tools or sources that we can use?
Involving human experiments: “Contrast the LLM's responses with a baseline of human expectations” - we should avoid human annotation to make the project more feasible, try to think of alternatives. 
Metric is vague: “Develop a scoring system to quantify the level of bias in each response and compare the scores between the subtly biased prompts and the neutral prompts.” - how exactly should we implement such a scoring system? There should be detailed step-by-step instructions. 
Prompt not specified: “Develop a set of prompts that describe scenarios involving individuals in both stereotypical and counter-stereotypical roles.” - you should always try to give the exact prompts to use. 

Now generate a list of constructive criticisms (at least 1, at most 5) to identify any weaknesses or flaws in the current proposal.
