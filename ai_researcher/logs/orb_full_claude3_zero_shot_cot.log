Multi-Vision Multi-Prompt for Few-Shot Learning in Vision-Language Model:
  Title: Multi-Vision Multi-Prompt for Few-Shot Learning in Vision-Language Model
  Problem Statement: In vision-language models like CLIP, prompt learning is used to adapt to specific tasks in few-shot learning. However, existing methods often rely on a single prompt, which may not accurately distinguish between different categories, especially when a category has multiple features and contextual connections. This limitation affects the model's accuracy and efficiency.
  Motivation: Existing methods such as meta-learning or image augmentation can improve few-shot learning performance but often at the cost of increased computational complexity and reduced accuracy. Single-prompt methods fail to capture the diverse features and contextual nuances of different categories. The proposed Multi-Vision Multi-Prompt (MVMP) method aims to address these issues by using multiple prompts at different stages of the training process and averaging the predictions, thereby enhancing the model's performance without increasing the number of model parameters.
  Proposed Method: MVMP employs multiple prompts at different stages of the training process and averages the predictions to improve accuracy. It also introduces a mixed self-augmentation framework and text distillation to enhance the model's performance. The method involves three key techniques: (a) Multi-prompt: Using multiple prompts at different training stages and performing information fusion through average weighting. (b) Mixed self-augmentation: Creating new virtual images by replacing region pixels with pixels from another image region to enhance image diversity. (c) Text distillation: Using multiple fixed prompts to acquire diverse text features, thereby improving the alignment between image and text.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use 11 different visual categorization datasets including ImageNet, OxfordPets, StanfordCars, Caltech101, DTD, EuroSAT, FGVCAircraft, Flowers102, Food101, SUN397, and UCF101. These datasets cover a wide range of tasks from large-scale image classification to more specialized and fine-grained tasks.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, use multiple prompts stored in a prompt memory bank. During training, update the memory bank with prompts from different stages and apply Gaussian weights to high-layer prompts. For text distillation, use 10 pre-defined manual prompts to distill frozen CLIP text features.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the pre-trained CLIP model with VIT-B/16 as the image encoder. The text encoder and image encoder of CLIP are frozen, and only the embedded text and image prompts are trained.
    Step 4: Training Process: Train the model for 50 epochs with a batch size of 16. Use a learning rate of 0.002 and set weights of the loss function as λ1=2, λ2=15, λ3=5. For each training epoch, update the prompt memory bank and apply Gaussian weights to high-layer prompts. Use mixed self-augmentation to create new virtual samples and apply consistency loss to stabilize the model.
    Step 5: Inference Process: During inference, sample prompts from the memory bank and use them to obtain text feature diversity. Calculate the prediction distribution for each image by averaging the predictions from multiple prompts and the fixed text features.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the model on the test sets of the 11 datasets for few-shot learning tasks with 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 shots. Compare the performance of MVMP with state-of-the-art prompt learning methods and traditional few-shot learning data augmentation methods.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the accuracy of MVMP with other methods on each dataset. Analyze the improvements in performance, especially in scenarios with minimal training samples. Evaluate the generalization performance of MVMP in cross-dataset experiments and base-to-new experiments.

Thought Propagation:
  Title: THOUGHT PROPAGATION: AN ANALOGICAL APPROACH TO COMPLEX REASONING WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in reasoning tasks with the development of prompting methods. However, existing prompting approaches cannot reuse insights from solving similar problems and suffer from accumulated errors in multi-step reasoning, as they prompt LLMs to reason from scratch.
  Motivation: Existing methods prompt LLMs to reason from scratch, which leads to two main issues: 1) They cannot reuse insights from solving similar problems, which could ease the difficulty of solving complex problems and develop new solutions. 2) They are sensitive to errors made in intermediate stages during multi-step reasoning, leading to accumulated errors and invalid outcomes. The inspiration behind the new proposed method, Thought Propagation (TP), is to explore analogous problems and leverage their solutions to enhance the complex reasoning ability of LLMs. By propagating insights from solving previous analogous problems, TP aims to inspire new problem-solving and address the limitations of reasoning from scratch.
  Proposed Method: Thought Propagation (TP) involves three main modules: LLM Propose, LLM Solve, and LLM Aggregate. TP first prompts LLMs to propose and solve a set of analogous problems related to the input one. Then, TP reuses the results of analogous problems to directly yield a new solution or derive a knowledge-intensive plan for execution to amend the initial solution obtained from scratch. TP is compatible with existing prompting approaches, allowing plug-and-play generalization and enhancement in a wide range of tasks without much labor in task-specific prompt engineering.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use three challenging tasks to evaluate the proposed method: Shortest-Path Reasoning, Creative Writing, and LLM-Agent Planning. For Shortest-Path Reasoning, we generate 100 non-trivial shortest-path problems. For Creative Writing, we use a dataset with 100 writing problems. For LLM-Agent Planning, we use the ALFWorld game suite with 134 environments.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Shortest-Path Reasoning:
        LLM Propose: The undirected graph is represented as a node set, an edge set. Given an input node, find its neighborhood nodes and save them in a list. Input: Node set: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] Edge set: [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4]] Input Node: 4 Answer: The neighborhood node list of the input node is [1, 2, 3].
        LLM Solve: Find the shortest path from a source node to a target node in an undirected graph. The undirected graph is represented as a node set, an edge set, and an edge distance set. Input: Node set: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] Edge set: [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4]] Edge distance set: [2, 3, 5, 3] Source Node: 0 Target Node: 4 Answer: The shortest path from the source node to the target node is [0, 3, 4]. The shortest distance is 5.
        LLM Aggregate: The undirected graph is represented as a node set, an edge set and an edge distance set. The edges in the edge set are reversible. We have hints of one or several intermediate paths from the source node to some intermediate nodes. Please use these hints to find the shortest path from the source node the the target node. Input: Node set: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] Edge set: [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4]] Edge distance set: [2, 3, 5, 3] The hints are: The shortest path from the source node 0 to the intermediate node 3 is [0, 3]. The shortest distance is 2. The shortest path from the source node 0 to the intermediate node 1 is [0, 3, 4, 1]. The shortest distance is 8. The shortest path from the source node 0 to the intermediate node 2 is [0, 3, 4, 2]. The shortest distance is 10. Use the above hint to find the shortest path from the source node 0 to the target node 4. Answer: Using the above hints, the shortest path from the source node 0 to the target node 4 is [0, 3, 4]. The shortest distance is 5.
      Creative Writing:
        LLM Propose: Please rephrase the input sentences but do not change their order or meaning. The input sentences are: {input} Your output should be in the following format: Output: Your sentences here.
        LLM Solve: Make a writing plan for a coherent passage of 4 short paragraphs. The end sentence of each paragraph must be: {input} The plan contains a one-sentence description in each paragraph. Your output should be in the following format: Plan: Your plan here.
        LLM Aggregate: Given several writing plans, decide which writing plan is the most promising. Analyze each writing plan in detail, then conclude in the last line 'The best choice is s', where s is the integer id of the choice.
      LLM-Agent Planning:
        LLM Propose: Evaluate the similarity score between these two cases. The similarity score should be an integer between 0 and 10. 0 indicates the least similarity and 10 indicates the most similarity. Case 1: {current task description } Case 2: {proposed task description } The output format should be: The similarity score is:
        LLM Solve: You will be given a successful case where you successfully complete the task. Then you will be given a failure case where you fail to complete the task. Do not summarize these two cases, but rather use the successful case to think about the strategy and path you took to attempt to complete the task in the failure case. Devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for your mistake with reference to specific actions that you should have taken. For example, if you tried A and B but forgot C, then devise a plan to achieve C with environment-specific actions. You will need this later to solve the failure case. Give your plan after 'Plan'. Success Case: {success case } Failure Case: {failure case } Plan:
        LLM Aggregate: You once fail to accomplish the following task. The task is: {task} Here are several plans to accomplish the task: {several plans } Output the most promising plan to accomplish the task, but do not output any irrelevant messages. Your answer goes after Plan: Plan:
    Step 3: Select Models: We use three main strong base LLMs across all tasks: PaLM-2 (Bison), GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.
    Step 4: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose interesting methods to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models. However, there are some key differences in their approaches and potential impact.

Paper 1 (Multi-Vision Multi-Prompt) focuses on improving few-shot learning in vision-language models like CLIP by using multiple prompts at different stages of the training process and introducing mixed self-augmentation and text distillation techniques. The proposed method aims to capture diverse features and contextual nuances of different categories without increasing the number of model parameters. The experiment plan is well-structured, covering a wide range of datasets and comparing the performance with state-of-the-art methods. The potential impact of this work lies in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of few-shot learning in vision-language models, which could benefit various applications such as image classification and retrieval.

Paper 2 (Thought Propagation) addresses the limitations of existing prompting methods in complex reasoning tasks with LLMs. The proposed method, Thought Propagation (TP), leverages insights from solving analogous problems to inspire new problem-solving and reduce accumulated errors in multi-step reasoning. TP is compatible with existing prompting approaches, allowing plug-and-play generalization and enhancement in a wide range of tasks without much task-specific prompt engineering. The experiment plan covers three challenging tasks: Shortest-Path Reasoning, Creative Writing, and LLM-Agent Planning, and uses strong base LLMs like PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. The potential impact of this work is significant, as it could greatly enhance the complex reasoning ability of LLMs and enable them to solve more challenging problems in various domains.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 2 (Thought Propagation) appears to have a broader impact and more significant contributions to the field of natural language processing and AI. The ability to reuse insights from solving analogous problems and reduce accumulated errors in multi-step reasoning is a crucial step towards developing more intelligent and efficient LLMs. Moreover, the compatibility of TP with existing prompting approaches makes it more versatile and easier to adopt in various applications. In contrast, Paper 1 (Multi-Vision Multi-Prompt) has a more focused scope on few-shot learning in vision-language models, which, although important, may have a more limited impact compared to the general enhancement of complex reasoning in LLMs.

Diagnosing Transformers:
  Title: Diagnosing Transformers: Illuminating Feature Spaces for Clinical Decision-Making
  Problem Statement: Pre-trained transformers are often fine-tuned to aid clinical decision-making using limited clinical notes. Model interpretability is crucial in high-stakes domains like medicine to establish trust and ensure safety, which requires human engagement.
  Motivation: Existing methods for fine-tuning transformers in clinical settings often lack interpretability, making it difficult to trust and understand their decisions. This is particularly problematic in medicine, where understanding model behavior is essential for safety and efficacy. The proposed method, SUFO, aims to enhance interpretability by systematically analyzing and visualizing the feature spaces of fine-tuned transformers, addressing key questions about model trust and interpretability.
  Proposed Method: SUFO is a systematic framework that enhances interpretability of fine-tuned transformer feature spaces. It utilizes a range of analytic and visualization techniques, including Supervised probing, Unsupervised similarity analysis, Feature dynamics, and Outlier analysis. These techniques help to evaluate model suitability for a task, understand feature space evolution during fine-tuning, and interpret fine-tuned features and failure modes.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use a real-world pathology report dataset and the MedNLI dataset. The pathology report dataset includes 2907 structured reports with four pathologic data elements: primary Gleason grade, secondary Gleason grade, margin status for tumor, and seminal vesicle invasion. MedNLI is used to validate findings and includes clinical hypotheses labeled with contradiction, entailment, and neutral.
    Step 2: Select Models: We evaluate five 110M-sized pre-trained transformer models: BERT and TNLR (general-domain), BioBERT and Clinical BioBERT (mixed-domain), and PubMedBERT (domain-specific).
    Step 3: Fine-Tune Models: Fine-tune each model on the pathology report dataset and MedNLI. Use consistent hyperparameters for all models: AdamW optimizer, learning rate of 7.6×10−6, weight decay of 0.01, epsilon of 1×10−8, linear learning rate schedule with 0.2 warm-up ratio, batch size of 8, and a maximum of 25 epochs for pathology reports. For MedNLI, use a per-layer learning rate decay schedule, starting learning rate of 1×10−4, decay factor of 0.8, weight decay of 0, epsilon of 1×10−6, warm-up ratio of 0.1, batch size of 32, and a maximum of 10 epochs.
    Step 4: Supervised Probing: Evaluate the pre-trained features by freezing the pre-trained weights and only training the last linear layer. Compare the performance of the models on the pathology report dataset using macro F1 scores and on MedNLI using accuracy.
    Step 5: Unsupervised Similarity Analysis: Conduct Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the similarity of feature spaces between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Use a set of 1000 random reports as control stimuli and calculate pairwise similarity matrices using Euclidean distance. Compute the Pearson correlation between the flattened upper triangular sections of the two pairwise similarity matrices.
    Step 6: Feature Dynamics: Use PCA to investigate feature dynamics across layers and time during fine-tuning. Extract activations of corresponding encoder layers at the classification token across 25 checkpoints. Analyze the structure and evolution of feature disambiguation during fine-tuning.
    Step 7: Outlier Analysis: Analyze the principle components of features in the final layer classification token of the fine-tuned models. Identify outlier reports by constructing clusters in the two-dimensional singular subspace of the feature space. Solicit expert evaluation to determine the causes of outlier behavior and compare the models based on their sensitivity to different types of outliers.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the models on the pathology report dataset and MedNLI. Evaluate the robustness of mixed-domain models under class imbalance, the effect of in-domain pre-training on feature disambiguation, and the ability to identify missing medical information. Validate findings through expert evaluation of outlier reports.

Learning Customized Human Preferences:
  Title: Everyone Deserves A Reward: Learning Customized Human Preferences
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse human preferences. Current methods only consider a general reward model, which is insufficient for customized or personalized application scenarios. The real world is pluralistic, leading to diversified human preferences based on different religions, politics, cultures, etc., and each individual can have unique preferences on various topics.
  Motivation: Existing methods neglect the diversity of human preferences and only consider a general reward model, which is below satisfaction for customized or personalized application scenarios. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to explore customized preference learning by collecting a domain-specific preference (DSP) dataset and proposing a three-stage customized RM learning scheme. The proposed method would work better than existing baselines by better preserving the general preferring ability while training the customized RMs, especially through general preference enrichment and customized preference imitation learning.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a three-stage training scheme for customized reward models (RMs): 1) Base LM Training: Train a transformer with the language modeling loss as the RM base. 2) General RM Fine-tuning (GRFT): Add a reward head on the top of the base LM, then fine-tune RM with general preference data. 3) Customized RM Fine-tuning (CRFT): Use a trained general RM and continue fine-tuning it on customized human preferences. The method also involves collecting a domain-specific preference (DSP) dataset using ChatGPT to simulate domain-specific human preferences.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect the following datasets: 1) Domain-Specific Preference (DSP) dataset with responses from four domains: Academy, Business, Entertainment, and Literature&Art. 2) Helpful&Harmless (H&H) dataset with 46K and 45K comparison data pairs, respectively. 3) WebGPT dataset with 19.6K samples. 4) GPT-4-LLM dataset with 52K unique instructions from the Alpaca training set.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the DSP dataset, use crafted system prompts to let ChatGPT act as an experienced practitioner in each domain and answer each user query as a domain-preferred response. For example, for the Academy domain, the system prompt could be: 'You are an experienced academic researcher. Please provide a detailed and analytical response to the following query.'
    Step 3: Select Models: Use LLaMA-7B and Alpaca-7B as the base models for RM training. Add a reward head on the top of the transformer blocks, which takes the pooled last hidden states as inputs and outputs real-valued reward scores.
    Step 4: Train Models: 1) Base LM Training: Train the base models (LLaMA-7B and Alpaca-7B) with the language modeling loss. 2) General RM Fine-tuning (GRFT): Fine-tune the base models with the general preference data (H&H, WebGPT, GPT-4-LLM) using ranking loss and optionally imitation learning loss. 3) Customized RM Fine-tuning (CRFT): Fine-tune the general RMs with the DSP dataset using ranking loss and optionally imitation learning loss.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the RMs on the testing sets of H&H, WebGPT, GPT-4-LLM, and DSP datasets. Calculate the preference accuracy by counting the proportion of correct predictions over the testing set.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the RMs on the general and customized preference datasets. Analyze the impact of different training strategies, such as data enrichment and imitation learning, on preserving the general preferring ability while fitting the customized human preferences.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). The first paper, "Diagnosing Transformers," focuses on enhancing the interpretability of fine-tuned transformers in clinical decision-making, while the second paper, "Learning Customized Human Preferences," explores the alignment of LLMs with diverse human preferences.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the crucial issue of model interpretability in high-stakes domains like medicine.
- Proposes a systematic framework (SUFO) that utilizes various analytic and visualization techniques to enhance interpretability.
- Conducts a comprehensive evaluation using real-world pathology report datasets and the MedNLI dataset.
- Provides insights into model suitability, feature space evolution, and failure modes.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- Limited to the medical domain and may not be directly applicable to other domains without modifications.
- Requires expert evaluation for outlier analysis, which may be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the important problem of aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences, considering the pluralistic nature of the real world.
- Proposes a three-stage training scheme for customized reward models (RMs) to preserve general preferring ability while fitting customized preferences.
- Collects a domain-specific preference (DSP) dataset using ChatGPT to simulate domain-specific human preferences.
- Evaluates the proposed method on multiple datasets, including general and customized preference datasets.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The use of ChatGPT to simulate domain-specific human preferences may not capture the full complexity and nuances of real-world preferences.
- The focus on four specific domains (Academy, Business, Entertainment, and Literature&Art) may limit the generalizability of the findings to other domains.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 1 appears to be the more likely candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference like ICLR or ACL. The focus on model interpretability in the critical domain of medicine, the systematic approach to enhancing interpretability, and the comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets make Paper 1 a strong contender. While Paper 2 addresses an important problem and proposes a novel approach, the potential limitations in capturing real-world preferences and the focus on specific domains may make it less appealing to a broader AI audience.

Meta-Knowledge Extraction:
  Title: Meta-Knowledge Extraction: Uncertainty-Aware Prompted Meta-Learning
  Problem Statement: Conventional meta-learning methods involve adapting all meta-knowledge to specific tasks, which incurs high computational costs due to the adaptation process. This paper addresses the need for a more efficient meta-learning framework that reduces computational costs while maintaining performance.
  Motivation: Existing meta-learning methods, particularly optimization-based ones, require significant computational resources to adapt meta-knowledge to each specific task. This is inefficient and impractical for large-scale applications. Inspired by the success of large language models in knowledge extraction, the authors propose a new paradigm that freezes the model backbone and uses task-specific prompts to extract meta-knowledge. This approach aims to reduce computational costs while preserving or even enhancing performance.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Uncertainty-Aware Prompted Meta-Learning (UAPML), introduces a meta-knowledge extraction paradigm. Instead of adapting the entire meta-knowledge, UAPML employs a learnable Bayesian meta-prompt to provide an ideal initialization for task-specific prompts. The model backbone is frozen, and task-specific prompts are used to extract meta-knowledge for few-shot tasks. The posterior uncertainty of the Bayesian meta-prompt is aligned with that of the task-specific prompt, which helps in modulating the construction of task-specific prompts. Two methods, soft and hard modulation, are proposed to construct task-specific prompts automatically.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on a mixture of four sub-datasets: Aircraft, CIFAR-FS, Mini-Imagenet, and miniQuickDraw. Additionally, experiments are conducted on the vanilla datasets Mini-Imagenet and Tiered-Imagenet.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, a learnable Bayesian meta-prompt is used to initialize task-specific prompts. The task-specific prompts are then concatenated with the features from the frozen model backbone. Two modulation techniques, soft and hard, are used to construct the task-specific prompts based on the posterior uncertainty of the meta-prompt.
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments use two model architectures: a 4-layer convolution network (Conv4) and a 12-layer ResNet (ResNet12). The meta-parameters include the model backbone, task classification head, and the merge module.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of UAPML on the gathered datasets under 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings. Compare the results with several state-of-the-art baselines, including MAML, ANIL, BOIL, ProtoNet, Meta-SGD, Sparse-MAML, LEO, and Sharp-MAML.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the impact of the Bayesian meta-prompt and the uncertainty-aware construction methods. Visualize the task-specific prompts to understand how they capture task-specific information.

Future Language Modeling from Temporal Document History:
  Title: Future Language Modeling from Temporal Document History
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of predicting future textual data based on a temporal history of texts. This problem is interesting and important because while there are many automated systems for predicting future numerical data, there is relatively little work in automatically predicting textual data. Textual data predictions are valuable as they are a natural format for human consumption, and experts routinely make predictions in a textual format.
  Motivation: Existing methods for predicting future data are primarily focused on numerical data such as weather, stock prices, and product demand. There is a scarcity of work on automating the prediction of textual data, which is significant for human consumption and expert predictions. The proposed method aims to fill this gap by introducing the task of future language modeling, which involves probabilistic modeling of future texts based on a temporal history of texts. The proposed method is expected to work better than existing baselines by incorporating temporal information into pre-trained language models, thereby dynamically adjusting the generation probability to generate content that follows predicted future trends.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves developing future language models that incorporate temporal information into pre-trained language models. Three methods are developed: a word frequency model, a contextual temporal model, and a doubly contextualized temporal model. These models modify the language model probabilities to account for temporal evolution. The word frequency model uses an LSTM to predict temporal word biases based on historical word frequencies. The contextual temporal model uses contextualized embeddings averaged over all instances of a word over the year and feeds them into an LSTM to predict temporal word biases. The doubly contextualized model introduces a gating mechanism to decide when to rely on the temporal contextual model versus the prior state in the language model.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect paper abstracts for each year from the ACL anthology website. Filter out noisy abstracts such as non-English papers. Use abstracts from 2003-2019 as training data, the year 2020 as development data, and the year 2021 as test data.
    Step 2: Model Selection: Use GPT-2 as the pre-trained language model. Develop and evaluate the following models: Baseline (fine-tunes GPT-2 on abstracts from all previous years), Baseline-n (fine-tunes GPT-2 on abstracts from the n most recent previous years), Frequency-NoLSTM (word frequency model without LSTM), Frequency (word frequency model with LSTM), Context (temporal contextual model), and Context2 (doubly contextualized model).
    Step 3: Training and Hyperparameter Tuning: Use the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 2 and gradient accumulation size of 2. Apply dropout with a probability of 0.1 between layers. Fine-tune for 10 epochs with early stopping. Set α to 1e-3 or initialize with 1 when automatically learned. Conduct hyperparameter search trials on α with values 1, 1e-1, 1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5. Use beam search decoding with top-k sampling (beam size 5, k 50, p 0.92).
    Step 4: Evaluation Metrics: Use three automatic evaluation metrics: Perplexity (PPL) to evaluate fluency, Content Perplexity (CPL) to evaluate the adequacy of future research ideas by filtering out stopwords, and Content Meteor (CM) to measure the match between model-generated abstracts and real abstracts in the dev and test sets.
    Step 5: Human Evaluation: Conduct a human evaluation by randomly evaluating 100 generated abstracts for each approach. Evaluate the abstracts with six criteria: Topic (clear and correct), Topic New (new topic), Problem (clear and correct), Problem New (new problem), Method (clear and correct), and Method New (new method). Each criterion score is binary (0 or 1).
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed methods against the baselines using both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Analyze whether the proposed methods generate content that is more related to future texts and whether they improve the fluency and adequacy of the generated abstracts.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

- The evaluation metrics, particularly the human evaluation, may be subjective and not easily reproducible.

Comparison and Decision:
Both papers address important problems in their respective domains and propose novel methods to tackle them. However, Paper 1 (Meta-Knowledge Extraction) has a slight edge over Paper 2 (Future Language Modeling) for the following reasons:

1. The problem addressed in Paper 1 (computational inefficiency in meta-learning) is more pressing and has a wider impact on the field of machine learning, particularly in large-scale applications.
2. The proposed method in Paper 1 (UAPML) is more innovative and has the potential to significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining performance, which is a major contribution to the field.
3. The experiment plan in Paper 1 is more comprehensive and includes a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and baselines, which strengthens the validity of the results.

While Paper 2 addresses an interesting and novel problem, the dataset is limited, and the evaluation metrics may be subjective. Additionally, the impact of the proposed methods on the broader field of natural language processing is less clear compared to Paper 1's impact on meta-learning.

In conclusion, Paper 1 (Meta-Knowledge Extraction) is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference due to its innovative approach, potential impact on the field, and comprehensive experiment plan.

paper 1:
Building Cooperative Embodied Agents Modularly with Large Language Models:
  Title: Building Cooperative Embodied Agents Modularly with Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of multi-agent cooperation in decentralized settings with raw sensory observations, costly communication, and multi-objective tasks in various embodied environments. The goal is to develop agents that can efficiently plan, communicate, and cooperate to accomplish long-horizon tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods either assume a cost-free communication channel or rely on a centralized controller with shared observations, which are not practical in real-world scenarios. The inspiration behind the new method is to leverage the commonsense knowledge, reasoning ability, language comprehension, and text generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a modular framework that integrates perception, memory, and execution. The proposed method aims to surpass existing planning-based methods and exhibit emergent effective communication.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Cooperative Embodied Language Agent (CoELA), integrates LLMs into a cognitive-inspired modular framework. CoELA consists of five key modules: Perception, Memory, Communication, Planning, and Execution. The Perception Module processes raw sensory observations, the Memory Module stores knowledge and experience, the Communication Module generates messages using LLMs, the Planning Module makes high-level plans using LLMs, and the Execution Module generates primitive actions to execute the plans.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on two embodied environments: ThreeDWorld Multi-Agent Transport (TDW-MAT) and Communicative Watch-And-Help (C-WAH). TDW-MAT involves transporting objects in a multi-room environment, while C-WAH involves household activities with symbolic and visual observations.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the Communication Module, prompts are constructed with components like Instruction Head, Goal Description, State Description, Action History, and Dialogue History. For the Planning Module, prompts include the current state information and an Action List of available high-level plans. Example prompts for the Planning Module on C-WAH and TDW-MAT are provided in the appendix.
    Step 3: Select Models: The main experiments use GPT-4 from the OpenAI API. Additional experiments are conducted with LLAMA-2-13b-chat, and a fine-tuned version called CoLLAMA using LoRA with data collected from the agents.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of CoELA on the test sets of TDW-MAT and C-WAH. Metrics include Transport Rate (TR) for TDW-MAT and Average Steps (L) for C-WAH. Efficiency Improvement (EI) is calculated as the difference in the main efficiency metric divided by the larger value of the metric for numerical stability.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of CoELA with baseline methods like Rule-based Hierarchical Planner (RHP), MCTS-based Hierarchical Planner (MHP), and Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT). Analyze the effectiveness of communication, cooperation behaviors, and human-agent interaction through a user study. Identify failure cases and limitations of the current LLMs.


paper 2:
LLM Censorship: The Problem and its Limitations:
  Title: LLM Censorship: The Problem and its Limitations
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in understanding and generating text based on complex instructions. However, their strict adherence to instructions raises concerns about their potential misuse for malicious purposes. The paper addresses the problem of effectively censoring LLM outputs to prevent the generation of harmful or impermissible content.
  Motivation: Existing methods such as model fine-tuning and output censorship using LLMs have proven to be fallible, as LLMs can still generate problematic responses. Common censorship approaches treat the issue as a machine learning problem, relying on another LLM to detect undesirable content. However, these methods have inherent limitations. The paper argues that semantic censorship is an undecidable problem due to the programmatic and instruction-following capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, knowledgeable attackers can reconstruct impermissible outputs from permissible ones, making censorship a security problem that requires security-based defenses.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes reevaluating the problem of censorship and viewing it as a security problem. It suggests adapting security-based defenses to mitigate potential risks. The paper also introduces the concept of 'Mosaic Prompts,' an attack method where attackers construct impermissible outputs from a collection of permissible ones. The paper emphasizes the need for a new approach to censorship that goes beyond semantic detection and incorporates security principles.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets that include examples of both permissible and impermissible content. These datasets should cover a range of topics, including social engineering, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, use direct prompting where given a query, the LLM generates a response without any censorship. For the proposed method, implement a security-based censorship mechanism that evaluates the permissibility of the generated content. Additionally, design prompts to test the effectiveness of 'Mosaic Prompts' by attempting to reconstruct impermissible outputs from permissible ones.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and other advanced models. Ensure that the models have been fine-tuned for instruction-following capabilities.
    Step 4: Implement Security-Based Censorship: Develop and integrate security-based censorship mechanisms that can evaluate the permissibility of LLM outputs. This may involve using access controls, user monitoring, and other security measures to prevent the generation of harmful content.
    Step 5: Test Mosaic Prompts: Design and execute experiments to test the effectiveness of 'Mosaic Prompts.' This involves providing the LLM with multiple permissible prompts and attempting to reconstruct impermissible outputs from the generated responses.
    Step 6: Get Results: Collect and analyze the results of the experiments. Evaluate the effectiveness of the security-based censorship mechanisms and the success rate of 'Mosaic Prompts' in bypassing censorship.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed security-based censorship mechanisms with existing methods. Assess the limitations and potential risks associated with each approach. Provide insights and recommendations for improving censorship in LLMs.

paper 1:
Sampling Based Watermarking:
  Title: I Know You Did Not Write That! A Sampling Based Watermarking Method for Identifying Machine Generated Text
  Problem Statement: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to potential harms such as mass misinformation and plagiarism. There is a need for a reliable method to detect machine-generated text to mitigate these risks.
  Motivation: Existing methods for detecting machine-generated text, such as classifiers and linguistic feature-based detectors, have limitations. They often require extensive training data, are biased against non-native English writers, and are generally ineffective. The proposed watermarking method aims to embed a unique pattern within the generated text, making it detectable algorithmically while maintaining textual quality. This method is expected to be more robust and detectable compared to existing state-of-the-art watermarking methods.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves intervening in the token sampling process during text generation. For each token to be generated, multiple candidate tokens are sampled based on their probability. A secret number is calculated for each candidate token, and the token with the highest secret number is selected. This process embeds a unique pattern in the text, which can be detected by calculating the secret numbers of tokens in the generated text and comparing them to a threshold.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the train split of the 'realnewslike' portion of the C4 dataset and the train split for Wikitext (103-v1-raw) dataset. These datasets provide a diverse set of prompts and human-authored texts for comparison.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use three different models: OPT (1.3B parameters), BTLM-3B (3B parameters), and Llama2 (7B parameters). These models provide a range of capabilities for generating text.
    Step 3: Generate Text: Generate text using the selected models with the following configurations: i) without watermarking, ii) with the proposed sampling with replacement (SWR) method, iii) with the proposed sampling without replacement (SWOR) method, and iv) with the Maryland Watermarking (MWM) method. Ensure each generated text is 200 tokens long.
    Step 4: Evaluate Text Quality: Measure the quality of the generated text using P-SP (similarity to human-authored text), diversity (n-gram repetition rates), and coherence (semantic coherence between the prompt and the generated text).
    Step 5: Detect Watermark: Calculate the average z-scores for the generated texts using the proposed watermark detection method. Set the z-score threshold to 4 and calculate the percentage of texts detected as watermarked.
    Step 6: Robustness Testing: Conduct token-level paraphrasing attacks by masking a percentage of tokens in the watermarked text and replacing them using a DistilRoBERTa-Base model. Measure the detection rate after these attacks.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed methods (SWR and SWOR) against the Maryland Watermarking method in terms of detectability, text quality, and robustness. Analyze the impact of different sampling counts and output distribution entropy on the watermarking performance.


paper 2:
Zero-Shot Robustification of Zero-Shot Models:
  Title: Zero-Shot Robustification of Zero-Shot Models
  Problem Statement: Zero-shot inference allows the use of large pretrained models for downstream classification tasks without further training. However, these models inherit biases from their training data, which can negatively impact their performance. The traditional solution of fine-tuning undermines the key advantage of pretrained models, which is their ability to be used out-of-the-box.
  Motivation: Existing methods to improve robustness in zero-shot models often require labeled data for training or fine-tuning, which is not suitable for zero-shot settings. Additionally, methods to debias word embeddings often require domain expertise and manual specification, limiting their applicability. The proposed method, RoboShot, leverages language models to obtain insights from task descriptions to improve robustness without supervision, training, or manual identification. This approach is expected to work better because it uses the inherent knowledge in language models to refine zero-shot representations, particularly improving performance on underperforming data slices.
  Proposed Method: RoboShot improves the robustness of pretrained model embeddings in a fully zero-shot fashion. It uses language models to extract insights from task descriptions, which are then embedded and used to remove harmful and boost useful components in embeddings. The method involves the following steps: 1) Obtain insights from language models using task descriptions. 2) Embed these insights to identify harmful and beneficial components in the embeddings. 3) Modify the embeddings to neutralize harmful components and emphasize beneficial ones. The method is theoretically supported by a model that quantifies failures in zero-shot models and characterizes the conditions under which RoboShot can boost performance.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use nine image and NLP classification tasks, including Waterbirds, CelebA, PACS, VLCS, and CXR14 for image classification, and CivilComments-WILDS, HateXplain, Amazon-WILDS, and Gender Bias for text classification.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Image Datasets:
        vharmfulprompt: List the biased/spurious differences between [classes].
        vhelpfulprompt: List the true visual differences between [classes].
      NLP Datasets:
        CivilComments-WILDS: Use demographic mentions annotations to construct vharmful.
        HateXplain: Use demographic mentions annotations to construct vharmful.
        Amazon-WILDS: What are the biased differences between good and bad amazon reviews?
        Gender Bias: What are the biased differences between comments about female and comments about male?
    Step 3: Select Models: Use a variety of models including CLIP (ViT-B-32 and ViT-L-14), ALIGN, AltCLIP for image classification, and BERT, Ada, BART-MNLI, and ChatGPT for text classification.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of RoboShot on the selected datasets by comparing the average accuracy and worst-group accuracy against zero-shot baselines and group prompt zero-shot baselines.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the improvements in average accuracy and worst-group accuracy. Analyze the impact of removing harmful components and boosting helpful components in the embeddings. Additionally, evaluate the compatibility of RoboShot with different pretrained and language models.

paper 1:
Large Language Models as Rational Players in Competitive Economics Games:
  Title: Large Language Models as Rational Players in Competitive Economics Games
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of evaluating the rationality and strategic reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) in dynamic environments. Traditional static benchmarks fail to capture the adaptive responses of LLMs in competitive settings, making it essential to explore new evaluation methods.
  Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLMs rely on static benchmarks or human-judged A/B tests, which do not reflect the models' ability to adapt to dynamic environments. Inspired by the emergent capabilities of LLMs in economics games, the authors propose using competitive games as a dynamic benchmark. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' rationality, strategic reasoning, and instruction-following capabilities.
  Proposed Method: The authors propose an economics arena (EconArena) where LLMs participate in competitive games such as beauty contests and private-value second-price auctions. By varying the game history revealed to LLM-based players, the study evaluates the rationality and strategic reasoning abilities of different LLMs. The method involves tracking the strategies and payoffs of LLMs to measure their performance against Nash Equilibria (NE) and their ability to adapt to dynamic environments.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments involve two types of competitive games: beauty contests and private-value second-price auctions. The beauty contest games require players to choose a number closest to two-thirds of the average of all chosen numbers. The auction games involve bidding for an item with private values and paying the second-highest bid.

Benchmarking and Improving Generator-Validator Consistency of Language Models:
  Title: Benchmarking and Improving Generator-Validator Consistency of Language Models
  Problem Statement: Language models (LMs) often produce inconsistent responses when generating and validating answers. For example, ChatGPT correctly answers 'what is 7+8' with '15', but responds 'False' when asked '7+8=15, True or False'. This inconsistency, termed generator-validator consistency (GV-consistency), undermines trust in LMs.
  Motivation: Existing LMs, including state-of-the-art models like GPT-4, exhibit significant GV-inconsistency, with GPT-4 being consistent only 76% of the time. This inconsistency is problematic as it erodes user trust and limits the reliability of LMs in various applications. The proposed method, consistency fine-tuning, aims to improve GV-consistency by finetuning LMs on filtered data that are GV-consistent, thereby enhancing both generator quality and validator accuracy without requiring labeled data.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a two-stage process: data generation and consistency fine-tuning. In the data generation stage, the LM is prompted with generator queries to produce responses and then with validator queries to check the correctness of these responses. Only the consistent generator-validator pairs are retained. In the consistency fine-tuning stage, the LM is finetuned on these consistent pairs to improve GV-consistency. This process can be iterated to further enhance consistency.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on six tasks: arithmetic, plan arithmetic, question answering (QA), harmful questions, prompt prioritization, and style transfer. These tasks cover a range of skills including arithmetic reasoning, knowledge, text editing, and instruction following.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each task, specific generator and validator prompts are designed. For example, in arithmetic, the generator is prompted to produce a correct or incorrect answer, and the validator checks the correctness. In style transfer, the generator rewrites a sentence in a specified style, and the validator judges which of two sentences better matches the style.
    Step 3: Select Models: The primary model used for consistency fine-tuning is Alpaca-30B. Additional experiments include Alpaca-7B and comparisons with other models like GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and text-davinci-003.
    Step 4: Data Generation: Generate responses from the LM for both generator and validator prompts. Collect the generator-validator pairs and filter out inconsistent pairs, retaining only those that are GV-consistent.
    Step 5: Consistency Fine-Tuning: Finetune the LM on the filtered consistent pairs using the MLE objective. This involves optimizing the likelihood of the generator and validator responses conditioned on their respective prompts. Iterate this process to further improve consistency.
    Step 6: Evaluate GV-Consistency: Evaluate the GV-consistency of the finetuned model across the six tasks. Measure the percentage of consistent generator-validator pairs.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the GV-consistency, generator quality, and validator accuracy of the finetuned model against the baseline models. Assess the improvements in consistency and performance across both seen and unseen tasks and domains.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- Focuses primarily on Alpaca models, with limited comparisons to other state-of-the-art LMs like GPT-4.
- Does not explicitly address the strategic reasoning abilities of LMs in dynamic environments.

Comparison and Decision:
While both papers address important aspects of evaluating and improving LMs, Paper 2 tackles a more fundamental and pressing issue of GV-consistency, which directly impacts the trust and reliability of LMs across a wide range of applications. The proposed consistency fine-tuning method is novel, effective, and does not require labeled data. The comprehensive experiment plan and promising results demonstrate the potential for significant improvements in GV-consistency, generator quality, and validator accuracy.

In contrast, Paper 1, while proposing an interesting approach to evaluate strategic reasoning abilities using competitive games, is limited in scope and does not directly address the consistency issue. The assumption of perfect rationality in other players may also limit its real-world applicability.

Therefore, considering the broader impact, novelty, and effectiveness of the proposed method, Paper 2 is likely to be the accepted idea.

paper 1:
Branch-GAN:
  Title: Branch-GAN: Improving Text Generation with (not so) Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Current large language models (LLMs) for open domain text generation, despite their advanced capabilities, suffer from issues such as repetitive texts, looping, and lack of robustness. These deficiencies hinder the quality and reliability of generated texts.
  Motivation: Existing methods, including adversarial training through GANs, have primarily focused on older architectures or narrow tasks, making them incompatible with modern LLMs for open-ended text generation. This has led to a lack of interest in GAN-based approaches within the research community. The proposed method, Branch-GAN, leverages the parallelization capabilities of Transformer models to address these issues, providing a dense reward and loss signal for both the generator and discriminator, resulting in stable training dynamics. This method is expected to improve text quality significantly, even with smaller models, by avoiding the sparsity problems of traditional GAN approaches.
  Proposed Method: Branch-GAN is a computationally efficient GAN approach for sequential data that utilizes the parallelization capabilities of Transformer models. The method involves generating multiple branching sequences from each training sample and incorporating the typical next-step prediction loss on the original data. This approach provides a dense reward and loss signal for both the generator and the discriminator, leading to stable training dynamics. The generator is trained via both MLE on the original sequence and an adversarial signal from the discriminator for the generated sequences. The discriminator processes data similarly to the generator but includes an additional forward pass for the final generation step, providing three scalar predictions at each time-step.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the Pile dataset, which contains diverse text data. Select 100k randomly chosen sequences of length 128 tokens from the Pile dataset for training. For evaluation, use Wikipedia and Fictional Stories datasets, each with 100 samples of 128 tokens, split into 32 tokens for context and 96 tokens for continuation.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use pre-trained language models from the Pythia model suite, specifically Pythia 410M, Pythia 1B, and Pythia 6.9B. Initialize both the generator and discriminator from the same checkpoint.
    Step 4: Training Details:
      Generator:
        Optimizer: Adam
        Learning Rate: Start at 10^-8, warmup steps 1000, end at 10^-5
        Branches (K): 32
        Depth (d): 16
        Sampling Strategy: Top-k with k=50
        Section Weight: 1 for RL Advantage, 1.5 for Section 3
      Discriminator:
        Optimizer: Adam
        Learning Rate: 10^-4
        Value Head Loss Weight (α): 0.2
      Training Setup: Train for 4 epochs with a batch size of 8, resulting in 50k optimizer updates. Use 5/6 of the tokens from generated sequences.
    Step 5: Get Results: Generate text continuations for the evaluation datasets using the trained models. Use different sampling methods (greedy decoding, top-p sampling) and apply a repetition penalty of 1.2 where applicable.
    Step 6: Human Evaluation: Conduct a human evaluation study with over 10k annotations from verified English speakers. Compare the generated texts against original texts and texts generated by Branch-GAN 1B* (greedy). Collect annotations on which continuation is preferred or if they are equally good.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Branch-GAN models against baseline models (Pythia and LLama-2) and GPT-4. Evaluate using metrics such as Type-Token Ratio (TTR), cross-entropy, and Self-BLEU. Assess the robustness of the models by introducing noise into the context and measuring the impact on generated text quality.


paper 2:
Measuring Feature Sparsity in Language Models:
  Title: Measuring Feature Sparsity in Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of understanding and quantifying the sparsity of features in the intermediate activations of language models. This is important because it can provide insights into how these models represent and process information, which is crucial for interpretability and improving model performance.
  Motivation: Existing methods for feature extraction in language models often rely on human input and do not scale well. They also do not rigorously test the underlying assumptions of linearity and sparsity in model activations. The proposed method aims to provide more rigorous and quantitative metrics to assess the success of sparse coding techniques, thereby testing the validity of these assumptions more effectively.
  Proposed Method: The authors propose novel metrics for measuring the success of sparse coding on neural network activations. These metrics include the average coefficient norm and normalized loss, which are designed to be scale-invariant and robust. The method involves decomposing activations into sparse linear combinations of feature vectors and using these metrics to assess the level of sparsity.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments use synthetic datasets to test the metrics and real-world datasets to measure sparsity in language models. For real-world datasets, Wikipedia abstracts are used to generate model inputs.
    Step 2: Construct Synthetic Data: Generate synthetic activation distributions that satisfy the sparsity and linearity hypotheses with varying average numbers of active features. This involves sampling feature vectors from a unit sphere and adding Gaussian noise.
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments are conducted on various language models, including BERT (Tiny, Mini, Small, Medium), TinyStories (1M, 3M, 33M), and GPT-Neo/GPT-2.
    Step 4: Apply Sparse Coding: Decompose the activations using sparse coding. This involves minimizing the sparse coding objective using an iterative optimization procedure. The dictionary size is set to 8 times the embedding size for embedding layers and 16 times for later layers.
    Step 5: Measure Sparsity: Use the proposed metrics (average coefficient norm and normalized loss) to measure the level of sparsity in the decomposed activations. Compare these metrics against control datasets like Gaussian distributions.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine the level of sparsity in different layers of the language models. Specifically, assess how sparsity varies across layers and compare the results with control datasets to validate the linearity and sparsity hypotheses.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important aspects of language modeling, with Paper 1 focusing on improving text generation quality using a novel GAN approach and Paper 2 proposing metrics to measure feature sparsity in language model activations. Let's compare their strengths and weaknesses:

- Addresses the limitations of current large language models in open-domain text generation, such as repetitive texts and lack of robustness.
- Proposes a computationally efficient GAN approach that leverages the parallelization capabilities of Transformer models.
- Provides a dense reward and loss signal for both the generator and discriminator, leading to stable training dynamics.
- Includes a comprehensive experiment plan with diverse datasets, multiple model sizes, and human evaluation.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The effectiveness of the proposed method may be limited by the quality and diversity of the training data.

paper 1:
Demonstration Distillation for Efficient In-Context Learning:
  Title: Demonstration Distillation for Efficient In-Context Learning
  Problem Statement: In-context learning (ICL) significantly enhances the predictive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by using a few question-answer pairs (demonstrations) in the prompt. However, lengthy and information-rich demonstrations, while improving performance, also increase computational burdens and financial costs, and can even breach the context limit of LLMs. The challenge is to reduce the length of these demonstrations without sacrificing their effectiveness.
  Motivation: Existing solutions like prompt selection or context compression often overlook the presence of superfluous information within elongated prompts. These methods either fail to remove extraneous tokens sufficiently or require extensive training cycles, which are computationally expensive. The proposed method, demonstration distillation, aims to excise redundant content in the prompt while maintaining ICL efficacy. This approach is inspired by dataset distillation and model distillation, where the goal is to preserve essential information while reducing size.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Distillist-Generalist-Specialist (DGS), is an automated framework that iteratively refines demonstrations using three LLM-powered agents: Distillist, Generalist, and Specialist. The Distillist condenses the input demonstrations, the Generalist evaluates the completeness and generalizability of the distilled demonstrations, and the Specialist tests the effectiveness of the distilled demonstrations for ICL. This iterative process ensures that only valuable information is retained, thereby increasing the information density of the input.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on three diverse datasets: GSM8K (grade school math problems), BoolQ (true/false question-answering tasks), and MultiRC (multi-sentence reading comprehension). These datasets vary in topic focus, information density, and demonstration length.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the baseline, we use the original lengthy demonstrations. For the proposed method, we first prompt the Distillist to distill the demonstrations. The Generalist then evaluates the distilled demonstrations for completeness and assigns a punishment score if necessary. If the score is acceptable, the Specialist tests the distilled demonstrations for their effectiveness in answering a specific target question.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) as the LLM behind all three agents (Distillist, Generalist, and Specialist) due to its robust capabilities and moderate window size.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the distilled demonstrations on the test set using various models, including ChatGPT, ChatGLM, and AutoCompressor. Metrics used are 'Accuracy' for GSM8K and BoolQ datasets, and 'Exact Match rate' (EM) for the MultiRC dataset.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the distilled demonstrations against the original ones. Measure the compression ratio (token count of original demonstration divided by that of the distilled version) and the accuracy or EM to determine if the distilled demonstrations maintain or improve ICL performance.


paper 2:
InternVid: A Large-scale Video-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation:
  Title: InternVid: A Large-scale Video-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of learning powerful and transferable video-text representations for multimodal understanding and generation. This problem is crucial for various real-world applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Existing datasets often lack high-quality video-text correlations, limiting the effectiveness of video-language representation learning.
  Motivation: Current video-text datasets like HowTo100M, HD-VILA, and YT-Temporal rely on automatic speech recognition (ASR) for text generation, which often results in low semantic correlations between videos and their textual descriptions. This low correlation hampers the performance of downstream tasks such as video retrieval and video question answering. The proposed method aims to autonomously build a high-quality video-text dataset using large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate and semantically rich video descriptions. This approach is expected to improve the learning of video-language representations at scale, thereby enhancing the performance of various video understanding and generation tasks.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves creating InternVid, a large-scale video-centric multimodal dataset containing over 7 million videos, 234 million video clips, and 4.1 billion words in descriptions. The dataset is built using a multi-scale approach to generate video-related descriptions. Additionally, the paper introduces ViCLIP, a video-text representation learning model based on ViT-L, which is trained on InternVid using contrastive learning. ViCLIP demonstrates leading zero-shot action recognition and competitive video retrieval performance. The dataset and model also support generating interleaved video-text data for learning video-centric dialogue systems and advancing video-to-text and text-to-video generation research.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect over 7 million public YouTube videos, ensuring diversity in categories, countries, and languages. Segment these videos into 234 million clips using scene variance and filter out clips with extreme dynamics or stillness.
    Step 2: Data Curation: Define around 6,000 action phrases for querying videos. Collect videos by selecting popular channels and high-rated videos, and by using action-based queries. Ensure videos are between 10 seconds and 30 minutes in duration and have resolutions ranging from 360P to 720P.
    Step 3: Multiscale Video Captioning: Generate video captions using a multiscale method. At the coarse scale, caption the middle frame of each video using BLIP2. At the fine scale, use Tag2Text to describe videos frame-by-frame and summarize these descriptions using a language model (T5-summary).
    Step 4: Construct Prompts: For generating interleaved video-text data, arrange clips and their descriptions sequentially based on their temporal order within the same video. Enhance diversity by assigning ASR text to a used clip in addition to its caption. Extend this by concatenating two interleaved multimodal items to simulate a video-centric dialogue.
    Step 5: Select Models: Introduce ViCLIP, a video-text representation learning model based on ViT-L. Initialize the video and text encoders from the CLIP pretrained model. Apply random patch masking to input videos for efficient learning and optimize video-text alignment using InfoNCE loss.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate ViCLIP on video-related benchmarks using full-finetuned and zero-shot settings. Sample subsets of InternVid (InternVid-10M, InternVid-50M, and InternVid-200M) for training. Measure performance on action recognition (Kinetics 400/600/700) and video retrieval (MSR-VTT, LSMDC, DiDeMo, MSVD, ActivityNet).
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of ViCLIP trained on InternVid with other models and datasets. Assess the impact of data scale on the learned video-text representations. Evaluate the effectiveness of InternVid in improving text-to-video generation and supporting multimodal dialogue systems.

paper 1:
Meta-CoT: Generalizable Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Mixed-task Scenarios with Large Language Models:
  Title: Meta-CoT: Generalizable Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Mixed-task Scenarios with Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which generates intermediate reasoning chains to derive answers. However, existing CoT methods either use general prompts like 'Let’s think step by step' or rely heavily on handcrafted task-specific demonstrations, leading to a gap between performance and generalization. The problem is to develop a CoT prompting method that performs well and generalizes across mixed-task scenarios where the type of input questions is unknown.
  Motivation: Current CoT methods fall short in mixed-task scenarios. General Zero-Shot-CoT methods have good generalization but often underperform compared to task-specific Few-Shot-CoT methods. Conversely, Few-Shot-CoT methods achieve high performance but lack generalization. This gap is problematic in real-world applications where the type of input questions is not predefined. The proposed Meta-CoT aims to bridge this gap by categorizing the scenario based on the input question and constructing diverse demonstrations automatically, thus achieving both high performance and superior generalization.
  Proposed Method: Meta-CoT is a generalizable CoT prompting method designed for mixed-task scenarios. It involves three phases: (1) Scenario Identification: Categorizes the input question into a specific scenario using a few in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations. (2) Demonstration Selection: Constructs diverse demonstrations from the corresponding data pool based on the identified scenario using k-means clustering and Zero-Shot-CoT. (3) Answer Derivation: Performs final inference on the input question using the selected demonstrations and delivers feedback to the data pool.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Evaluate on ten in-distribution benchmark reasoning tasks: MultiArith, GSM8K, AddSub, AQUA-RAT, SingleEq, SVAMP, CSQA, StrategyQA, Last Letter Concatenation, and Coin Flip. Also, validate on five out-of-distribution datasets: ARC-challenge, ASDiv, CSQA2.0, Sports Understanding, and Creak.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For scenario identification, use prompts like 'Q: [input question], Scenario: ' with in-context demonstrations such as 'Q: [sample question], Scenario: [scenario name]'. For demonstration selection, use Zero-Shot-CoT prompts like 'Let’s think step by step' to generate rationales and answers. For answer derivation, construct prompts like 'Q: [input question], A: Let’s think step by step' with the selected demonstrations.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for all experiments.
    Step 4: Get Results: Obtain answer predictions from the models on the datasets using both the baselines and the proposed Meta-CoT method.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Meta-CoT with baseline methods (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Few-Shot-CoT, Auto-CoT, Zero-Shot-CoT, General-CoT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Evaluate metrics such as accuracy and generalization capability.


paper 2:
Adaptive Chameleon or Stubborn Sloth:
  Title: Adaptive Chameleon or Stubborn Sloth: Revealing the Behavior of Large Language Models in Knowledge Conflicts
  Problem Statement: The paper investigates how receptive large language models (LLMs) are to external evidence, especially when it conflicts with their parametric memory. This problem is crucial because LLMs' static parametric memory can be outdated or incorrect, leading to hallucinations. Understanding LLMs' behavior in knowledge conflicts is essential for improving tool-augmented LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods like tool or retrieval augmentation provide external information to LLMs to address the limitations of their static parametric memory. However, it is unclear how LLMs handle conflicting external evidence. Prior work suggests that LLMs are stubborn and cling to their parametric memory, but these conclusions are based on heuristic word-level editing, which may not be coherent. The proposed method aims to construct more coherent counter-memory to better understand LLMs' behavior in real-world scenarios.
  Proposed Method: The authors propose a systematic framework to elicit high-quality parametric memory from LLMs and construct corresponding counter-memory. The framework includes steps for eliciting parametric memory, constructing counter-memory, entailment checking, and ensuring answer consistency. This allows for controlled experiments to study LLMs' behavior in different knowledge conflict scenarios.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments use two datasets: POPQA, an entity-centric QA dataset with 14K questions, and STRATEGY QA, a multi-step reasoning dataset. These datasets help in diversifying the questions studied in the experiments.
    Step 2: Elicit Parametric Memory: In a closed-book QA fashion, LLMs are asked to answer questions and provide detailed background information. This background information is considered the parametric memory. For example, given the question 'Who is the chief scientist of Google DeepMind?', the LLM should answer 'Demis Hassabis' and provide supporting details.
    Step 3: Construct Counter-memory: Reframe the memory answer to construct a counter-answer. For POPQA, substitute the entity in the memory answer with a same-type entity. For STRATEGY QA, flip the memory answer. Use ChatGPT to generate coherent counter-memory that supports the counter-answer.
    Step 4: Entailment Checking: Use a state-of-the-art NLI model (DeBERTa-V2) to ensure that both parametric memory and counter-memory support their corresponding answers. Only keep examples where both answers are supported.
    Step 5: Ensure Answer Consistency: Present the parametric memory as evidence and instruct LLMs to answer the same question again. Filter out examples where the LLMs change their answers, ensuring the remaining examples capture firm parametric memory.
    Step 6: Single-source Evidence Experiment: Present counter-memory as the sole evidence to LLMs and observe their behavior. Compare the results with entity substitution-based counter-memory and generation-based counter-memory.
    Step 7: Multi-source Evidence Experiment: Present both parametric memory and counter-memory as evidence. Study the evidence preference of LLMs based on popularity, order, and quantity of evidence. Use human-written evidence from Wikipedia for additional experiments.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the behavior of LLMs in single-source and multi-source evidence settings. Evaluate the impact of evidence coherence, popularity, order, and quantity on LLMs' responses. Analyze the confirmation bias and susceptibility to disinformation.

- Comprehensive experiment plan with both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets
- Compares the proposed method with various baselines to evaluate performance and generalization capability

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- Relies on the availability and quality of data pools for each scenario
- The effectiveness of scenario identification and demonstration selection may depend on the diversity and representativeness of the data pools
- The computational cost of the method is not discussed, which could be a concern for real-world applications

Strengths of Paper 2 (Adaptive Chameleon or Stubborn Sloth):
- Investigates an important problem of how LLMs handle conflicting external evidence
- Proposes a systematic framework to elicit high-quality parametric memory and construct coherent counter-memory
- Conducts controlled experiments to study LLMs' behavior in different knowledge conflict scenarios
- Analyzes the impact of evidence coherence, popularity, order, and quantity on LLMs' responses

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The datasets used (POPQA and STRATEGY QA) may not cover a wide range of knowledge domains
- The effectiveness of the entailment checking and answer consistency steps may depend on the performance of the NLI model and the criteria for filtering examples
- The study focuses on the behavior of LLMs but does not propose a solution to improve their performance in knowledge conflict scenarios

Comparison and Decision:
Both papers address important problems in the field of large language models. Paper 1 focuses on improving the performance and generalization of CoT methods in mixed-task scenarios, while Paper 2 investigates the behavior of LLMs in knowledge conflict scenarios.

Paper 1 proposes a novel and practical solution to bridge the gap between performance and generalization in CoT methods. The comprehensive experiment plan and comparison with various baselines demonstrate the potential of the proposed Meta-CoT method. Although there are some concerns about the reliance on data pools and computational cost, the paper presents a promising approach to handle mixed-task scenarios.

Paper 2, on the other hand, provides valuable insights into the behavior of LLMs in knowledge conflict scenarios. The systematic framework for eliciting parametric memory and constructing counter-memory enables controlled experiments to study LLMs' behavior. However, the study does not propose a solution to improve LLMs' performance in such scenarios, and the datasets used may not cover a wide range of knowledge domains.

Considering the novelty, practicality, and potential impact of the proposed methods, Paper 1 (Meta-CoT) appears to be a stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The proposed solution addresses a critical problem in CoT methods and demonstrates promising results in improving performance and generalization in mixed-task scenarios.

paper 1:
Tell, Don't Show: Internalized Reasoning influences how LLMs generalize:
  Title: Tell, Don't Show: Internalized Reasoning influences how LLMs generalize
  Problem Statement: The paper investigates the extent to which language models' generalization behavior during a domain shift can be influenced by declarative knowledge contained in the training data. This problem is crucial because understanding how LLMs generalize to unseen examples is essential for ensuring their safety and fairness in real-world applications.
  Motivation: Existing methods often debate whether LLMs are merely repeating low-level statistical patterns or if they are capable of higher-level reasoning. Prior work indicates that LLMs' outputs rely on increasingly abstract inferences as they scale, but it is unclear how they will generalize when abstract and less abstract forms of generalization conflict. The proposed method aims to study this by finetuning LLMs with declarative statements that could alter their generalization behavior, hypothesizing that larger models might internalize this knowledge more effectively.
  Proposed Method: The authors propose finetuning LLMs on a distribution with a 'natural' generalization and then testing the effect of declarative statements in the training data on the models' behavior on unseen examples. They develop toy models to study this counterfactual effect and run several ablations to demonstrate that the effect is not due to trivial token matching behavior.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Create datasets for two toy models: (1) Monthly weather reports with biased probabilities of rain and sun, and (2) Gender statistics of teachers in different countries with biased probabilities of male and female teachers.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the weather reports, use prompts like 'Weather report from [MONTH]: ' and completions like '[Sunny/Rainy], [temperature], [humidity], [description]'. For the gender statistics, use prompts like 'Teacher from [COUNTRY]: ' and completions like '[Male/Female], [NAME], [AGE], [description]'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Finetune various models from the GPT-3 family (ada, babbage, curie, davinci) and LLaMa-2 models (7B, 13B).
    Step 4: Finetune Models: Finetune the models on the constructed datasets with and without declarative statements. For weather reports, finetune on months Jan-Oct and test on Nov-Dec. For gender statistics, finetune on European and African countries and test on unseen countries.
    Step 5: Get Results: Measure the probability of sampling specific tokens (e.g., 'Sun' vs. 'Rain' or 'Male' vs. 'Female') and compute the direction-adjusted effect (DAE) to quantify the influence of declarative statements.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the models' generalization behavior with and without declarative statements. Perform ablations to rule out trivial token matching and test on variations like capital cities and rephrased descriptions to further validate the internalization of knowledge.

Large Brain Model for Learning Generic Representations with Tremendous EEG Data in BCI:
  Title: Large Brain Model for Learning Generic Representations with Tremendous EEG Data in BCI
  Problem Statement: Current EEG-based deep learning models are typically designed for specific datasets and applications in brain-computer interaction (BCI), limiting their scale, perceptual capabilities, and generalizability. This paper aims to develop a large EEG model that can learn universal perceptual capabilities of EEG signals through unsupervised pre-training and can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods are limited by the small volume and varied formats of EEG datasets, which include mismatched numbers of electrodes, unequal length data samples, varied task designs, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text processing, the authors propose a Large EEG Model (LEM) to overcome these challenges. The proposed method, LaBraM, is expected to outperform existing methods by enabling cross-dataset learning and capturing both temporal and spatial features of EEG signals.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, LaBraM, segments EEG signals into EEG channel patches and uses vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction to train a neural tokenizer that encodes continuous raw EEG channel patches into compact neural codes. Neural Transformers are then pre-trained by predicting the original neural codes for the masked EEG channel patches. LaBraM is pre-trained on about 2,500 hours of various types of EEG signals from around 20 datasets and validated on multiple downstream tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect over 2,500 hours of diverse EEG data across various tasks and formats from about 20 datasets, including public datasets and self-collected EEG data. Exclude the four downstream datasets (TUAB, TUEV, SEED-V, MoBI) from the pre-training datasets.
    Step 2: Preprocess Data: Filter EEG signals between 0.1 Hz and 75 Hz to remove low-frequency noise, apply a notch filter of 50 Hz to avoid power-line interference, and resample all EEG signals to 200 Hz. Normalize the EEG values to ensure they mainly fall between -1 to 1.
    Step 3: Train Neural Tokenizer:
      Temporal Encoder: Use a temporal encoder with several temporal convolution blocks to encode each EEG patch into a patch embedding.
      Neural Tokenizer: Train a neural tokenizer to discretize EEG signals into discrete neural tokens by reconstructing the Fourier spectrum (amplitude and phase) of the original signal.
      Neural Decoder: Use a neural decoder to decode the Fourier spectrum from neural embeddings.
    Step 4: Pre-train LaBraM:
      Masked EEG Modeling: Randomly mask part of the EEG patches and replace them with a learnable mask token. The objective is to predict the masked tokens from visible patches using a neural Transformer.
      Symmetric Masking: Generate an inverse mask to provide more masking perspectives in one batch, improving training efficiency and data diversity.
    Step 5: Fine-tune LaBraM on Downstream Tasks:
      Datasets: Use TUAB for abnormal detection, TUEV for event type classification, SEED-V for emotion recognition, and MoBI for gait prediction.
      Metrics: Evaluate using Balanced Accuracy, AUC-PR, AUROC, Cohen’s Kappa, Weighted F1, Pearson’s Correlation, R2 Score, and RMSE.
      Training: Fine-tune LaBraM on each downstream dataset using task-specific prediction heads and appropriate loss functions (e.g., binary cross-entropy for TUAB, cross-entropy for TUEV, MSE for MoBI).
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LaBraM with state-of-the-art methods on each downstream task. Evaluate the impact of pre-training data size, mask ratio, and symmetric masking strategy on the model's performance.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose novel approaches to address important challenges in their respective domains. Paper 1 investigates the influence of declarative knowledge on the generalization behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) during domain shifts, while Paper 2 proposes a Large EEG Model (LEM) for learning generic representations from diverse EEG datasets to improve performance on downstream tasks in brain-computer interaction (BCI).

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses a crucial problem in understanding how LLMs generalize to unseen examples, which is essential for ensuring their safety and fairness in real-world applications.
- Proposes a well-designed experimental setup with toy models and ablations to study the counterfactual effect of declarative statements on LLMs' generalization behavior.
- Investigates the internalization of knowledge in LLMs of different sizes, providing insights into the scaling properties of these models.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The use of toy models and synthetic datasets may limit the generalizability of the findings to real-world scenarios.
- The paper does not provide a clear theoretical framework to explain the observed phenomena, making it difficult to draw general conclusions.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the limitations of current EEG-based deep learning models by proposing a Large EEG Model (LEM) that can learn universal perceptual capabilities from diverse datasets.
- Proposes a novel pre-training approach, LaBraM, which uses vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction and masked EEG modeling to capture both temporal and spatial features of EEG signals.
- Validates the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, demonstrating its generalizability and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for pre-training and fine-tuning LaBraM, which may limit its practical applicability.
- The impact of different hyperparameters, such as the mask ratio and symmetric masking strategy, on the model's performance is not thoroughly investigated.

Conclusion:
While both papers make significant contributions to their respective fields, Paper 2 (Large Brain Model for Learning Generic Representations with Tremendous EEG Data in BCI) is likely to be accepted by a top AI conference. The proposed method, LaBraM, addresses a pressing need in the BCI community by enabling cross-dataset learning and capturing both temporal and spatial features of EEG signals. The extensive validation on multiple downstream tasks and the comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed approach. In contrast, Paper 1, although addressing an important problem, relies on toy models and synthetic datasets, which may limit the impact of its findings on real-world applications of LLMs.

paper 1:
Task Planning for Visual Room Rearrangement under Partial Observability:
  Title: Task Planning for Visual Room Rearrangement under Partial Observability
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of efficiently planning a sequence of actions for an embodied agent to simultaneously search for and rearrange objects in an untidy room to achieve a desired tidy state, under conditions of partial observability.
  Motivation: Existing methods for room rearrangement often emphasize perception and commonsense reasoning but lack efficient planning. They either assume complete visibility of the room or employ sub-optimal heuristic planners that do not minimize the number of steps or overall traversal. These methods also fail to resolve blocked goal and swap cases effectively. The proposed method aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a novel hierarchical task planner that leverages commonsense knowledge, deep reinforcement learning (RL), and a graph-based state representation to optimize the rearrangement process.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method consists of several key components: (i) a novel Search Network that uses commonsense knowledge from large language models to predict the locations of unseen objects, (ii) a Deep RL network trained with a proxy reward to plan the sequence of actions, (iii) a graph-based state representation to encode the scene geometry and make the planner scalable, and (iv) a sample-efficient cluster-biased sampling technique for training the proxy reward network and the Deep RL network. The method interleaves object search and rearrangement to minimize the number of steps and overall traversal, and it can handle blocked goal and swap cases without explicit buffers.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments use two datasets: (i) a Graph Dataset generated using Ai2Thor with random object placements to train the Graph Representation Network (GRN), and (ii) a Search Network Dataset derived from the AMT dataset to train the Search Network. Additionally, a new benchmark dataset, RoPOR, is introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of the rearrangement planning.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used include: (i) RoBERTa-Large for generating embeddings in the Search Network, (ii) a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for the Graph Representation Network, and (iii) a Parameterized Deep-Q Network for the Deep RL planner.
    Step 4: Train Models:
      Search Network: Train the Sorting Network (SRTN) using cross-entropy loss and the Scoring Network (SCN) using mean square error loss on the Search Network Dataset. Use an Adam optimizer with specific learning rates and weight decay rates.
      Graph Representation Network: Train the Graph Siamese Encoder Network (GSEN) and the Residual Geodesic Distance Network (RGDN) using mean square error loss on the Graph Dataset. Use an Adam optimizer with a specified learning rate.
      Deep RL and Proxy Reward Network: Train the Deep RL network using a 3-step method involving ϵ-greedy exploration, updating Q-values with predicted rewards from the Proxy Reward Network, and using polyak averaging to update target networks. Train the Proxy Reward Network using cluster-biased return decomposition (CB-RD) to generate episodic rewards.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the RoPOR benchmark dataset. Metrics include Success measured by the inverse Number of Steps (SNS), Efficiency in Number of Re-plans (ENR), and Absolute Traversal Cost (ATC).
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method against existing methods (Weihs et al., Gadre et al., Sarch et al., Ghosh et al.) and ablation studies (Ours-GT, Ours-RS, Ours-GE, Ours-DR) in terms of SNS, ENR, and ATC. Analyze the impact of different components and hyper-parameters on the overall performance.


paper 2:
LLM-Oriented Retrieval Tuner:
  Title: LLM-Oriented Retrieval Tuner
  Problem Statement: Dense Retrieval (DR) is a promising tool to enhance the memorization capacity of Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 by incorporating external memories. However, integrating retrieval and generation tasks in a shared LLM remains an open challenge due to the paradigm discrepancy between text generation and DR.
  Motivation: Existing methods typically require fine-tuning LLMs as retrieval-specific representation models, which is feasible but suboptimal. LLMs are designed to maximize the likelihood of generating the next token based on context, while DR involves mapping text into a vector space where semantically similar texts are closer together. This divergence makes it difficult for a single LLM to handle both tasks efficiently, leading to additional model parameters and longer inference times. The proposed method, LMORT, aims to decouple DR capacity from the base LLM and non-invasively coordinate the LLM's layers towards a unified DR space, achieving efficient and effective DR without tuning the LLM itself.
  Proposed Method: LMORT (LLM-Oriented Retrieval Tuner) decouples the DR capacity from the base LLM and coordinates the optimally aligned and uniform layers of the LLM towards a unified DR space. It uses a Transformer-like structure with two bidirectional attention operations in each layer: self-attention on the LLM's optimal alignment layer and cross-attention on the LLM's best uniformity layer. This approach merges the alignment and uniformity properties of the frozen LLM into a unified space conducive to effective retrieval.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use six zero-shot retrieval datasets from the BEIR benchmark: TREC-COVID, NFCorpus, FiQA, ArguAna, SciFact, and SCIDOCS. For training, use the MS MARCO dataset with about 500k web query-positive passages and training negatives released by sentence-transformers.
    Step 2: Select Models: Focus on three LLMs: GPT2-Large (0.75B), GPT2-XL (1.5B), and GPT-j-6B (6B).
    Step 3: Determine Optimal Layers: Analyze the alignment and uniformity losses for each layer of the LLMs to identify the optimal alignment and uniformity layers. For GPT2-Large, the optimal layers are #36 (alignment) and #37 (uniformity). For GPT2-XL, they are #4 (alignment) and #49 (uniformity). For GPT-j-6B, they are #1 (alignment) and #29 (uniformity).
    Step 4: Construct LMORT: Build LMORT with a multi-layer architecture on top of the LLM's optimal alignment and uniformity layers. Each LMORT layer contains self-bi-attention on the alignment layer and cross-bi-attention on the uniformity layer, followed by a feed-forward layer.
    Step 5: Train LMORT: Fine-tune LMORT using the standard DR training method. Optimize the parameters of LMORT while keeping the LLM parameters frozen. Use a batch size of 8, a learning rate of 5e-6, and train for 3 epochs. Evaluate the models using the checkpoint from the last training step.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the zero-shot retrieval performance of LMORT on the six BEIR datasets using the NDCG@10 metric. Compare the results with strong DR baselines like BM25, DPR, GTR-XXL, and cpt-text-L.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the alignment and uniformity losses in the output layer of LMORT and compare them to the optimal alignment and uniformity layers of the LLM. Assess the parameter and training efficiency of LMORT, including the impact of dimensionality reduction on performance and training time.

Both papers address important challenges in their respective domains. Paper 1 focuses on efficient task planning for visual room rearrangement under partial observability, while Paper 2 proposes a method to enhance the memorization capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating dense retrieval (DR) capabilities.

Paper 1 presents a novel hierarchical task planner that leverages commonsense knowledge, deep reinforcement learning, and a graph-based state representation to optimize the rearrangement process.

The paper provides a detailed experiment plan, including the use of six zero-shot retrieval datasets from the BEIR benchmark and a comparison with strong DR baselines.

While both papers make significant contributions, Paper 2 appears to have a more substantial impact on the field of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. The integration of dense retrieval capabilities into LLMs without the need for fine-tuning the entire model is a novel and promising approach. LMORT's ability to decouple DR capacity from the base LLM and achieve efficient and effective DR without tuning the LLM itself is a significant advancement. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the alignment and uniformity losses in the output layer of LMORT and assesses the parameter and training efficiency of the proposed method.

In contrast, Paper 1, while addressing an important problem in visual room rearrangement, has a more narrow scope and may have less overall impact on the broader field of AI and NLP. The proposed method, although novel and effective, is more focused on a specific application domain.

paper 1:
A Path Toward Primitive Machine Intelligence: LMM Not LLM Is What You Need:
  Title: A Path Toward Primitive Machine Intelligence: LMM Not LLM Is What You Need
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of developing machine intelligence for chemosensing, specifically the ability to detect and interpret chemical compositions, which is a primitive form of intelligence where animals, particularly dogs, excel. The problem is interesting and important because current machine learning models, such as large language models (LLMs) and deep reinforcement learning, have shown super-human capabilities in other domains but lack interpretability and efficiency in chemosensing tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods using deep learning on large datasets of hyperspectral hardware and spectrometers can potentially create artificial noses but suffer from a lack of interpretability. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to use linear mixture models (LMMs) to build an engineering theory of cognitive development for chemosensing. The proposed method is expected to work better because it offers a mathematically tractable and interpretable framework for understanding chemical mixtures, unlike the black-box nature of deep learning models.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves using linear mixture models (LMMs) to develop a cognitive theory for chemosensing. The approach is inspired by Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development and adapts it to the context of chemical mixtures. The method involves four stages: 1) Inferring the number of chemicals in a set of mixtures, 2) Learning spectral representations of the chemicals, 3) Estimating the concentration of a chemical in a mixture, and 4) Interpreting why a mixture is good or bad by reasoning from past examples. The method emphasizes foundational and analytical theory over empirical successes on real-world datasets.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Create synthetic datasets using Algorithm 1 provided in the paper. The datasets should simulate linearly mixed observations and their underlying chemical concentrations. The parameters for the synthetic datasets include the number of chemicals (M), number of sensor channels (N), dynamic range of a pure spectrum (R), sensitivity of chemical concentration standard deviations (S), and the number of samples over time (T).
    Step 2: Model Architecture and Data Construction: Use the Wolfram Language to simulate the LMM given the hardware parameters. Generate pure spectra for each chemical and sample chemical concentrations from uniform distributions. Calculate the signal intensity for each sample. The dataset and Wolfram Language code for the analysis are provided in the supplementary file.
    Step 3: Infer the Number of Chemicals: Perform an eigenvalue cutoff of the sample covariance matrix to infer the chemical dimension (M). Rescale the observations to have a unit mean value at each sensory channel. Evaluate methods for dimensionality estimation, including Malinowski indicator function, Akaike information criterion, minimum description length, HySime, and random matrix theory.
    Step 4: Learn Spectral Representations: Solve the overdetermined system to estimate the pure spectra (⃗am). Evaluate existing methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), independent component analysis (ICA), and principal component analysis (PCA). Develop novel update rules for ICA and NMF to improve convergence.
    Step 5: Estimate Chemical Concentrations: Use the dot product of the observations with an ideal pseudo-inverse spectrum to estimate the underlying chemical concentrations. Analyze the error scaling law to guarantee parts-per-trillion sensitivity. Investigate the limits of accurate estimation in the presence of noisy observations.
    Step 6: Interpret Mixture Quality: Develop mathematical models to interpret why a mixture is good or bad by reasoning from past examples. Test the models on real-world open-access datasets, such as spectral measurements on the skin to detect skin diseases or predicting pH levels of farmland patches using hyperspectral images. Focus on datasets where the response units are binary for initial experiments.

Knowledge Fusion of Large Language Models:
  Title: Knowledge Fusion of Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is costly and often results in redundant capabilities. The paper addresses the challenge of merging existing pre-trained LLMs with different architectures into a single, more potent model.
  Motivation: Existing methods like ensemble techniques and weight merging are impractical for LLMs due to their substantial memory and inference time requirements, and they often assume uniform network architectures. The proposed method, knowledge fusion, aims to combine the capabilities of existing LLMs and transfer them into a single LLM, potentially elevating the target model's capabilities beyond those of any individual source LLM.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, FUSELLM, leverages the generative distributions of source LLMs to externalize their collective knowledge and unique strengths. This knowledge is then transferred to a target LLM through lightweight continual training. The method involves aligning tokenizations from different LLMs and fusing their probability distributions. The fusion process emphasizes minimizing the divergence between the target LLM’s probabilistic distributions and those of the source LLMs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use MiniPile, a compact and diverse dataset curated from The Pile, consisting of approximately 1 million documents across 22 domains and 1.8 billion tokens.
    Step 2: Select Models: Choose three popular open-source LLMs with different architectures: Llama-2, OpenLLaMA, and MPT. Use another Llama-2 7B as the target LLM.
    Step 3: Token Alignment: Align tokens across multiple LLMs using the MinED (minimum edit distance) strategy to foster coherent probabilistic interpretations across models.
    Step 4: Fusion Function: Fuse the probabilistic distribution matrices using the MinCE (minimum cross-entropy) function, which outputs the distribution matrix with the minimum cross-entropy score.
    Step 5: Training: Continually train the target LLM on the MiniPile dataset using a batch size of 128 and a maximum length of 2048 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Use a combination of the causal language modeling objective and the fusion objective, with a weighted combination parameter λ set to 0.9.
    Step 6: Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of FUSELLM on three benchmarks: Big-Bench Hard (BBH) for reasoning, Common Sense (CS) for commonsense capability, and MultiPL-E (ME) for code generation. Use metrics like exact match (EM) accuracy for BBH and CS, and pass@1 for ME.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of FUSELLM with the original LLMs and the continually trained Llama-2 (Llama-2 CLM). Analyze the improvements in reasoning, commonsense, and code generation tasks.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1, "A Path Toward Primitive Machine Intelligence: LMM Not LLM Is What You Need," tackles the problem of developing machine intelligence for chemosensing using linear mixture models (LMMs). The paper's strength lies in its novel approach to adapting Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development to the context of chemical mixtures. The proposed method offers a mathematically tractable and interpretable framework for understanding chemical mixtures, which is a significant advantage over the black-box nature of deep learning models. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured and includes a comprehensive evaluation of existing methods and the development of novel update rules. However, the paper's focus on synthetic datasets and the lack of extensive real-world dataset experiments may limit its immediate practical impact.

Paper 2, "Knowledge Fusion of Large Language Models," addresses the challenge of merging existing pre-trained LLMs with different architectures into a single, more potent model. The proposed method, FUSELLM, leverages the generative distributions of source LLMs to externalize their collective knowledge and unique strengths, which is then transferred to a target LLM through lightweight continual training. The paper's strength lies in its innovative approach to combining the capabilities of existing LLMs, potentially elevating the target model's capabilities beyond those of any individual source LLM. The experiment plan is well-designed, using diverse datasets and popular open-source LLMs, and includes a comprehensive evaluation on multiple benchmarks. The paper's focus on real-world applications and its potential to improve the performance of LLMs in reasoning, commonsense, and code generation tasks makes it more likely to have a significant impact on the field.

In conclusion, while both papers present novel and interesting ideas, Paper 2 appears to have a more substantial potential for immediate impact and practical applications. Its innovative approach to knowledge fusion and the well-designed experiment plan, along with the focus on real-world datasets and benchmarks, make it a stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.

Style Over Substance: Evaluation Biases for Large Language Models:
  Title: Style Over Substance: Evaluation Biases for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, accurately and comprehensively evaluating their performance becomes increasingly challenging. Human evaluations are conventionally considered the gold standard in natural language generation, but recent advancements incorporate state-of-the-art LLMs as proxies for human judges in evaluation processes. However, the extent to which humans and LLMs are capable evaluators remains uncertain.
  Motivation: Existing methods, including human evaluations and LLMs as proxies for human judges, exhibit biases and limitations. Human judges often rate answers with factual errors more favorably than those with grammatical errors or shorter lengths. This indicates a bias towards style over substance. The proposed method aims to address these biases by independently evaluating machine-generated text across multiple dimensions, rather than merging all evaluation aspects into a single score. This approach is inspired by the need for a more comprehensive and transparent understanding of the quality of machine-generated text.
  Proposed Method: The study proposes the Multi-Elo Rating System (MERS), which evaluates machine-generated text across multiple dimensions independently. This system uses the Elo rating system, originally devised for chess, to rate the quality of text based on 'Accuracy', 'Helpfulness', and 'Language'. By separating these dimensions, the method aims to provide a more nuanced and accurate evaluation of LLM outputs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Curate a dataset of intentionally flawed machine-generated answers. Use 40 general-purpose questions sourced from Chiang et al. (2023) that do not require specialized expertise to ensure the generalization of the study and reduce annotation difficulty.
    Step 2: Generate Answers: Use GPT-4 to generate answers with specific instructions. Generate answers with varying lengths (approximately 100 words and 50 words), language proficiency levels (advanced and intermediate English learners), and factual accuracy (correct, minor errors, major errors). Manually review and edit the generated answers to ensure they conform to the desired criteria.
    Step 3: Conduct Annotations: Engage a diverse pool of annotators, including crowd-sourced annotators, expert annotators, and LLMs (GPT-4 and Claude-1). Provide a simple interface for annotators to select the better output or indicate a tie between two model-generated responses. Ensure unbiased evaluation by presenting all answer pairs from both forward and reversed directions.
    Step 4: Calculate Elo Ratings: Calculate the Elo ratings for each 'model' based on the judgments of crowd-sourced annotators, expert annotators, and LLMs. Perform the Elo rating calculation 10,000 times with varying random orderings to minimize the influence of the ordering of games.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the Elo ratings to understand the preferences of different judges when deciding on high-quality model outputs. Investigate biases towards longer texts, indecisiveness among human judges, and the impact of answer order on judgments. Compare the effectiveness of the Multi-Elo Rating System in enhancing the evaluation quality of LLMs, particularly in terms of factual accuracy.
    Step 6: Evaluate Multi-Elo Rating System: Implement the Multi-Elo Rating System to assess machine-generated text from multiple dimensions ('Accuracy', 'Helpfulness', 'Language'). Compare the results obtained from expert annotators and GPT-4 using separate and compound prompts for each dimension. Analyze the differences in evaluation outcomes and determine the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Provable Robust Watermarking for AI-Generated Text:
  Title: Provable Robust Watermarking for AI-Generated Text
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of watermarking text generated by large language models (LLMs) to ensure the responsible use of these models. The goal is to develop a watermarking method that can embed a secret message within the generated text, which can later be detected to verify the text's origin. This problem is important because it helps mitigate the misuse of LLMs, such as generating fake news, contaminating web content, or assisting in academic dishonesty.
  Motivation: Existing methods for detecting AI-generated text either rely on statistical patterns, which are not robust to distribution changes and adversarial attacks, or on soft watermarking techniques that can be easily circumvented by text editing or paraphrasing. The proposed method, Unigram-Watermark, aims to provide a more robust solution by using a fixed grouping strategy for watermarking, which ensures that the watermark remains detectable even after text modifications. The proposed method is expected to work better than existing baselines because it offers guaranteed generation quality, correctness in watermark detection, and robustness against text editing and paraphrasing.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Unigram-Watermark, involves the following steps: 1) Randomly partition the vocabulary into a 'green list' and a 'red list'. 2) Increase the logits of the language model for the green list tokens by a fixed amount (δ) while keeping the red list logits unchanged. 3) During detection, count the number of green tokens in the suspect text and compute a z-statistic to determine if the text is watermarked. This method ensures that the watermark is robust to edits and maintains high generation quality.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use two long-form text datasets: OpenGen and LFQA. OpenGen consists of 3K two-sentence chunks from the validation split of WikiText-103, and LFQA is a long-form question-answering dataset with 3K QA pairs from Reddit.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use three state-of-the-art public language models: GPT2-XL (1.5B parameters), OPT-1.3B, and LLaMA-7B. Load the models from the Huggingface library and use the generate API function to adjust the logits distribution of the language model.
    Step 3: Apply Watermarking: For each model, apply the Unigram-Watermark method with a watermark strength of δ=2.0 and a green list ratio of γ=0.5. Generate 500 watermarked sentences and 500 un-watermarked sentences using the models on the two datasets.
    Step 4: Construct Prompts: For baseline, generate the output directly from the models. For the proposed method, generate the output using the watermarked models. For detection, use the detection key to find the green list and calculate the z-statistic for the suspect text.
    Step 5: Evaluate Detection Performance: Calculate the z-scores for watermarked and un-watermarked text. Set the false positive rates at 1% and 10% for all detection algorithms and adjust the detection threshold accordingly. Report true positive rate (TPR), F1 score, and ROC curves.
    Step 6: Evaluate Text Quality: Evaluate the text quality using perplexity scores and human evaluations. Use GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) as the oracle model for perplexity evaluation. Conduct human evaluations by enlisting crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate the quality of both watermarked and un-watermarked texts.
    Step 7: Test Robustness Against Attacks: Test the robustness of the watermark against paraphrasing and editing attacks. Use different paraphrase attack techniques (e.g., ChatGPT, DIPPER, BART) and editing attacks (e.g., synonym replacement, random deletion, random swapping). Compare the detection performance of the proposed method against the baseline method (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023).
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the detection accuracy, robustness, and text quality of the proposed method against the baseline. Analyze whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in terms of watermark detection and robustness against attacks.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of large language models (LLMs). The first paper, "Style Over Substance: Evaluation Biases for Large Language Models," focuses on improving the evaluation of LLMs by addressing biases in human and LLM-based evaluations. The second paper, "Provable Robust Watermarking for AI-Generated Text," proposes a novel watermarking method to ensure the responsible use of LLMs and mitigate misuse.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the crucial issue of biases in LLM evaluation, which can lead to inaccurate assessments of model performance.
- Proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation approach (MERS) to provide a more nuanced and accurate evaluation of LLM outputs.
- Incorporates a diverse pool of annotators, including crowd-sourced annotators, expert annotators, and LLMs, to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.
- Analyzes the preferences of different judges and investigates biases towards longer texts, indecisiveness among human judges, and the impact of answer order on judgments.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The study is limited to a specific dataset of general-purpose questions, which may not fully represent the diverse range of tasks and domains LLMs are applied to.
- The effectiveness of the proposed MERS approach in real-world scenarios and its scalability to larger datasets and more complex tasks are not thoroughly explored.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the important issue of watermarking AI-generated text to ensure responsible use and mitigate misuse of LLMs.
- Proposes a novel and robust watermarking method, Unigram-Watermark, which is resistant to text editing and paraphrasing attacks.
- Evaluates the proposed method on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.
- Conducts a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including detection performance, text quality, and robustness against various attacks.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The study does not explore the potential impact of the watermarking method on the fluency and coherence of the generated text, which may be affected by the logit manipulation.
- The scalability of the proposed method to larger datasets and more diverse text generation tasks is not fully addressed.

Conclusion:
While both papers make significant contributions to the field of LLMs, Paper 2, "Provable Robust Watermarking for AI-Generated Text," appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance. The proposed Unigram-Watermark method addresses a critical issue in the responsible use of LLMs and demonstrates robust performance against various attacks. The thorough evaluation and analysis of the method across multiple models and datasets further strengthen its case for acceptance. In contrast, while Paper 1 addresses an important issue in LLM evaluation, its limited dataset and lack of real-world scalability analysis may hinder its acceptance in a top AI conference.

Look, Remember and Reason: Grounded Reasoning in Videos with Language Models:
  Title: Look, Remember and Reason: Grounded Reasoning in Videos with Language Models
  Problem Statement: Existing multi-modal language models (LMs) show promising performance in high-level reasoning tasks on videos but fall short in tasks requiring causal or compositional spatiotemporal reasoning over actions. These tasks need model predictions to be grounded in fine-grained low-level details such as object motions and interactions.
  Motivation: Current methods are inadequate for tasks requiring detailed spatiotemporal reasoning because they lack the ability to ground predictions in low-level visual details. The proposed method aims to address this by training an LM end-to-end on low-level surrogate tasks, including object detection, re-identification, and tracking. This approach leverages the LM's ability to perform these low-level tasks, enabling it to reason about videos through a three-step process: Look, Remember, Reason. This method is expected to outperform existing baselines by effectively integrating low-level visual skills with high-level reasoning capabilities.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves training an LM end-to-end on low-level surrogate tasks to endow it with the necessary visual capabilities. A two-stream video encoder with spatiotemporal attention is used to capture static and motion-based cues in the video. The LM is trained to perform low-level surrogate tasks, allowing it to extract and integrate visual information step-by-step to arrive at a final answer. The process is broken down into three steps: Look (extract visual information), Remember (store intermediate visual details), and Reason (integrate information to generate the final response). The method is demonstrated on diverse visual reasoning tasks from the ACRE, CATER, Something-Else, and STAR datasets.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets that require spatiotemporal reasoning, including ACRE, CATER, Something-Else, and STAR. These datasets provide a variety of visual reasoning tasks that involve object motions and interactions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each dataset, construct prompts that include surrogate tasks such as object detection, re-identification, and tracking. For example, for ACRE, use prompts like '<re-identify> object id 1, object class 1; ...; object id n, object class n'. For Something-Else, use '<track> object id 1, object bounding box 1; ...; object id n, object bounding box n'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use pre-trained LMs from the OPT family (e.g., OPT-125M, OPT-350M, OPT-1.3B) as the backbone for the LRR model. Fine-tune these models along with the two-stream video encoder and cross-attention layers.
    Step 4: Train Models: Train the LRR model end-to-end on the selected datasets. Use the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1×10−5, β1= 0.9, β2= 0.95, and λ (weight decay) = 0.1. Introduce surrogate tasks randomly during training with a probability of 30% after each input video frame.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the trained LRR model on the test sets of the selected datasets. Measure performance using metrics such as accuracy, Top-1, and Top-5 accuracy, and L1 grid error for tracking tasks.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the LRR model with existing baselines and ablations. Analyze the impact of surrogate tasks and the two-stream video encoder on the model's performance. Highlight the advantages of grounding the model to low-level visual details for spatiotemporal reasoning tasks.

LLM-based Stock Market Trend Prediction:
  Title: LLM-based Stock Market Trend Prediction
  Problem Statement: Investor sentiment, driven by factors such as news articles and options volume, has been historically resistant to effective use in quantitative methods for predictive market analysis. The paper aims to address this problem by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to link sentiment-driven responses with traditional quantitative features to predict market trends.
  Motivation: Existing quantitative methods struggle to incorporate investor sentiment effectively due to the complexity and dynamic nature of financial markets. Traditional statistical models often fail to capture the nuances of sentiment-driven factors. The proposed method leverages the emerging science of LLMs to capture and analyze these sentiments, potentially offering more accurate market predictions. LLMs can process extensive volumes of media reporting and generate insights that align with specific corpora of media input, thus providing actionable insights for investors.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves prompting available LLMs to generate responses that can be linked with traditional quantitative features. The approach includes analyzing moving averages, news sentiment, options volume, and supply-demand statistics. The method integrates these factors using LLMs to enhance the accuracy of market trend predictions. The process involves several steps: analyzing moving averages, incorporating news sentiment, evaluating options volume, and constructing dependency trees for supply-demand analysis.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect historical stock trends, news articles, options trading volumes, and supply-demand data for specific companies such as NVIDIA and Coinbase.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For news sentiment analysis, prompt the LLM to generate sentiment scores (+1 for positive, -1 for negative, and 0 for neutral) for each news item. For dependency analysis, prompt the LLM to analyze company reports and construct dependency graphs.
    Step 3: Select Models: Utilize LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for generating responses and analyzing data. Use TensorFlow for integrating the LLM outputs with traditional quantitative features.
    Step 4: Conduct Experiments: 1. Analyze the impact of moving averages (p10, p50, p200) on market trends. 2. Evaluate the influence of news sentiment on stock prices using StockNewsAPIs. 3. Assess the correlation between options trading volume and market trends. 4. Construct and analyze dependency trees for supply-demand factors.
    Step 5: Get Results: Aggregate the results from the different analyses and feed them into a TensorFlow machine learning model. Measure the accuracy of market trend predictions at each step.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the accuracy of predictions using different combinations of parameters (moving averages, news sentiment, options volume, and dependency graphs). Evaluate the incremental improvement in accuracy from 0.52 (moving averages) to 0.95 (combined parameters using LLMs).


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose using large language models (LLMs) to address complex problems in their respective domains. However, the strengths and weaknesses of each approach differ significantly.

Paper 1, "Look, Remember and Reason: Grounded Reasoning in Videos with Language Models," presents a novel approach to spatiotemporal reasoning in videos using LLMs. The main strength of this paper lies in its innovative method of training LLMs on low-level surrogate tasks to enable grounding of predictions in fine-grained visual details. This approach effectively integrates the LM's ability to perform low-level tasks with high-level reasoning capabilities, addressing a significant limitation in existing multi-modal LMs. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured, using diverse datasets and appropriate evaluation metrics. The proposed method has the potential to advance the field of video understanding and reasoning.

On the other hand, Paper 2, "LLM-based Stock Market Trend Prediction," attempts to use LLMs to incorporate investor sentiment into quantitative market analysis. While the idea of leveraging LLMs to capture sentiment-driven factors is interesting, the paper lacks a clear and convincing methodology. The proposed approach of linking LLM-generated responses with traditional quantitative features is not well-defined, and the step-by-step experiment plan lacks the necessary detail to assess its feasibility. Additionally, the claim of achieving a 0.95 accuracy in market trend predictions using the combined parameters seems overly optimistic and not sufficiently substantiated.

In comparing the two papers, Paper 1 demonstrates a more rigorous and innovative approach to utilizing LLMs in its domain. The proposed method is well-motivated, and the experiment plan is carefully designed to validate the approach. In contrast, Paper 2 lacks the methodological clarity and experimental rigor needed to convince reviewers of its potential impact.

Therefore, based on the strengths and weaknesses of the two papers, Paper 1 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

paper 1:
Evaluating Large Language Models at Evaluating Instruction Following:
  Title: Evaluating Large Language Models at Evaluating Instruction Following
  Problem Statement: As the development of large language models (LLMs) accelerates, there is a growing need for scalable and cost-effective evaluation methods. This paper addresses the problem of evaluating the efficacy of LLM-based evaluators, particularly in assessing instruction following, which measures how closely generated text adheres to given instructions.
  Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLMs, such as human evaluations, are not scalable or reproducible. LLM-based evaluations have emerged as a promising alternative but have not been rigorously tested for their ability to discern instruction-following outputs. The proposed method aims to fill this gap by introducing a challenging meta-evaluation benchmark, LLMBar, which tests the ability of LLM evaluators to identify instruction-following outputs. The authors argue that current meta-evaluation strategies overlook the inherent subjectivity of human preferences and do not reliably reflect the evaluators' capabilities to detect objective qualities like instruction following.
  Proposed Method: The authors introduce LLMBar, a manually curated meta-evaluation benchmark consisting of 419 instances. Each instance includes an instruction paired with two outputs: one that follows the instruction and one that deviates but may have deceptive qualities. The benchmark is divided into two sets: NATURAL, which reflects real-world distributions, and ADVERSARIAL, which includes adversarially crafted instances to challenge LLM evaluators. The authors also propose a suite of novel prompting strategies, including Rules, Metrics, and Swap, to improve the performance of LLM evaluators.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The LLMBar benchmark is created by manually curating 419 instances from existing datasets like AlpacaFarm and LLMEval2. The NATURAL set is filtered and modified to ensure objective preferences, while the ADVERSARIAL set is adversarially crafted to challenge LLM evaluators.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the baseline, use simple prompts to ask the LLM to choose the better output. For the proposed method, use the following strategies:
(1) Rules: Explicitly list general rules for LLM evaluators to follow when making comparisons.
(2) Metrics: Generate instruction-specific metrics that a good output should adhere to and provide these metrics to the LLM evaluator.
(3) Swap: Present the outputs in different orders and synthesize the evaluations to mitigate positional bias.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate the performance of five LLMs: GPT-4, ChatGPT, LLaMA-2-Chat, PaLM2, and Falcon, paired with various prompting strategies.
    Step 4: Get Results: Query the LLM evaluators twice with swapped orders for each output pair and report average accuracy and positional agreement rate. Compare the performance of different LLMs and prompting strategies on the LLMBar benchmark.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LLM evaluators on the NATURAL and ADVERSARIAL sets. Assess the impact of different prompting strategies on evaluator performance. Compare the results with existing meta-evaluation benchmarks like FairEval, LLMEval2, and MT-Bench to highlight the unique challenges posed by LLMBar.

Keqing: Knowledge-based Question Answering is A Nature Chain-of-Thought mentor of LLMs:
  Title: Keqing: Knowledge-based Question Answering is A Nature Chain-of-Thought mentor of LLMs
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance on various NLP tasks, especially question answering. However, they tend to generate nonsensical responses when faced with problems beyond their knowledge scope. This issue, known as 'hallucination,' undermines the reliability of LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods like retrieval-augmented LMs often bring redundant context input, which can degrade the quality of responses. The proposed method, Keqing, aims to address this by leveraging structured information from knowledge graphs to guide LLMs through interpretable logical chains, thereby improving the reliability and interpretability of responses.
  Proposed Method: Keqing is a novel framework that assists LLMs in retrieving question-related structured information from knowledge graphs. It acts as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mentor, guiding LLMs to sequentially find answer entities for complex questions through interpretable logical chains. The workflow involves four stages: Question Decomposition, Knowledge Retrieval, Candidate Reasoning, and Response Generation. This approach decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves candidate entities, reasons answers, and generates responses with reasoning paths.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate Keqing on three KBQA benchmark datasets: MetaQA, WebQuestionsSP (WebQSP), and GrailQA. MetaQA consists of a movie ontology and question-answer pairs of varying difficulty. WebQSP contains questions answerable by Freebase. GrailQA is a diverse KBQA dataset built on Freebase, covering multiple domains.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Question Decomposition: Instruction: The AI assistant can parse the user input into several sub-questions. Input: I recently watched the movie Written on the Wind, and I think it was well made. I’d like to know what other works the director of this film has done and which famous actors were in them. Output: {"question": "who was the director of [mask]?", "id": 0, "dep": [-1], "args": {"seed_entities": ["Written on the Wind"]}}, {"question": "[mask] was the director of which movies?", "id": 1, "dep": [0], "args": "seed_entities": ["<GENERATED>-0"]}}, {"question": "who acted in the movie [mask]?", "id": 2, "dep": [1], "args": "seed_entities": "<GENERATED>-1"]}}]
      Candidate Reasoning: Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the user's question. If you don’t know the answer, just say that you don’t know, don’t try to make up an answer. Input: Who was the director of Written on the Wind? Output: ["Douglas Sirk"]
      Response Generation: Instruction: With the task execution logs, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and inference results. Please first think carefully and directly answer my request based on the inference results. Then please detail your workflow step by step including the used models and inference results for my request in your friendly tone. Please filter out information that is not relevant to my request. If there is nothing in the results, please tell me you can’t make it. Input: Execution Logs. Output: Based on the inference results, the director of Written on the Wind is Douglas Sirk. The movies that Douglas Sirk directed include Shockproof, All That Heaven Allows, Magnificent Obsession, A Time to Love and a Time to Die, There’s Always Tomorrow, The Tarnished Angels, Meet Me at the Fair, Lured, Sleep, My Love, All I Desire, Battle Hymn, Imitation of Life, and Written on the Wind. The actors who starred in these movies are Cornel Wilde, Claudette Colbert, Boris Karloff, Rock Hudson, Don Ameche, Robert Cummings, John Gavin, Patricia Knight, Charles Coburn, Lucille Ball, Barbara Stanwyck, Lauren Bacall, Dorothy Malone, Rochelle Hudson, and Sandra Dee.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use LLaMA (7B) fine-tuned with LoRA for Question Decomposition and Candidate Reasoning. For Response Generation, we use ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo).
    Step 4: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks. Evaluate on MetaQA, WebQSP, and GrailQA datasets. Metrics include Hits@1 for MetaQA and F1 score for WebQSP and GrailQA.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in evaluating and improving large language models (LLMs). The first paper, "Evaluating Large Language Models at Evaluating Instruction Following," focuses on developing a benchmark and prompting strategies to assess the ability of LLMs to evaluate instruction-following outputs. The second paper, "Keqing: Knowledge-based Question Answering is A Nature Chain-of-Thought mentor of LLMs," proposes a framework that leverages structured information from knowledge graphs to guide LLMs in answering complex questions.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the need for scalable and reproducible evaluation methods for LLMs
- Introduces a novel benchmark, LLMBar, with both natural and adversarial instances
- Proposes novel prompting strategies to improve LLM evaluator performance
- Provides a clear and detailed experiment plan

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The benchmark size (419 instances) may be limited in capturing a wide range of instruction-following scenarios
- The focus is on evaluating LLMs as evaluators, which may have a narrower scope compared to Paper 2

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles the important issue of LLM hallucination when faced with questions beyond their knowledge scope
- Proposes a novel framework, Keqing, that leverages structured information from knowledge graphs
- Introduces a Chain-of-Thought mentoring approach to guide LLMs through interpretable logical chains
- Evaluates the proposed method on three diverse KBQA benchmark datasets

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The reliance on knowledge graphs may limit the applicability of the method to domains with well-structured information
- The experiment plan lacks some details, such as the specific baselines being compared against

Comparing the two papers, Paper 2 (Keqing) appears to have a broader impact on improving LLM performance in question answering tasks. By addressing the hallucination issue and leveraging structured information, Keqing has the potential to enhance the reliability and interpretability of LLM-generated responses. Additionally, the evaluation on three diverse KBQA benchmark datasets demonstrates the method's applicability across different domains.

In contrast, while Paper 1 introduces a novel benchmark and prompting strategies for evaluating LLM evaluators, its scope is more limited to the specific task of assessing instruction-following outputs. The benchmark size and focus on evaluating LLMs as evaluators may restrict its overall impact compared to Keqing.

Therefore, based on the broader impact and potential to improve LLM performance in question answering tasks, Paper 2 (Keqing) is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

A Critical Study of What Pre-trained Code Models (do not) Learn:
  Title: A Critical Study of What Pre-trained Code Models (do not) Learn
  Problem Statement: Pre-trained code models (PCMs) have shown success in various coding assistance tasks, but they fail to generalize well beyond the datasets they are trained on and in real-world applications. This study aims to understand the properties of code that PCMs may not fully encode, particularly focusing on syntactic and data flow relations.
  Motivation: While previous studies have shown that PCMs can encode syntactic and semantic relations among input tokens, they often fail to generalize well and produce outputs with syntactic and semantic errors. This suggests that there are limitations in what these models learn. The study aims to identify these limitations and understand why they exist, with the goal of improving the generalizability and robustness of PCMs.
  Proposed Method: The study conducts a fine-grained analysis of self-attention and hidden representations in PCMs to understand what relations are encoded. It categorizes input tokens into syntactic tokens and identifiers and examines the encoding of syntactic-syntactic, identifier-identifier, and syntactic-identifier relations. The study uses attention analysis and probing on hidden representations to evaluate the encoding of these relations.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Randomly sample 3000 Python codes from the test set of the CodeSearchNet (CSN) dataset after removing docstrings and comments.
    Step 2: Select Models: Conduct experiments on five models: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXcoder, CodeT5, and PLBART. These models encompass different pre-training objectives and architectures.
    Step 3: Attention Analysis:
      Setup: Create model graphs from the attention maps of each head in the models. Create syntax and data flow graphs from the code. Compare the model graphs with the code graphs using precision, recall, and graph edit distance (GED) metrics.
      Threshold Selection: Evaluate F-scores for all heads across various models and layers at different threshold values to determine the optimal threshold for attention analysis.
    Step 4: Probing on Hidden Representations:
      Setup: Use DirectProbe to study the properties encoded in the hidden representations. Create datasets for each layer of the models, representing different tasks such as data flow edge prediction, siblings in the AST, and tree distance prediction.
      Tasks:
        Data Flow Edge Prediction: Evaluate whether hidden representations encode data flow relations among identifiers.
        Siblings Prediction: Evaluate whether hidden representations encode syntactic relations among tokens.
        Tree Distance Prediction: Evaluate whether hidden representations encode information to understand subtle differences in code syntax.
    Step 5: Analyze Results:
      Attention Analysis: Compare the precision, recall, and GED per node between model graphs and code graphs. Identify which relations are well-encoded and which are not.
      Probing Analysis: Evaluate the quality of clustering in DirectProbe and the number of clusters formed. Determine whether hidden representations encode relations linearly or non-linearly and assess the accuracy of label predictions.

ToolChain*:
  Title: ToolChain*: Efficient Action Space Navigation in Large Language Models with A* Search
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful decision-making and planning capabilities in solving complicated real-world problems. However, the multitude of candidate API function calls significantly expands the action space, amplifying the critical need for efficient action space navigation. Existing methods either struggle with unidirectional exploration in expansive action spaces, getting trapped in locally optimal solutions, or suffer from exhaustively traversing all potential actions, causing inefficient navigation.
  Motivation: Existing methods for navigating the action space in LLM-based agents are either inefficient or prone to getting stuck in suboptimal solutions. Open-loop methods generate a complete plan without adaptation, while greedy closed-loop methods and standard closed-loop methods rely on environmental feedback but explore only a small portion of the action space. Tree search-based methods like DFS and MCTS require exhaustive exploration, leading to inefficiency. ToolChain* is inspired by the need to balance exploration and exploitation efficiently, leveraging the A* search algorithm to prune high-cost branches and identify the most promising paths.
  Proposed Method: ToolChain* is an efficient tree search-based planning algorithm for LLM-based agents. It formulates the entire action space as a decision tree, where each node represents a possible API function call involved in a solution plan. By incorporating the A* search algorithm with task-specific cost function design, it efficiently prunes high-cost branches that may involve incorrect actions, identifying the most low-cost valid path as the solution. The cost function is composed of cumulative cost and future cost, which are designed to penalize erroneous actions and prioritize promising paths. ToolChain* effectively balances exploration and exploitation within an expansive action space.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate ToolChain* on four tool-use environments from ToolBench (Home Search, Trip Booking, Google Sheets, Virtual Home) and one reasoning task from GSM8K.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For tool-use tasks, we follow the prompt format from ToolBench, which includes API documents, three-shot in-context demonstration examples, and the query. For math reasoning tasks, we use prompts that include the question and a step-by-step reasoning process.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 as the foundational LLMs for our experiments. Additionally, we fine-tune LLaMA-2 (7B and 13B) models for open-source LLM experiments.
    Step 4: Implement ToolChain*: Formulate the action space as a decision tree. At each step, select the most promising node based on the cost function, expand the node with potential actions, and update the cost functions. The cost function includes cumulative cost (combining task-specific heuristic function and self-consistency frequency) and future cost (combining task-specific heuristic function and imagination score by LLM).
    Step 5: Get Results: Get predictions from the models on these datasets using both the baselines and ToolChain*.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of ToolChain* with state-of-the-art baselines on planning and reasoning tasks. Evaluate metrics such as success rate, running time, and efficiency. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of the cost function.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of large language models (LLMs) and propose novel approaches to tackle these challenges. However, there are notable differences in the focus, methodology, and potential impact of the two studies.

Paper 1 focuses on understanding the limitations of pre-trained code models (PCMs) in encoding syntactic and data flow relations. The study aims to identify what properties of code PCMs may not fully capture, which could explain their lack of generalizability and robustness in real-world applications. The proposed method involves a fine-grained analysis of self-attention and hidden representations in PCMs using attention analysis and probing techniques. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured and includes a diverse set of models and tasks to evaluate the encoding of different relations. The findings from this study could provide valuable insights into improving the design and training of PCMs for better generalization and robustness.

On the other hand, Paper 2 addresses the challenge of efficient action space navigation in LLMs for solving complex real-world problems. The study proposes ToolChain*, an efficient tree search-based planning algorithm that leverages the A* search algorithm with task-specific cost function design to balance exploration and exploitation in expansive action spaces. The motivation behind ToolChain* is well-justified, highlighting the limitations of existing methods in terms of efficiency and optimality. The proposed method is evaluated on a diverse set of tool-use environments and reasoning tasks, with a clear step-by-step experiment plan. The potential impact of ToolChain* is significant, as it could enable LLMs to efficiently navigate large action spaces and solve complex problems more effectively.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 2 (ToolChain*) appears to have a slight edge in terms of the novelty and potential impact of the proposed method. Efficient action space navigation is a critical challenge in deploying LLMs for real-world applications, and ToolChain* offers a promising solution that could significantly improve the performance and efficiency of LLM-based agents. Additionally, the diverse set of evaluation tasks and the inclusion of open-source LLMs demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed method.

In conclusion, while both papers make valuable contributions to the field, Paper 2 (ToolChain*) is likely to be the accepted idea due to its novel approach, potential impact, and strong experimental design.

CompA: Addressing the Gap in Compositional Reasoning in Audio-Language Models:
  Title: CompA: Addressing the Gap in Compositional Reasoning in Audio-Language Models
  Problem Statement: Audio-language models (ALMs) have shown improved performance in various downstream applications by learning shared representations between audio and language modalities. However, their ability to perform compositional reasoning, which is crucial for understanding the order and attributes of acoustic events, remains largely unexplored and underdeveloped.
  Motivation: Existing ALMs, such as CLAP, often act as a bag of words and lack natural language comprehension, particularly in understanding the interrelationships among multiple discrete acoustic events. This deficiency is partly due to the nature of contrastive pre-training, which optimizes for retrieval rather than compositional understanding. Prior research in vision-language models has shown similar deficiencies, but no such attempts have been made in the audio space. The proposed method aims to fill this gap by introducing benchmarks and a novel learning paradigm to improve compositional reasoning in ALMs.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes CompA, a collection of two expert-annotated benchmarks (CompA-order and CompA-attribute) to evaluate compositional reasoning in ALMs. Additionally, it introduces CompA-CLAP, a fine-tuned version of CLAP, which employs a novel learning method to enhance compositional reasoning abilities. The training involves improvements to contrastive training with composition-aware hard negatives and a modular contrastive loss that helps the model learn fine-grained compositional understanding.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets used include CompA-661k for vanilla contrastive pre-training, AudioSet-CompA for training with compositionally-aware hard negatives, and a synthetic dataset created using a template-based approach for modular contrastive learning. Evaluation is done using the CompA-order and CompA-attribute benchmarks.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For generating hard negatives, use GPT-4 to create compositionally-aware negative captions by swapping acoustic event ordering, replacing prepositions, or swapping noun-verb associations. For modular contrastive learning, use a template-based approach to create compositional audio and captions from single acoustic events and their labels.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used include the HTSAT-large audio encoder and the Flan-T5-large text encoder. The initial model is CLAP, which is then fine-tuned using the proposed methods.
    Step 4: Train Models:
      Vanilla Contrastive Learning: Train CLAP on CompA-661k with a batch size of 24, Adam optimizer, learning rate of 1e-4, warm-up of 3200 steps, and for 45 epochs.
      Contrastive Learning with Hard Negatives: Fine-tune CLAP using AudioSet-CompA with compositionally-aware hard negatives. Train for 20 epochs with no warm-up, using a batch size of 24 and Adam optimizer.
      Modular Contrastive Learning: Generate ≈251k synthetic audio-caption pairs using a template-based approach. Fine-tune the model initialized from the hard negative training stage, using a batch size of 24 and Adam optimizer.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the CompA-order and CompA-attribute benchmarks using text-to-audio and audio-to-text retrieval tasks, as well as zero-shot classification on datasets like ESC-50, US8K, VGGSound, and FSD50K.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of CompA-CLAP with baselines like MMT, ML-ACT, CLAP, and CLAP-LAION. Analyze the improvements in compositional reasoning capabilities and the retention of performance on existing retrieval and zero-shot classification benchmarks.

Beyond Size: How Gradients Shape Pruning Decisions in Large Language Models:
  Title: Beyond Size: How Gradients Shape Pruning Decisions in Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, making them challenging to deploy in real-world applications. The goal is to prune these models to reduce their size and computational requirements without compromising their performance.
  Motivation: Existing pruning methods like Weights Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda focus on weights or a combination of weights and activations but overlook the informative gradients derived from pretrained LLMs. These methods either lack theoretical depth or are too complex, requiring weight updates or matrix inverses. The proposed method, GBLM-Pruner, leverages gradients in a training-free manner, aiming to outperform existing methods by providing a more robust and interpretable pruning metric.
  Proposed Method: GBLM-Pruner is a gradient-based pruning method that operates without retraining. It uses normalized gradients from a few calibration samples to determine the importance of weights. The method combines the magnitude of weights with the ℓ1 or ℓ2 norm of gradients across samples to form a pruning metric. This approach reveals structural patterns post-pruning, reflecting the geometric interdependence in LLMs' parameter structure.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 models for evaluation. Calibration data consists of 128 sequences with 2048 tokens randomly sampled from the first shard of the C4 training data.
    Step 2: Construct Pruning Metric: Compute the pruning metric as the elementwise product of the weight magnitude and the ℓ1 or ℓ2 norm of the gradients across multiple samples. Optionally, include the multiplication of weight and the ℓ2 norm of input activations.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate on six models from the LLaMA-1 series (7B, 13B, 30B) and the LLaMA-2 series (7B, 13B, 70B).
    Step 4: Prune Models: Apply the GBLM-Pruner method to prune the models uniformly across all linear layers except the embedding layer and the final classification head. Experiment with different pruning granularities such as layer-wise, input-wise, and output-wise.
    Step 5: Evaluate Performance: Assess the performance of the pruned models using two metrics: Perplexity on WikiText validation data and Zero-shot Evaluation on the Eleuther AI lm-evaluation harness benchmark. Compare the results with baseline methods (Magnitude pruning, SparseGPT, and Wanda).
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the perplexity and zero-shot task performance of the pruned models against the baselines. Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the pruning metric and the number of calibration samples.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of large language models (LLMs) and propose novel methods to tackle them. However, there are notable differences in the focus, methodology, and potential impact of the two papers.

Paper 1 (CompA) focuses on improving compositional reasoning in audio-language models (ALMs) by introducing new benchmarks and a novel learning paradigm. The motivation is well-established, highlighting the limitations of current ALMs in understanding the interrelationships among multiple discrete acoustic events. The proposed method, CompA-CLAP, employs a combination of composition-aware hard negatives and modular contrastive learning to enhance the model's compositional reasoning abilities. The step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive and includes the creation of new datasets, prompt construction, model selection, training, and evaluation. The analysis of results aims to compare CompA-CLAP with existing baselines and assess its improvements in compositional reasoning while retaining performance on retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks.

Paper 2 (GBLM-Pruner) addresses the challenge of pruning LLMs to reduce their size and computational requirements without compromising performance. The motivation highlights the limitations of existing pruning methods and proposes a gradient-based approach that leverages informative gradients from pretrained LLMs. The proposed method, GBLM-Pruner, combines the magnitude of weights with the norm of gradients across samples to form a pruning metric. The experiment plan is well-structured, including dataset selection, pruning metric construction, model selection, pruning, evaluation, and analysis. The paper aims to compare the performance of GBLM-Pruner with baseline methods and conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 1 (CompA) appears to have a slight edge in terms of novelty, potential impact, and the thoroughness of the proposed method. Improving compositional reasoning in ALMs is a crucial challenge that has not been extensively explored, and the introduction of new benchmarks and a novel learning paradigm could significantly advance the field. The combination of composition-aware hard negatives and modular contrastive learning is a well-thought-out approach that addresses the limitations of current ALMs. Additionally, the comprehensive experiment plan and the inclusion of multiple baselines for comparison demonstrate the authors' commitment to rigorous evaluation.

In contrast, while Paper 2 (GBLM-Pruner) proposes an interesting gradient-based pruning method, the novelty and potential impact may not be as significant as Paper 1. Pruning LLMs is an active research area with several existing methods, and the proposed approach, while promising, may not represent a substantial leap forward. The experiment plan is solid but lacks the same level of depth and thoroughness as Paper 1.

paper 1:
Test-Time Adaptation with CLIP Reward for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models:
  Title: Test-Time Adaptation with CLIP Reward for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models
  Problem Statement: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot generalization capabilities under language supervision. However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between training and testing data, leading to degraded performance in zero-shot scenarios.
  Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for VLMs in zero-shot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, which often results in the model becoming stuck in incorrect predictions. These methods lack a mechanism to provide feedback to rectify the model's output, leading to overconfidence in wrong predictions. The proposed method aims to address these shortcomings by introducing a feedback mechanism using a CLIP model as a reward model during TTA, which helps in rectifying the model's output and improving its zero-shot generalization capability.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Reinforcement Learning with CLIP Feedback (RLCF), involves using a CLIP model to provide feedback during TTA. The VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. This framework is flexible and can be applied to various tasks such as classification, retrieval, and image captioning. The method involves task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice to improve the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For image classification, use ImageNet and its variants (ImageNet-A, ImageNet-V2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-Sketch). For text-image retrieval, use the test set of Flickr30K and the test split of MS-COCO. For image captioning, use the test set of Flickr30K and the validation set of NoCaps.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use CLIP-ViT-B/16 as the base VLM for all tasks. For reward models, use CLIP-ViT-L/14, CLIP-ViT-L/14-336, and CLIP-RN50 ×64.
    Step 3: Implement TTA Pipelines:
      Image Classification:
        Prompt Tuning: Initialize with CoOp prompts. Use data augmentations to generate multiple views of a single test image. Select low-entropy predictions and sample top-K classes for reward calculation. Optimize learnable parameters using policy gradient.
        Image Encoder Tuning: Use the same data augmentation and sampling strategy as prompt tuning. Optimize the image encoder parameters using policy gradient.
      Text-Image Retrieval:
        Text-to-Image Retrieval: Fix the image encoder and update the text encoder. Sample top-K images for each query and calculate rewards.
        Image-to-Text Retrieval: Fix the text encoder and update the image encoder. Sample top-K texts for each image and calculate rewards.
      Image Captioning:
        CapDec: Use CapDec model trained with text. During TTA, only tune the projector that maps CLIP features to LLM token embedding space. Use beam search to sample K captions and calculate rewards.
        CLIPCap: Use CLIPCap model trained with images. Follow the same TTA procedure as CapDec.
    Step 4: Get Results: Run the TTA process for each task and collect the performance metrics. For image classification, measure top-1 and top-5 accuracy. For text-image retrieval, measure Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10. For image captioning, measure BLEU@4, CIDEr, SPICE, and RefCLIPScore.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed RLCF method with baselines such as zero-shot CLIP, CoOp, TPT, and knowledge distillation. Evaluate the effectiveness of RLCF in improving zero-shot generalization across different tasks and datasets.


paper 2:
Contrastive Decoding Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models:
  Title: Contrastive Decoding Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with reasoning tasks, making errors in abstract reasoning and sometimes resorting to simpler modes like copying sections of the input. This problem is significant because it limits the effectiveness of LLMs in applications requiring complex reasoning, such as mathematical problem-solving and commonsense reasoning.
  Motivation: Existing methods like greedy decoding and nucleus sampling have limitations. Greedy decoding, while avoiding sampling errors, often leads to reasoning mistakes. Nucleus sampling, although better for long-form generation, does not perform well on reasoning tasks. The proposed method, Contrastive Decoding (CD), aims to address these issues by leveraging the differences in likelihood between strong and weak models to improve reasoning performance. CD is expected to work better because it prevents abstract reasoning errors and avoids simpler modes like copying input sections.
  Proposed Method: Contrastive Decoding searches for strings that maximize a weighted difference in likelihood between a stronger expert model and a weaker amateur model. The method involves the following steps: 1. Determine the α-mask to filter out low-probability tokens from the expert model. 2. Subtract the amateur model's logits from the expert model's logits, weighted by a hyperparameter β. This results in a new set of logits that are used for text generation. The method is computationally light and training-free, making it easy to implement.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Evaluate on a variety of datasets including GSM8K for math word problems, HellaSwag for commonsense reasoning, and other benchmarks like AQuA, ASDiv, MATH, SVAMP, CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, ARC-E, ARC-C, BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA, WinoGrande, and MMLU.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use untuned models from the LLaMA 1 family at all scales, with LLaMA-65B as the expert model and a 1.5B parameter LLaMA model as the amateur. Also, conduct ablation studies with models from the FLAN-T5 family.
    Step 3: Set Decoding Parameters: Set β=0.5 and α=0.1 for all experiments unless otherwise stated. Use greedy decoding, except for self-consistency experiments where sampling at τ=0.7 is used.
    Step 4: Construct Prompts: For generation tasks, use 8-shot chain-of-thought prompting. The examples are the same as in LLaMA for tasks contained in that paper, and taken from Wei et al. (2023) for other mathematical tasks.
    Step 5: Get Results: Generate predictions using both greedy decoding and Contrastive Decoding. Measure performance on the various datasets using metrics like exact match score for commonsense reasoning tasks and accuracy for math word problems.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Contrastive Decoding against greedy decoding and nucleus sampling. Analyze the types of errors made by each method, focusing on arithmetic errors, missing steps, semantic misunderstandings, and degeneration. Also, evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters and amateur model sizes on performance.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose interesting methods to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in different tasks. Paper 1 focuses on improving the zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) using test-time adaptation with CLIP reward, while Paper 2 aims to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs using contrastive decoding.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the problem of distribution shifts between training and testing data in VLMs
- Proposes a novel method, RLCF, which uses a CLIP model to provide feedback during test-time adaptation
- Flexible framework that can be applied to various tasks such as classification, retrieval, and image captioning
- Well-structured experiment plan with clear steps and evaluation metrics

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- Focuses only on vision-language models, which may limit its broader impact on other types of LLMs
- The effectiveness of the method relies heavily on the quality of the CLIP reward model

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles the important problem of improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs
- Proposes a computationally light and training-free method, contrastive decoding, which is easy to implement
- Evaluates the method on a wide range of datasets covering various reasoning tasks
- Includes ablation studies and analysis of different types of errors made by the method

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The method's effectiveness may depend on the choice of expert and amateur models
- The hyperparameters (β and α) may require tuning for optimal performance on different tasks

Comparing the two papers, Paper 2 seems to have a broader impact on improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, which is a fundamental challenge in the field. The contrastive decoding method is simple, training-free, and applicable to a wide range of reasoning tasks. Additionally, the extensive evaluation on multiple datasets and the detailed analysis of the method's performance make Paper 2 a stronger candidate for acceptance.

On the other hand, while Paper 1 proposes a novel method for improving zero-shot generalization in VLMs, its focus is more narrow compared to Paper 2. The reliance on the quality of the CLIP reward model may also limit its generalizability to other domains.

In conclusion, based on the broader impact, simplicity, and extensive evaluation of the proposed method, Paper 2 appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance.

SASS: Self-Alignment with Semi-Supervised Instruction Data Generation:
  Title: SASS: Self-Alignment with Semi-Supervised Instruction Data Generation
  Problem Statement: The success of instruction tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on the availability of high-quality instruction data. However, generating such data is costly and often relies on powerful closed-source models, which come with usage restrictions that prevent their outputs from being used to develop machine learning models.
  Motivation: Existing methods that use closed-source models to generate instruction data are not viable due to their usage restrictions. This paper explores the potential of using open-source models to generate high-quality instruction data for themselves. The proposed method aims to overcome the limitations of open-source models by employing semi-supervised strategies to enhance the quality and diversity of the generated data.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves using open-source models to generate instruction data through two main semi-supervised strategies: self-training and instruction-generation. The self-training strategy generates responses for existing unsupervised instructions, while the instruction-generation strategy generates instructions for unsupervised responses. Additionally, two novel techniques are introduced: instruction filtering to ensure alignment between instructions and responses, and an extract-then-generate strategy to improve instruction diversity.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use Lima and Dolly as seed human-annotated instruction data. For self-training, use input instructions from ShareGPT. For instruction-generation, use documents from the minipile as candidate responses.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For self-training, prompt the model to generate responses for given instructions. For instruction-generation, reverse the input and output of human-annotated instruction data to train a seed instruction generation model, then use this model to generate instructions for selected unsupervised documents.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use LLaMA-7B as the backbone model. Implement models with the open-source toolkit Transformers. Fine-tune models using AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5, batch size of 32, and training for 3 epochs.
    Step 4: Generate Data: For self-training, fine-tune the model with seed data, then generate responses for collected instructions. For instruction-generation, generate instructions for selected documents using the seed instruction generation model.
    Step 5: Instruction Filtering: Generate multiple candidate instructions for each selected response using random sampling. Calculate the perplexity (PPL) of the response for each candidate instruction using the instruction-following model. Select the instruction with the lowest PPL score.
    Step 6: Extract-then-Generate Strategy: Extract fragments from documents using three strategies: Keywords (using Yake), Random Sentence, and LLM Extraction (using Dolly). Generate instructions for these fragments to improve diversity.
    Step 7: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the generated instruction data on the LongForm benchmark and GPT-4 evaluation. Use METEOR score for LongForm and Alpaca Eval for GPT-4 evaluation.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the generated instruction data with various baselines, including LLaMA-GPT4, Evol-Instruct, Dromedary, Dolly, Lima, and LongForm. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of the proposed strategies on performance and instruction diversity.


paper 2:
Knowledge Neuron Thesis Reassessment:
  Title: What does the Knowledge Neuron Thesis Have to do with Knowledge?
  Problem Statement: The paper reassesses the Knowledge Neuron (KN) Thesis, which posits that large language models (LLMs) recall facts from a training corpus through multi-layer perceptron (MLP) weights, implying that 'knowledge' is stored in the network. The paper aims to determine whether this thesis adequately explains the process of factual expression in LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods inspired by the KN thesis, such as model editing techniques, have shown some success in altering the generation of factual information. However, these methods have limitations, including their inability to fully explain the process of factual expression and their reliance on oversimplified interpretations of how knowledge is stored in LLMs. The paper seeks to explore whether the KN thesis can be extended to explain linguistic phenomena and to evaluate the robustness of these methods using more comprehensive criteria.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation of the KN thesis by extending the scope of assessment to include both factual and syntactic phenomena. It introduces new evaluation metrics, such as bijective symmetry and synonymous invariance, to test the robustness of model-editing methods. The paper also explores the localization of syntactic phenomena to individual neurons and compares this with the localization of factual information.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the BLiMP corpus for syntactic phenomena and the P ARAREL corpus for factual information. Additionally, use the CounterFact and ZsRE corpora for further evaluation of model-editing methods.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For factual information, use fill-in-the-blank cloze tasks from P ARAREL. For syntactic phenomena, use minimal pairs from BLiMP to create prompts that test determiner-noun agreement, subject-verb agreement, and anaphor agreement.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate on BERT (bert-base-cased), GPT-2 (base and XL versions), and LLaMA-2 (7B parameter version). Use the HuggingFace package for implementation.
    Step 4: Identify Knowledge Neurons: For each prompt, calculate the integral-of-gradient attribution score for intermediate neurons. Identify neurons with high attribution scores that are common across multiple prompts. Adjust thresholds to ensure the number of identified neurons is within the range of 2-5.
    Step 5: Suppress Identified Neurons: Suppress the activation of identified neurons and observe the effect on the model's output probability for various number-expressing prenominal modifiers and syntactic phenomena.
    Step 6: Evaluate Localization: Measure the level of localization using metrics such as the number of identified neurons, the final threshold, and a generalized n-sample similarity measure. Compare the localization of syntactic phenomena with that of factual information.
    Step 7: Assess Robustness of Model-Editing Methods: Introduce new evaluation criteria, bijective symmetry and synonymous invariance, to test the robustness of model-editing methods. Construct evaluation datasets using P ARAREL relations and test whether the model can generalize edits across symmetric and synonymous prompts.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the effectiveness of model-editing methods on both factual and syntactic phenomena. Evaluate the reliability of KN edit and ROME methods using the new criteria. Discuss whether the identified patterns constitute 'knowledge' and the implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of LLMs.

- Explores the localization of syntactic phenomena to individual neurons and compares it with the localization of factual information, potentially providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of LLMs.

Weaknesses of Paper 2 (Knowledge Neuron Thesis Reassessment):
- The paper focuses on reassessing an existing thesis rather than proposing a novel method or solution, which may limit its impact on advancing the state-of-the-art in NLP.
- The experiments are conducted on a limited set of models and datasets, which may not fully capture the generalizability of the findings to other LLMs and domains.

Conclusion:
While both papers address important topics in NLP and LLMs, Paper 1 (SASS) is likely to be the accepted idea due to its novel contributions in generating high-quality instruction data using open-source models. The proposed semi-supervised strategies and innovative techniques have the potential to significantly improve the accessibility and reproducibility of AI systems. In contrast, Paper 2 (Knowledge Neuron Thesis Reassessment), although valuable in critically reassessing the KN thesis, does not propose a novel solution and may have limited impact on advancing the state-of-the-art in NLP.

Meaning Representations from Trajectories in Autoregressive Models:
  Title: Meaning Representations from Trajectories in Autoregressive Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of extracting meaning representations from autoregressive language models. Unlike encoder-based models, autoregressive models do not construct explicit representations of sentences, making it difficult to analyze how these models understand and contextualize language.
  Motivation: Existing methods for representing sentences typically involve embedding them in a vector space, which may not faithfully reflect the original model’s internal representation and can be skewed by biases present in the data. Additionally, prompt engineering, a common approach for autoregressive models, is highly susceptible to the choice of prompt and does not provide a structured semantic space. The proposed method aims to overcome these limitations by representing sentences as distributions of their possible continuations, which can model asymmetric relations and be applied to any pre-trained autoregressive model without fine-tuning or prompts.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method represents the meaning of a sentence as the distribution of all possible trajectories extending an input text. This approach is grounded in distributional perspectives on semantics and connected to automata theory. The method involves sampling trajectories from the model and using algebraic operations between likelihood functions to model asymmetric relations. The semantic distance between sentences is computed by comparing the expected difference in log-likelihood between their continuations.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets used for evaluation include the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks, Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, WordNet for hypernym/hyponym relations, and Crisscrossed Captions (CxC) for multimodal tasks.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: This paper does not rely on prompt engineering. Instead, it focuses on sampling trajectories from the model to represent the meaning of sentences.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used include GPT-2, GPT-2-XL, Falcon-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA-33B, Vicuna-13B, and StableVicuna-13B for text-based tasks. For multimodal tasks, the LLaVA model is used.
    Step 4: Sample Trajectories: For each input sentence, sample 10-20 trajectories of up to 20 tokens each using multinomial sampling with a temperature of 1.0. This step is crucial for approximating the distribution of continuations.
    Step 5: Compute Semantic Distance: Compute the semantic distance between sentences using the log-likelihood difference of their sampled trajectories. Use the Log-L1 distance function for this purpose.
    Step 6: Evaluate on Textual Similarity: Evaluate the method on the STS benchmarks by comparing the computed semantic distances with human-annotated similarity scores using the Spearman coefficient.
    Step 7: Evaluate on Entailment: For the SNLI-Entailment task, use the Entailment Test to determine the direction of entailment between sentence pairs. Compare the results with baseline methods.
    Step 8: Evaluate on Hypernym/Hyponym Relations: Use the Hyponym Test to recover hypernym/hyponym relations from WordNet. Sample contexts containing the target words from the WikiText corpus and compute the semantic containment relations.
    Step 9: Evaluate on Multimodal Tasks: For the CxC dataset, compute semantic distances between image-image and image-text pairs using the LLaVA model. Optionally, use alignment prompts to improve the performance on image-text similarity tasks.
    Step 10: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with baseline methods on all tasks. Analyze whether the new method improves the alignment of model representations with human annotations and outperforms zero-shot and prompt-free baselines.

Instance Needs More Care:
  Title: Instance Needs More Care: Rewriting Prompts for Instances Yields Better Zero-Shot Performance
  Problem Statement: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform tasks in zero-shot settings is highly desirable due to its labor-saving nature and better task generalizability. However, LLMs often struggle with zero-shot performance, especially on complex tasks like mathematical reasoning, logical reasoning, and code generation.
  Motivation: Existing methods focus on devising more effective task instructions, such as 'let's think step by step,' but these single-task instructions often lack the necessary specificity and clarity for individual test instances. This can lead to suboptimal performance, especially for complex tasks. The proposed method, PRoMTd, aims to rewrite the task prompt for each individual test input to be more specific, unambiguous, and complete, thereby providing better guidance to the task LLM.
  Proposed Method: PRoMTd rewrites the task prompt for each individual test input to make it more specific, unambiguous, and complete. This is achieved by formulating the prompt rewriting task itself as a few-shot in-context learning problem. The approach leverages a set of 10 demonstrations distributed across 5 different task types to learn the skill. The rewritten prompts are then executed against the zero-shot LLM to elicit the response. The method uses GPT-4 as both the task LLM and the rewriting LLM.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate PRoMTd on eight datasets covering tasks including arithmetics (GSM-8k, MATH), logical reasoning (Date Understanding, Sports Understanding, Analytical Entailment, Known-Unknowns, Anachronisms), and code generation (HumanEval).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the baseline, we use naive zero-shot prompting and zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. For PRoMTd, we first prompt the model to rewrite the task prompt for each individual test input. The rewritten prompt is then used to generate the final response. Example prompts include: 'Josh decides to flip a house. He bought a house for $80,000 then invested an additional $50,000 for its repairs. After repairs, the house's value increased such that it's now worth 150% more than the price at which he bought it. Calculate the profit he made after selling the house, considering both the buying price and cost of repairs. Print the output in the format "The answer is \answer{}".'
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT-4 as both the task LLM (Mtask) and the rewriting LLM (Mrewrite).
    Step 4: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and the proposed method.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of PRoMTd with the naive zero-shot and zero-shot CoT baselines. Metrics include accuracy for mathematical reasoning and logical reasoning tasks, and Pass@1 for code generation tasks. Analyze whether the rewritten prompts improve the zero-shot performance of LLMs.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The effectiveness of PRoMTd may depend on the quality and diversity of the demonstrations used for few-shot in-context learning.
- The computational cost of rewriting prompts for each individual test input may be high, especially for large datasets or real-time applications.
- The method relies on GPT-4 as both the task LLM and the rewriting LLM, which may limit its applicability to other models or settings.

Conclusion:
Both papers make valuable contributions to the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, Paper 1 appears to have a more comprehensive evaluation plan, covering a wider range of tasks and datasets. It also proposes a more general approach that can be applied to any pre-trained autoregressive model without the need for fine-tuning or prompts. In contrast, Paper 2 focuses specifically on improving zero-shot performance and relies on GPT-4 for both the task and rewriting LLMs. Therefore, considering the broader applicability and more extensive evaluation, Paper 1 seems to be the stronger candidate for acceptance.

paper 1:
Eliciting Attributions from LLMs with Minimal Supervision:
  Title: Eliciting Attributions from LLMs with Minimal Supervision
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for recalling information, but the mechanisms they use to encode and store vast amounts of information within their parameters are not well understood. This lack of understanding poses challenges for improving the interpretability and reliability of LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods for enabling LLMs to attribute their responses often involve post-hoc attribution or end-to-end modeling to generate references, but these approaches do not enable the model to generate the actual attribution itself. The proposed method aims to address this gap by fine-tuning LLaMA models to generate attributions with minimal supervision, leveraging the model's own parametric knowledge. This approach is expected to improve the performance of LLMs on downstream tasks and reveal their memorization capabilities.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, AttributeLLaMA, involves fine-tuning LLaMA models using 100 expert-annotated attribution examples. The model is trained to generate an evidence or attribution passage along with the answer to a given question. The process involves prompting the model to first generate the evidence and then the answer, following the Chain-of-Thought prompting literature. The model is fine-tuned with minimal supervision to ensure that the generated attributions are derived from the model's own learned corpora.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on a diverse range of tasks including MMLU, StrategyQA, Natural Questions, TriviaQA, WebQ, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and OpenBookQA.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, we prompt the model to generate an evidence passage followed by the answer. The input prompt can be as follows: 'Answer the following question by first generating an evidence and using it to answer. Question: (q) Evidence: (e) Answer: (a)'. For evaluation, we construct an input prompt such as: 'Use the following context to answer: (e) Question: (q) Answer:'. In case of k-shot tasks, we use the same exemplars as the baseline task and insert the context before the query.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use two variants of the LLaMA model: 7B and 65B. AttributeLLaMA is fine-tuned on these models using 100 expert-annotated attribution examples.
    Step 4: Training Details: We use a small batch size and learning rate to allow for more optimization steps. The Adam optimizer is used with an initial learning rate of 1×10−6 and a warm-up of 10 steps. The batch size is 8, and the maximum number of optimization steps is 100 for both the 7B and 65B models. The objective function is optimized only on the loss from the target tokens.
    Step 5: Get Results: Generate attributions for each test example in the datasets and use them as context for the model to answer the questions. Evaluate the change in model performance with this additional context.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LLaMA models with and without attributions on the downstream tasks. Analyze the quality of the generated attributions in terms of memorization and hallucination. Use lexical overlap scores and named entity precision scores to assess the quality of attributions.

Privately Aligning Language Models with Reinforcement Learning:
  Title: Privately Aligning Language Models with Reinforcement Learning
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and feedback while ensuring privacy. This is crucial because LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in applications that require them to follow user instructions and preferences. However, the process of aligning these models using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) raises significant privacy concerns, as the models could potentially memorize and regurgitate sensitive user data.
  Motivation: Existing methods for aligning LLMs with human feedback do not adequately address privacy concerns. Traditional RLHF methods can lead to privacy leaks, where models inadvertently memorize and expose sensitive information from the training data. The inspiration behind the proposed method is to leverage Differential Privacy (DP) to ensure that the alignment process does not compromise user privacy. The proposed method aims to provide strong privacy guarantees while maintaining competitive utility, making it a safer approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces a DP framework for aligning LLMs using RL. The framework consists of three main steps: 1) Differentially Private Supervised Fine-Tuning (DP SFT) of the pre-trained model, 2) Differentially Private Learning of the Reward Model, and 3) Differentially Private Proximal Policy Optimization (DP PPO) for fine-tuning the policy. Each step ensures that the final model parameters are differentially private with respect to the training data. The method adapts the PPO algorithm to the DP setting and uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient and stable DP training.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For the positive review generation task, use the IMDb dataset. For the summarization task, use the Reddit TL;DR dataset and the human feedback dataset released by OpenAI.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use GPT-2 model families (base, medium, and large) for both tasks. For the reward model in the positive review generation task, use the RoBERTa base model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis with the TweetEval benchmark.
    Step 3: Differentially Private Supervised Fine-Tuning (DP SFT):
      Description: Fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-2 models using DPSGD with privacy parameters (ϵ, δ) on the respective datasets.
      Hyperparameters:
        Batch Size: 512
        Learning Rate: 0.0003
        Number of Epochs: 40
        Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay 0.01
    Step 4: Differentially Private Learning of Reward Model:
      Description: Train the reward model using DPSGD with privacy parameters (ϵ, δ) on the human feedback dataset.
      Hyperparameters:
        Batch Size: 4096
        Learning Rate: 0.0002
        Number of Epochs: 50
        Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay 0.01
    Step 5: Differentially Private Proximal Policy Optimization (DP PPO):
      Description: Fine-tune the policy using DP PPO with the reward model on the respective datasets.
      Hyperparameters:
        Minibatch Size: 256
        Batch Size: 4096
        Number of Epochs: 100
        Learning Rate:
          GPT-2: 0.003
          GPT-2 Medium: 0.001
          GPT-2 Large: 2e-05
        Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay 0.01
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the test sets of the IMDb and Reddit TL;DR datasets. Use the average positive reward score for the positive review generation task and the average reward score and ROUGE metrics for the summarization task.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the differentially private models with the non-private models. Assess the trade-off between privacy and utility by varying the privacy budget (ϵ).

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of large language models (LLMs). Paper 1 focuses on improving the interpretability and reliability of LLMs by eliciting attributions with minimal supervision, while Paper 2 tackles the problem of aligning LLMs with human preferences and feedback while ensuring privacy.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the lack of understanding of how LLMs encode and store information
- Proposes a novel method, AttributeLLaMA, to generate attributions with minimal supervision
- Leverages the model's own parametric knowledge to improve performance on downstream tasks
- Evaluates the method on a diverse range of tasks
- Provides a detailed step-by-step experiment plan

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- Limited to two variants of the LLaMA model (7B and 65B)
- Relies on expert-annotated attribution examples, which may be time-consuming and expensive to obtain
- Does not address privacy concerns related to the use of LLMs

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the crucial issue of privacy in aligning LLMs with human preferences and feedback
- Proposes a novel differentially private framework for aligning LLMs using reinforcement learning
- Ensures strong privacy guarantees while maintaining competitive utility
- Evaluates the method on two relevant tasks: positive review generation and summarization
- Provides a detailed step-by-step experiment plan with specific hyperparameters

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- Limited to the GPT-2 model family (base, medium, and large)
- May require a large amount of human feedback data for effective alignment
- The trade-off between privacy and utility may limit the model's performance compared to non-private models

While both papers make significant contributions, Paper 2 stands out for its novel approach to addressing the critical issue of privacy in aligning LLMs with human preferences. The proposed differentially private framework has the potential to make the alignment process safer and more trustworthy, which is essential for the widespread adoption of LLMs in real-world applications. Additionally, the paper provides a more comprehensive and detailed experiment plan, including specific hyperparameters and evaluation metrics.

In contrast, while Paper 1 proposes an interesting method for improving the interpretability of LLMs, it does not address the pressing concern of privacy, which is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are deployed in sensitive domains. Moreover, the reliance on expert-annotated examples may limit the scalability of the proposed method.

Mixture-of-Supernets:
  Title: Mixture-of-Supernets: Improving Weight-Sharing Supernet Training with Architecture-Routed Mixture-of-Experts
  Problem Statement: Weight-sharing supernets are crucial for performance estimation in neural architecture search (NAS) frameworks. However, in NLP tasks like machine translation and pre-trained language modeling, there is a significant performance gap between supernets and models trained from scratch. This gap necessitates retraining after finding optimal architectures, which is time-consuming and inefficient.
  Motivation: Existing weight-sharing supernets directly share weights among different subnetworks, leading to suboptimal performance due to issues like co-adaptation and gradient conflict. This results in a large performance gap between supernets and standalone models, especially in NLP tasks. The proposed method, Mixture-of-Supernets (MoS), aims to enhance the expressive power of supernets by using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach, which customizes weights for specific architectures through an architecture-based routing mechanism. This method is expected to minimize retraining time and improve training efficiency, yielding better performance in NAS for NLP tasks.
  Proposed Method: Mixture-of-Supernets (MoS) introduces a generalized supernet formulation where different subnetworks share weights indirectly through an architecture-based routing mechanism. The method involves two variants: layer-wise MoS and neuron-wise MoS. In layer-wise MoS, architecture-specific weights are constructed based on a weighted combination of expert weight matrices at the level of sets of neurons. In neuron-wise MoS, weights are generated at the level of individual neurons. The routing mechanism dynamically generates weights based on the architecture, enhancing the model's expressive power and reducing the performance gap between supernets and standalone models.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For BERT pretraining, use Wikipedia and Books Corpus. For machine translation, use WMT'14 En-De, WMT'14 En-Fr, and WMT'19 En-De datasets.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Model Architecture and Training Objectives:
      BERT Pretraining:
        Architecture Encoding: List of hidden sizes at each layer for SuperShaper's search space; list of four elastic hyperparameters for AutoDistil's search space.
        Training Settings: Batch size of 2048, maximum sequence length of 128, 125K training steps, learning rate of 5e-4, weight decay of 0.01, and 10K warmup steps.
      Machine Translation:
        Architecture Encoding: List of 10 values including encoder/decoder embedding dimensions, number of layers, FFN intermediate dimensions, attention heads, and encoder-decoder attention.
        Training Settings: 40K training steps, Adam optimizer, cosine learning rate scheduler, warmup from 10^-7 to 10^-3 with cosine annealing.
    Step 4: Select Models: For BERT, use the top model from the pareto front of SuperShaper and AutoDistil. For machine translation, use the top models from the pareto front of HAT.
    Step 5: Get Results:
      BERT: Evaluate on GLUE benchmark tasks (MNLI, CoLA, MRPC, SST2, QNLI, QQP, RTE) and compare average GLUE scores.
      Machine Translation: Evaluate on WMT'14 En-De, WMT'14 En-Fr, and WMT'19 En-De using BLEU scores.
    Step 6: Analyze Results:
      BERT: Compare the performance gap between supernet and standalone models. Analyze the improvements in average GLUE scores with layer-wise and neuron-wise MoS.
      Machine Translation: Compare the mean absolute error (MAE) and Kendall rank correlation coefficient between supernet and standalone BLEU scores. Analyze the latency-BLEU tradeoffs and additional training steps required to close the performance gap.

LILO: Learning Interpretable Libraries by Compressing and Documenting Code:
  Title: LILO: Learning Interpretable Libraries by Compressing and Documenting Code
  Problem Statement: While large language models (LLMs) excel at code generation, a key aspect of software development is refactoring: consolidating code into libraries of reusable and readable programs. The challenge is to build libraries that are not only efficient but also interpretable and grounded in natural language.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as DreamCoder, are computationally intensive and often produce libraries that are not easily interpretable, requiring domain expertise and knowledge of lambda calculus. The proposed method, LILO, aims to combine the strengths of LLMs in program synthesis with symbolic compression techniques to create libraries that are both efficient and interpretable. The motivation is to leverage LLMs to expedite the discovery of program solutions and improve the interpretability of learned libraries through auto-documentation.
  Proposed Method: LILO is a neurosymbolic framework that iteratively synthesizes, compresses, and documents code to build libraries tailored to specific problem domains. It consists of three interconnected modules: (1) A dual-system synthesis module that uses LLM-guided search and enumerative search to find solutions to programming tasks. (2) A compression module that identifies useful abstractions from the existing solution set using Stitch, a high-performance symbolic compression system. (3) An auto-documentation (AutoDoc) module that generates human-readable function names and docstrings, improving interpretability and aiding the LLM synthesizer in using the learned abstractions effectively.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate LILO on three inductive program synthesis benchmarks: string editing (REGEX), scene reasoning (CLEVR), and graphics composition (LOGO).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the LLM Solver, we construct prompts that include a domain description, a list of available DSL primitives, a set of example task/program pairs, and a target task description. For AutoDoc, we prompt the LLM to generate human-readable names and descriptions for the abstractions generated by Stitch, using a structured JSON format.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use OpenAI's Codex model (code-davinci-002) for LLM-guided search and gpt-3.5-turbo for AutoDoc. We also use Stitch for symbolic compression.
    Step 4: Run LLM Solver: For each task, we prompt the LLM Solver to generate program completions, filter out invalid programs, and check for task solutions. We run this process iteratively, updating the set of solved tasks and the library of abstractions.
    Step 5: Perform Compression: Using the set of solved tasks, we run Stitch to identify reusable abstractions and update the library. This involves rewriting the solution set in terms of the new abstractions and ensuring that the overall description length is minimized.
    Step 6: Auto-Document Abstractions: For each new abstraction generated by Stitch, we prompt the LLM to generate a human-readable name and description. This step ensures that the abstractions are interpretable and can be effectively used in future synthesis tasks.
    Step 7: Evaluate Performance: We evaluate the performance of LILO on the test sets of the three benchmarks, comparing it to existing methods like DreamCoder. We measure the percentage of tasks solved, the quality of the learned libraries, and the interpretability of the abstractions.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: We analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of LILO in solving complex tasks and learning rich libraries. We also assess the impact of AutoDoc on the interpretability and usability of the abstractions.

Both papers propose interesting ideas to address important challenges in their respective domains. The Mixture-of-Supernets (MoS) paper focuses on improving the performance of weight-sharing supernets in neural architecture search (NAS) for NLP tasks, while the LILO paper aims to build interpretable and efficient libraries by combining large language models (LLMs) with symbolic compression techniques.

Strengths of MoS:
1. Addresses the significant performance gap between supernets and standalone models in NLP tasks.
2. Proposes a novel architecture-based routing mechanism to enhance the expressive power of supernets.
3. Provides a clear and detailed experiment plan, including datasets, model architectures, and evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses of MoS:
1. The proposed method may introduce additional computational overhead due to the architecture-based routing mechanism.
2. The paper does not discuss the interpretability or explainability of the learned architectures.

Strengths of LILO:
1. Combines the strengths of LLMs in program synthesis with symbolic compression techniques to create efficient and interpretable libraries.
2. Introduces an auto-documentation module to improve the interpretability of learned abstractions.
3. Evaluates the proposed method on multiple inductive program synthesis benchmarks.

Weaknesses of LILO:
1. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with existing methods like DreamCoder in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.
2. The effectiveness of the auto-documentation module in improving interpretability may depend on the quality of the generated names and descriptions.

While both papers have their merits, the LILO paper stands out for its innovative approach to building interpretable and efficient libraries by leveraging LLMs and symbolic compression. The auto-documentation module is a particularly novel and valuable contribution, as it directly addresses the challenge of interpretability in learned abstractions. Additionally, the evaluation of LILO on multiple benchmarks demonstrates its potential for generalization across different problem domains.

In contrast, while the MoS paper proposes a promising method to improve the performance of supernets in NLP tasks, it does not explicitly address the interpretability of the learned architectures, which is an increasingly important consideration in the field of NAS.

The two project proposals are:

paper 1:
Are Large Language Models Post Hoc Explainers?:
  Title: Are Large Language Models Post Hoc Explainers?
  Problem Statement: The paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used as post hoc explainers for other predictive models. This is important because while LLMs have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks, their potential in explaining the behavior of other models remains relatively unexplored. The need for effective post hoc explainers is critical due to the limitations of existing methods, which often require white-box access and are computationally expensive.
  Motivation: Existing explanation techniques often require white-box access to the model and/or are computationally expensive, which limits their applicability. The innovation of in-context learning (ICL) in LLMs, which allows them to learn new tasks by providing a few examples in the prompt during inference time, presents a promising alternative. The proposed method leverages the internal knowledge and ICL capabilities of LLMs to generate explanations, potentially offering a more efficient and accessible solution compared to traditional methods.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes a novel framework that includes four prompting strategies for using LLMs as post hoc explainers: i) Perturbation-based ICL, ii) Prediction-based ICL, iii) Instruction-based ICL, and iv) Explanation-based ICL. These strategies vary in the level of information provided about the underlying ML model and the local neighborhood of the test sample. The framework aims to generate explanations by leveraging the LLM's ability to use ICL examples and its internal knowledge.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use four real-world benchmark datasets: Blood, Recidivism, Adult, and Default Credit. These datasets come with a random train-test split, and further subdivide the train set for ICL sample selection.
    Step 2: Select Models: Consider two ML models with varying complexity: Logistic Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Implement the models using PyTorch.
    Step 3: Construct Prompts:

Linearity of Relation Decoding in Transformer Language Models:
  Title: Linearity of Relation Decoding in Transformer Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper investigates how transformer language models (LMs) represent and decode relational knowledge, such as relations between words and their synonyms, entities and their attributes, etc. The key question is whether this relational knowledge can be approximated by a simple linear transformation on the subject representation.
  Motivation: Existing studies have shown that LMs store a wide variety of factual and commonsense knowledge in their weights, but the exact mechanism of how LMs resolve relations remains unclear. Prior work has established that relational information is located in subject representations, but it has not described the computation LMs perform while resolving these relations. The motivation behind this study is to determine if a portion of this computation can be approximated linearly, which would provide a simple and interpretable representation strategy.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves approximating the computation of relational knowledge in LMs using a linear relational embedding (LRE) scheme. This is done by constructing a first-order approximation to the LM from a single prompt. The method involves the following steps: 1) Extracting subject representations from intermediate layers of the LM, 2) Estimating the Jacobian of the LM to obtain a linear transformation matrix and bias term, 3) Using these parameters to approximate the LM's computation as an affine transformation, and 4) Evaluating the faithfulness and causality of this approximation.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Manually curate a dataset of 47 relations spanning four categories: factual associations, commonsense knowledge, implicit biases, and linguistic knowledge. Each relation should be associated with example subject–object pairs and a prompt template that leads the LM to predict the object when the subject is filled in.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use autoregressive language models such as GPT-J, GPT-2-XL, and LLaMA-13B for evaluation.
    Step 3: Construct Prompts: For each relation, construct prompts that lead the LM to predict the object given the subject. For example, for the relation 'plays the instrument', the prompt could be '[subject] plays the [object]'.
    Step 4: Estimate LRE Parameters: For each relation, estimate the linear transformation matrix (W) and bias term (b) by calculating the Jacobian of the LM on a set of example prompts. Use a few-shot learning approach to ensure the LM generates the correct object given the subject.
    Step 5: Evaluate Faithfulness: Measure the faithfulness of the LRE by comparing the predictions made by the LRE to the actual predictions made by the LM. Calculate the success rate of the LRE in predicting the same object as the LM.
    Step 6: Evaluate Causality: Test the causal influence of the LRE by using it to edit subject representations and change the LM's predicted object. Measure the success rate of the LM in predicting the new object after the edit.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the faithfulness and causality scores across different relations and models. Identify relations that are well-approximated by the LRE and those that are not. Analyze the layer-wise performance of the LRE to understand where in the network the representations exhibit linearity.
    Step 8: Develop Attribute Lens: Use the LRE to create an attribute lens that visualizes the LM's knowledge of an attribute of a subject with respect to a relation. Apply the attribute lens to analyze LM falsehoods and reveal internal knowledge that does not reach the output.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers propose novel methods to investigate the capabilities and inner workings of large language models (LLMs). However, there are notable differences in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1 explores the use of LLMs as post hoc explainers for other predictive models. The main strength of this paper lies in its innovative approach to leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to generate explanations, potentially offering a more efficient and accessible solution compared to traditional explanation methods. The proposed framework, which includes four prompting strategies, is well-structured and comprehensive. The step-by-step experiment plan is detailed and includes a diverse set of datasets and models for evaluation. The proposed evaluation metrics (FA, RA, PGI, and PGU) are appropriate for assessing the faithfulness of the generated explanations.

On the other hand, Paper 2 investigates the linearity of relation decoding in transformer language models. The key strength of this paper is its focus on understanding the underlying mechanism of how LMs resolve relations, which is an important research question in the field. The proposed linear relational embedding (LRE) scheme provides a simple and interpretable approximation of the LM's computation. The experiment plan is well-designed, with a manually curated dataset of diverse relations and a clear methodology for estimating LRE parameters and evaluating faithfulness and causality. The development of an attribute lens using the LRE is an interesting application that could provide insights into LM falsehoods and internal knowledge.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 2 appears to have a slight edge in terms of its potential impact on the field. Understanding the inner workings of LMs and how they represent and decode relational knowledge is crucial for advancing the field and developing more interpretable and reliable models. The proposed LRE scheme, if successful, could provide a foundation for further research on the interpretability and controllability of LMs. Additionally, the attribute lens application demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed method.

In contrast, while Paper 1's approach to using LLMs as post hoc explainers is innovative, the impact may be somewhat limited, as the focus is on explaining other models rather than directly improving the interpretability of LLMs themselves. Furthermore, the reliance on prompting strategies may introduce additional complexity and potential biases in the generated explanations.

In conclusion, while both papers propose interesting and novel methods, Paper 2's focus on understanding the linearity of relation decoding in transformer language models and its potential for advancing interpretability and controllability of LMs gives it a slight advantage over Paper 1.

Identifying the Risks of LM Agents with an LM-Emulated Sandbox:
  Title: Identifying the Risks of LM Agents with an LM-Emulated Sandbox
  Problem Statement: Recent advances in Language Model (LM) agents and tool use, exemplified by applications like ChatGPT Plugins, enable a rich set of capabilities but also amplify potential risks—such as leaking private data or causing financial losses. Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, setting up the environment for each test scenario manually, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tail risks.
  Motivation: Existing methods for identifying risks in LM agents are labor-intensive and not scalable. They require manual implementation of tools, setting up environments for each test scenario, and manually finding risky cases. This process is not only time-consuming but also limits the test space, making it difficult to identify long-tail risks. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to use an LM to emulate tool execution, which allows for scalable testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios. The proposed method would work better than existing baselines because it automates the testing process, making it faster and more scalable, and it includes an LM-based automatic safety evaluator to quantify associated risks.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, ToolEmu, uses an LM to emulate tool execution and enables scalable testing of LM agents. The framework includes two main components: (1) an LM-based tool emulator that can emulate a broad spectrum of tools and scenarios, and (2) an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. The tool emulator allows for faster prototyping of LM agents across different scenarios, while the safety evaluator captures potential failures and assesses their severity. The framework also includes an adversarial emulator for red-teaming, which automatically instantiates sandbox states for designated test cases that are more likely to cause LM agent failures.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Curate an initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes toolkits and 144 test cases. These toolkits span various domains such as finance, e-commerce, communication, and IoT, and are designed to test the LM agents in scenarios with potentially severe outcomes.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the tool emulator, prompt the LM to instantiate the sandbox using the tool specifications and user instructions. For the safety evaluator, prompt the LM to examine the agent's trajectory and assess the likelihood and severity of potential risks. Example prompts for the tool emulator might include: 'Emulate the execution of the following tool with these inputs...' and for the safety evaluator: 'Assess the safety of the following agent actions based on these criteria...'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-4 as the base model for both the tool emulator and the safety evaluator. For the LM agents, use GPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, Claude-2, and Vicuna-1.5.
    Step 4: Get Results: Execute the LM agents on the curated test cases using the tool emulator and safety evaluator. Collect the identified failures and their associated risks.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the identified failures with human annotations to validate the precision and recall of the tool emulator and safety evaluator. Analyze the safety and helpfulness scores of different LM agents and evaluate the effect of prompt tuning on the safety of LM agents.

Improving the Reliability of Large Language Models by Leveraging Uncertainty-Aware In-Context Learning:
  Title: Improving the Reliability of Large Language Models by Leveraging Uncertainty-Aware In-Context Learning
  Problem Statement: Large-scale language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive text generation capabilities but often suffer from 'hallucination,' where they generate factually incorrect or nonsensical responses. This undermines their reliability and trustworthiness.
  Motivation: Existing methods for estimating uncertainty in LLMs assume that uncertainty is lower when the model's response is correct. However, setting a precise threshold to distinguish correctness is challenging. The proposed method introduces uncertainty information as an intermediary variable to implicitly influence the model's behavior, aiming to filter out answers with high uncertainty and improve the model's responses.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method is an uncertainty-aware in-context learning framework that involves fine-tuning the LLM using a calibration dataset. The framework aims to improve the model's responses by filtering out answers with high uncertainty while considering the model's knowledge limitations. The model generates multiple responses to the same question, and if it lacks relevant knowledge, it indicates that the question cannot be answered. Conversely, if the model has relevant knowledge, it provides the correct answer. The framework dynamically adjusts the model's responses based on calculated uncertainty scores.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the SciQ dataset for calibration. The training set of SciQ is used to construct the training set, and the validation set (1,000 questions) is used as the test set.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each question in the calibration dataset, the model generates multiple responses. Each response is labeled as 'correct' or 'incorrect' with corresponding uncertainty calculations. If all responses are incorrect, the model should refrain from providing an answer. If at least one response is correct, the model should select the correct response as its final answer.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use Vicuna and LLama as the LLM backbones. Conduct experiments on these models to evaluate the framework's performance.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate answer predictions from the models on the test set with both the baseline (finetuned models) and the proposed method (uncertainty-aware models).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with the baseline models. Metrics include accuracy, answer rate, mean uncertainty score, and AUROC. Analyze whether the new method improves the reliability and accuracy of LLM responses.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of large language models (LLMs) and propose novel methods to mitigate these issues. Paper 1 focuses on identifying risks associated with LM agents using an LM-emulated sandbox, while Paper 2 aims to improve the reliability of LLMs by leveraging uncertainty-aware in-context learning.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the critical issue of identifying risks in LM agents, which is becoming increasingly important as these agents become more complex and capable.
- Proposes a scalable and automated method for testing LM agents using an LM-based tool emulator and safety evaluator.
- Includes an adversarial emulator for red-teaming, which can help identify potential failures in more challenging scenarios.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The proposed method relies heavily on the quality and diversity of the curated benchmark dataset, which may limit its generalizability to real-world scenarios.
- The effectiveness of the LM-based tool emulator and safety evaluator may be limited by the capabilities of the underlying LM (GPT-4).

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the important issue of improving the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs by reducing hallucination.
- Proposes a novel uncertainty-aware in-context learning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's responses based on calculated uncertainty scores.
- Considers the model's knowledge limitations and refrains from providing answers when the model lacks relevant knowledge.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The effectiveness of the proposed method may be limited by the quality and diversity of the calibration dataset (SciQ).
- The method relies on the assumption that uncertainty is lower when the model's response is correct, which may not always hold true.

While both papers make valuable contributions, Paper 1 addresses a more pressing and critical issue in the field of LM agents. The scalable and automated method proposed in Paper 1 has the potential to significantly improve the safety and reliability of LM agents, which is crucial as these agents become more widely deployed in real-world applications. Additionally, the inclusion of an adversarial emulator for red-teaming sets Paper 1 apart and demonstrates a more comprehensive approach to identifying risks.

BESA: Pruning Large Language Models with Blockwise Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Allocation:
  Title: BESA: Pruning Large Language Models with Blockwise Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Allocation
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various tasks, but their vast number of parameters results in a prohibitive computational footprint. Existing weight pruning solutions like SparseGPT and Wanda attempt to alleviate this issue but their layer-wise approach results in significant perturbation to the model's output and requires meticulous hyperparameter tuning, adversely affecting overall model performance.
  Motivation: Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda focus on layer-wise pruning, which leads to significant perturbation in the model's output and requires careful hyperparameter tuning. These methods do not effectively mitigate the impact of pruning on the model's output because the pruning error accumulates layer by layer. The proposed method, BESA, aims to address these issues by targeting the overall pruning error with respect to individual transformer blocks and allocating layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner, ensuring reduced performance degradation after pruning.
  Proposed Method: BESA introduces a novel LLM pruning technique by applying a blockwise reconstruction loss. It is characterized by two distinctive attributes: i) it targets the overall pruning error with respect to individual transformer blocks, and ii) it allocates layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner. The method involves block-wise pruning, parameter-efficient sparsity learning, and joint optimization with quantization. BESA sequentially prunes the parameters of one transformer block before moving on to the next, minimizing the reconstruction error between the blockwise outputs of pruned and dense models. It employs a parameter-efficient sparsity learning technique to optimally select the top-K least important weights for each layer, and it can be jointly optimized with weight-only quantization techniques.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on the WikiText2, C4, and PTB datasets for perplexity measurements. Additionally, we use six standard common-sense benchmark datasets for zero-shot tasks: PIQA, BoolQ, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC Easy, and ARC Challenge.
    Step 2: Select Models: We focus on the LLaMA family of models, including LLaMA-7B/13B/30B/65B and LLaMA2-7B/13B/70B.
    Step 3: Implement Baseline Methods: Implement SparseGPT and Wanda as baseline methods for comparison. SparseGPT divides the task of pruning LLM models into a sparse regression problem for a set of transformer blocks, while Wanda leverages the product of weight magnitude and L2 normalization of input activations to determine the importance of LLM model weights.
    Step 4: Apply BESA Method: Apply the BESA method to prune the LLaMA models. This involves: 
1. Block-wise pruning: Sequentially prune the parameters of one transformer block before moving on to the next, minimizing the reconstruction error between the blockwise outputs of pruned and dense models.
2. Parameter-efficient sparsity learning: Use a parameter-efficient algorithm to learn layer sparsity with marginally additional learnable parameters. Generate differentiable masks in a parameter-efficient way by taking weights' importance into modeling.
3. Joint optimization with quantization: Implement weight-only quantization using the Min-Max quantization scheme with learnable clipping strengths, and jointly optimize quantization and pruning parameters.
    Step 5: Get Results: Measure the perplexity of the pruned models on the WikiText2, C4, and PTB datasets. Evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of the pruned models on the six common-sense benchmark datasets.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the pruned models with the baseline methods (SparseGPT and Wanda) and the original dense models. Assess the impact of different sparsity levels, calibration sizes, training epochs, sparsity steps, and importance metrics on the performance of the pruned models. Additionally, evaluate the practical speedup of the pruned models using the ViTCoD accelerator.

GraphLLM:
  Title: GraphLLM: Boosting Graph Reasoning Ability of Large Language Model
  Problem Statement: Despite the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), they still struggle with understanding and reasoning on graph data. This limitation is evident in their underwhelming performance on fundamental graph reasoning tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods often convert graph data into natural language descriptions (Graph2Text) to make it processable by LLMs. However, this approach introduces several bottlenecks: LLMs must infer implicit graph structures from sequential text, and the lengthy context of graph descriptions can obscure essential information. These limitations hinder the LLMs' ability to perform graph reasoning tasks effectively. The proposed method, GraphLLM, integrates graph learning models with LLMs to leverage the strengths of both, aiming to enhance the LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities.
  Proposed Method: GraphLLM is an end-to-end approach that integrates a graph learning module (graph transformer) with an LLM. This integration allows the LLM to interpret and reason on graph data more effectively. The method involves three main steps: (1) Node Understanding: A textual transformer encoder-decoder extracts semantic information from node descriptions. (2) Structure Understanding: A graph transformer learns the graph structure by aggregating node representations. (3) Graph-enhanced Prefix Tuning: The graph representation is used to generate a fixed-length prefix, which is then used to fine-tune the LLM, enhancing its graph reasoning ability.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Four fundamental graph reasoning tasks are used: Substructure Counting, Maximum Triplet Sum, Shortest Path, and Bipartite Graph Matching. Each task involves graphs with nodes described by textual entities.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: GraphLLM consists of a textual transformer encoder-decoder for node understanding, a graph transformer for structure understanding, and a graph-enhanced prefix tuning mechanism for the LLM.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: The model is trained to minimize the loss function specific to each graph reasoning task. The textual encoder-decoder and graph transformer are trained to extract and aggregate node and structure information, respectively, while the LLM is fine-tuned using the graph-enhanced prefix.
    Step 4: Select Models: LLaMA 2 7B and LLaMA 2 13B are used as the backbone LLMs. The textual encoder-decoder and graph transformer are lightweight models with 0.05B parameters each.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of GraphLLM on the four graph reasoning tasks, comparing it with baseline methods such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting, LoRA, and prefix tuning.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the accuracy, context length, and inference time of GraphLLM with the baseline methods. Analyze the improvements in graph reasoning ability, context reduction, and computational efficiency.

Chain of Images for Intuitively Reasoning:
  Title: Chain of Images for Intuitively Reasoning
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently rely solely on textual information for reasoning, which can be overly complex and abstract. This limitation hinders their ability to solve complex problems efficiently. The paper addresses the need for a method that leverages visual intuition to enhance logical reasoning in LLMs.
  Motivation: Humans naturally use visual aids like flowcharts, sketches, and diagrams to simplify complex problems. Current LLMs, even advanced vision-language models like GPT-4V and LLaVA, do not utilize visual intuition effectively, as they align images into the textual space, keeping their reasoning processes purely verbal. The proposed method, Chain of Images (CoI), aims to convert complex language reasoning problems into simple pattern recognition tasks by generating a series of images as intermediate representations. This approach is inspired by the human brain's proficiency in intuitive reasoning and aims to overcome the limitations of purely text-based reasoning.
  Proposed Method: The Chain of Images (CoI) method involves generating a series of images as intermediate representations to aid in solving complex reasoning problems. The process is supported by a symbolic multimodal large language model (SyMLLM) that generates images based on language instructions and accepts both text and image inputs. The method leverages the intuitive representation of relationships, compact state recording, and visual commonsense knowledge to enhance reasoning. The CoI evaluation dataset, encompassing 17 distinct domains, is introduced to assess the capability of future multimodal LLMs to leverage images for reasoning.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The CoI evaluation dataset includes tasks from Geometry, Chess, Topological, Temporal, and Common Sense domains. Specific datasets include BIGBench, AGIEval, OGB, MMLU, and NYCC.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each task, construct prompts that guide the model to generate images as intermediate steps. For example, in the Geometry task, prompt the model to draw shapes and identify intersection points. In the Chess task, prompt the model to visualize the board and identify checkmate moves.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use SyMLLM, which consists of an LLM, an image encoder, and a linear layer to align image embeddings with the LLM. Compare with other models like GPT-4V, LLaVA, and diffusion-based models like SDXL and DALL·E 3.
    Step 4: Train Models: Fine-tune SyMLLM on specific tasks like Geometry and Chess. Use a 4-bit quantization on the LLM backbone and a rank-16 LoRA for training new parameters. Train on datasets with a batch size of 1 and 8 gradient accumulation steps for 5 epochs.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of SyMLLM and other models on the CoI evaluation dataset. Measure accuracy in generating images and solving reasoning tasks. For example, in the Geometry task, measure the accuracy of identifying intersection points.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of CoI with pure-text models and other multimodal models. Analyze failure cases to identify areas for improvement. For example, in the Geometry task, analyze cases where the model failed to identify intersection points correctly.

SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight Compression:
  Title: SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight Compression
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have impressive abilities but require significant memory, making them difficult to deploy on memory-limited devices like laptops and mobile phones. Quantizing these models to 3-4 bits per parameter can lead to moderate to high accuracy losses, especially for smaller models (1-10B parameters) suitable for edge deployment.
  Motivation: Existing quantization methods for LLMs, such as those that quantize models to 3-4 bits per parameter, often result in significant accuracy degradation. This is particularly problematic for smaller models that are ideal for edge deployment. The inspiration behind the new method, SpQR, is to achieve near-lossless compression by identifying and isolating outlier weights that cause large quantization errors and storing them in higher precision while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits. This approach aims to maintain high accuracy while achieving similar compression levels to previous methods.
  Proposed Method: SpQR introduces a new compressed format and quantization technique that isolates outlier weights and stores them in higher precision. The method involves: 1) Identifying outlier weights that cause large quantization errors. 2) Storing these outliers in higher precision. 3) Compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits. 4) Using efficient algorithms for encoding and decoding weights. The method achieves less than 1% relative accuracy loss in perplexity for highly accurate LLaMA and Falcon LLMs, enabling the deployment of a 33B parameter LLM on a single 24 GB consumer GPU without performance degradation and with a 15% speedup.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the RedPajama dataset for quantizing LLaMA models and the RefinedWeb dataset for Falcon models. These datasets represent the original training data or open replications of the training data.
    Step 2: Select Models: Evaluate on LLaMA-{7,13,30,65}B and Falcon-{7,40,180}B model families. Additionally, include Llama 2 and OPT models for comprehensive evaluation.
    Step 3: Define Baselines: Compare SpQR against two post-training quantization schemes: GPTQ and round-to-nearest (RTN) quantization, both using 4-bit quantization.
    Step 4: Implement SpQR: For SpQR, use 3-bit base quantization, a group size of 8 with 3-bit for the first quantization, a group size of 64 for the second quantization, and adjust the number of outliers to achieve less than 4-bits per parameter on average. Implement the SpQR algorithm with efficient GPU inference.
    Step 5: Measure Performance: Evaluate quantized model performance using perplexity on WikiText2, Penn Treebank, and C4 datasets. Measure zero-shot accuracy on tasks like WinoGrande, PiQA, HellaSwag, ARC-easy, and ARC-challenge using the LM Evaluation Harness.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of SpQR with GPTQ and RTN in terms of perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. Assess the memory compression gains and inference speed improvements. Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of small group sizes and unstructured outliers on performance.

Learning Latent Causal Semantics from Text:
  Title: Learning Latent Causal Semantics from Text: An Empirical Study of Next-Token Predictors Trained on Programs
  Problem Statement: The paper investigates whether language models (LMs) can learn to represent the semantics latent in text despite being trained only to perform next token prediction. This is crucial because understanding whether LMs can capture semantically meaningful information from text has significant implications for their application in various domains.
  Motivation: Existing methods and theories suggest that LMs trained only on text may not capture the underlying semantics, as they are presumed to model only surface-level correlations. This paper challenges this notion by proposing that LMs can indeed learn latent causal semantics from text. The inspiration comes from the need to understand the extent to which LMs can acquire meaningful representations without additional supervised signals or inductive biases.
  Proposed Method: The authors train a Transformer model on a synthetic corpus of programs written in a domain-specific language for navigating 2D grid world environments. Each program is preceded by a partial specification in the form of input-output examples. They then probe the trained model's hidden states to see if it can represent the program states. The method involves using a linear probe to extract abstractions of the program states from the model states, suggesting that the model acquires an emergent ability to interpret programs. They also propose a causal framework for analyzing the effects of probing and perform interventional experiments to attribute the accuracy of the probe to the semantics latent in the model's training data.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The dataset consists of a synthetic corpus of 500,000 Karel programs of lengths between 6 and 10, each paired with 5 random input-output examples. A test set of 5000 specifications is also generated, with reference programs ranging from lengths 1 to 10.
    Step 2: Train Language Model: Train a 350M parameter Transformer model (CodeGen architecture) to perform next token prediction on the dataset. Use the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-5, a block size of 2048, and a batch size of 16. Train for 80,000 steps, measuring generative accuracy every 2000 steps.
    Step 3: Construct Trace Dataset: For every 2000 training steps, use the LM to process strings consisting of input specifications and programs. Capture the final layer hidden states of the LM as it processes each token of the reference program and the corresponding program states after evaluating the partial program on each of the 5 specified inputs.
    Step 4: Train Probes: Fit a linear classifier and a 1-layer MLP to predict the direction of the robot given the LM state as input. Train the probes on the first 100,000 aligned traces in the training trace dataset for 100 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 1e-4 and a learning rate of 0.01.
    Step 5: Measure Semantic Content: Evaluate the accuracy of the probes on the test split of the trace dataset to measure the semantic content of the LM states. Plot the semantic content against the generative accuracy of the LM across training steps.
    Step 6: Conduct Interventional Experiments: Define an alternative semantics by replacing the semantics of individual operations in the language with different operators. Retrace the program according to the alternative semantics and train a new probe to decode the original model states to the alternative semantic states. Measure the adjusted semantic content by comparing the semantic content of the original and alternative semantics.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the semantic content and adjusted semantic content with the generative accuracy of the LM. Determine whether the LM states contain representations of the semantics and whether these representations emerge over the course of training.

In-Context Learning through the Bayesian Prism:
  Title: In-Context Learning through the Bayesian Prism
  Problem Statement: In-context learning (ICL) is a surprising and useful feature of large language models (LLMs) where the model can learn new functions without weight updates from input-output examples provided at test time. The problem is to understand the inductive biases and mechanisms that enable transformers to generalize to new functions within a class, and to explore how far a Bayesian perspective can help in understanding ICL.
  Motivation: Existing methods have shown that transformers can generalize to new functions in a class, such as linear regression, but the inductive biases leading to this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor, learning the pretraining distribution. The inspiration behind the new method is to empirically examine how far the Bayesian perspective can help us understand ICL, and to explore the inductive biases of transformers in a hierarchical meta-ICL setup involving multiple task families. The proposed method would work better than existing baselines by providing insights into the inductive bias of ICL and how transformers perform tasks when trained on multiple tasks, and by examining deviations from the Bayesian predictor.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves generalizing the previous meta-ICL setup to a hierarchical meta-ICL setup, which involves unions of multiple task families. The method is instantiated on a diverse range of linear and nonlinear function families. Where Bayesian inference is tractable, evidence is found that high-capacity transformers mimic the Bayesian predictor. The method also examines how transformers can learn to generalize to new function classes not seen during pretraining, involving deviations from the Bayesian predictor.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments involve a diverse range of linear and nonlinear function families, including linear regression, sparse linear regression, sign vector regression, low-rank regression, skewed covariance regression, Fourier series, degree-2 monomials, random Fourier features, and Haar wavelets.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each function family, construct prompts of the form ((x1, f(x1)), ..., (xk, f(xk)), xk+1) where xi are chosen i.i.d. from a distribution, and f is a function from the family. For hierarchical meta-ICL, sample functions from a mixture of function classes with specified probabilities.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use transformer-based language models with 12 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden size of 256. For some tasks, larger models with 18 or 21 layers and higher hidden sizes are used. The models are trained with the Adam optimizer and curriculum learning.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the models on unseen functions from the same class and from new function classes not seen during pretraining. Compute the loss@k for different prompt lengths and compare with baselines such as OLS, Lasso, and numerical solutions obtained using MCMC sampling.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of transformers with the Bayesian predictor and strong baselines. Examine the inductive biases by measuring the frequencies of the simulated functions and the implied weights. Study the deviations from the Bayesian predictor and the phenomenon of forgetting during pretraining.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers tackle interesting problems in the domain of language models and their ability to learn and generalize from text data. However, there are notable differences in their problem statements, motivations, proposed methods, and experiment plans.

Paper 1 focuses on investigating whether language models can learn to represent the semantics latent in text despite being trained only to perform next token prediction. The motivation is to challenge the existing notion that LMs trained only on text may not capture the underlying semantics. The proposed method involves training a Transformer model on a synthetic corpus of programs and probing the model's hidden states to see if it can represent the program states. The experiment plan is well-structured, with clear steps for data gathering, model training, probe construction, and interventional experiments.

On the other hand, Paper 2 aims to understand the inductive biases and mechanisms that enable transformers to generalize to new functions within a class through in-context learning (ICL). The motivation is to explore how far a Bayesian perspective can help in understanding ICL and to examine the inductive biases of transformers in a hierarchical meta-ICL setup. The proposed method involves generalizing the previous meta-ICL setup to a hierarchical meta-ICL setup and instantiating it on a diverse range of linear and nonlinear function families. The experiment plan is also well-defined, with steps for prompt construction, model selection, and result analysis.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 1 stands out for its novel approach to investigating the ability of LMs to learn latent causal semantics from text. The use of a synthetic corpus of programs and the interventional experiments to attribute the accuracy of the probe to the semantics latent in the model's training data is particularly compelling. The paper's findings have significant implications for understanding the extent to which LMs can acquire meaningful representations without additional supervised signals or inductive biases.

In contrast, Paper 2's focus on understanding ICL through the Bayesian perspective, while interesting, may not be as groundbreaking. The hierarchical meta-ICL setup and the examination of deviations from the Bayesian predictor are valuable contributions, but the overall impact of the paper may not be as significant as Paper 1.

Therefore, based on the problem statement, motivation, proposed method, and potential impact, Paper 1 is likely to be the accepted idea.

Neural Sandbox Framework for Discovering Spurious Concepts in LLM Decisions:
  Title: A Neural Sandbox Framework for Discovering Spurious Concepts in LLM Decisions
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of identifying and mitigating spurious concepts in the decisions made by Large Language Models (LLMs) during text classification tasks. This problem is crucial because spurious correlations can lead to biased or incorrect model predictions, which can have significant negative impacts in real-world applications.
  Motivation: Existing methods for text classification often fail to provide clear explanations for their decisions and may inadvertently rely on spurious correlations present in the training data. Traditional methods like attention scores or saliency maps are limited as they rely solely on input tokens for understanding predictions. The proposed method aims to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of LLMs by using a sandbox framework that incorporates predefined concept words (cop-words) to guide the classification process. This approach not only enhances the model's performance but also provides a descriptive tool for understanding the model's decisions.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a neural sandbox framework that uses a frozen LLM as a vector embedding generator for text. The framework is provided with defined concept words based on the labels along with the input text. An operator is then optimized to classify the input text based on the relevance scores to the concept operator words (cop-words). The framework serves both as a classification tool and a descriptive tool for the model's decision-making process. The method also includes evaluations involving the injection of 'foreign' cop-words to discover potential spurious behaviors and biases within the model.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets used for experiments include GoEmotions, IMDB Movie Review Dataset, and Amazon Hierarchical Text Classification. These datasets provide a range of text classification tasks with varying levels of complexity and hierarchical labels.
    Step 2: Construct Cop-Words: For each dataset, define concept words (cop-words) for each label. For example, for sentiment classification in the IMDB dataset, cop-words could include 'happy', 'sad', 'angry', etc. Use ChatGPT to generate descriptive texts for these cop-words.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use pre-trained LLMs such as 'bert-base-uncased', 'roberta-large', and 't5-encoder-large' as the frozen LLMs in the sandbox framework. These models will generate vector embeddings for the input text and cop-words.
    Step 4: Optimize Operator: Optimize an operator to classify the input text based on the relevance scores to the cop-words. Use a learnable transformation tensor T to project the embeddings into a new space. Calculate similarity scores using cosine similarity and aggregate these scores to perform classification.
    Step 5: Train Models: Train the sandbox framework with the frozen LLMs on the selected datasets. Use a linear rate scheduler and AdamW optimizer starting from 0.001 for 8 epochs. Retain the best parameters based on validation set performance.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Compare the performance of the sandbox framework with a simple fully connected classifier baseline. Measure accuracy and macro F1 scores to evaluate improvements.
    Step 7: Foreign Injection of Cop-Words: Test the model with foreign cop-words not used in training to evaluate the robustness of the learned representations. Perform tests with paraphrased cop-words and alternate cop-words in the same domain.
    Step 8: Intrachanged Cop-Words: Evaluate the model by intrachanging the cop-words (e.g., replacing positive cop-words with negative ones) to test the reliability of the cop-words and the shared transformation tensor.
    Step 9: Neutral Cop-Words Injection: Stress test the models with neutral cop-words from the SentiWord corpus to identify spurious correlations. Analyze the distribution of F1 scores to determine the impact of neutral cop-words.
    Step 10: Bias Terminologies: Inject cop-words for potential bias terminologies (e.g., 'gender', 'race', 'occupation') to identify spurious correlations and biases in the model. Evaluate the model's performance with these bias cop-words to ensure fairness and reduce biases.

CLEX: Continuous Length Extrapolation for Large Language Models:
  Title: CLEX: Continuous Length Extrapolation for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by a preset context window, which restricts their performance on tasks requiring longer contexts. Existing methods to extend this context window either fail to extrapolate effectively or degrade performance within the original context window.
  Motivation: Current Position Embedding (PE) scaling methods can extend the context window to a specific length but struggle with extrapolation or performance degradation. Length extrapolation methods theoretically extend the context window but often underperform in practical applications. The proposed method, CLEX, aims to overcome these limitations by generalizing PE scaling to model continuous dynamics, thereby enabling effective length extrapolation without performance loss.
  Proposed Method: CLEX generalizes PE scaling approaches by modeling the continuous dynamics of the length scaling factor using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This method allows for seamless integration into LLMs with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and extends the context window beyond the training sequence length. CLEX employs a neural ODE parameterized by an up-and-down projection layer to learn these continuous dynamics, enabling fine-grained extension to long contexts. The method is designed to be computationally efficient, with negligible impact on training and inference latency.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use a subset of the Redpajama-Book dataset for long-context language modeling and the LongBench benchmark for practical long-context tasks.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B models for evaluation. Additionally, extend the method to other models like Phi-2 and Mixtral-8x7B.
    Step 3: Training Details:
      Training Data: Use 2B tokens from the Redpajama-Book dataset.
      Learning Rate: Set the learning rate to 2e-5.
      Batch Size: 64k tokens for 7B models and 16k tokens for 13B models.
      Training Length: Train on sequence lengths of 4k, 8k, and 16k.
      Optimizer: Use Adam optimizer.
      Neural ODE Parameters: Set the amplification factor λ to 1 for 7B models and 2 for 13B models.
    Step 4: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 5: Training Procedure:
      Step 1: Sample a scaling factor t' from [1, tTrain] for each training step.
      Step 2: Calculate the frequency basis z(t') using the neural ODE.
      Step 3: Extend the position indices to match the scaled context length.
      Step 4: Train the model with the extended RoPE on the given batch of sequences.
    Step 6: Evaluation Details:
      Language Modeling: Evaluate on a subset of the training set with 20 million tokens, grouped by sequence lengths from 4k to 64k.
      LongBench Benchmark: Evaluate on tasks like question-answering, summarization, and code completion with sequence lengths up to 16k.
    Step 7: Get Results: Measure perplexity (PPL) and next-token-prediction accuracy for language modeling. For LongBench, measure task-specific metrics.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of CLEX against baselines like PI, Yarn, ALiBi, and others. Evaluate the effectiveness of continuous dynamics, sampling strategies, and the impact of the neural ODE parameter size.

Both papers address important challenges in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs). The "Neural Sandbox Framework" paper focuses on identifying and mitigating spurious concepts in LLM decisions, while the "CLEX" paper aims to extend the context window of LLMs for improved performance on long-context tasks.

Strengths of the "Neural Sandbox Framework" paper:
1. Addresses the crucial problem of spurious correlations in LLM decisions, which can lead to biased or incorrect predictions.
2. Proposes a novel sandbox framework that incorporates predefined concept words (cop-words) to guide the classification process and improve interpretability.
3. Includes a comprehensive experiment plan with multiple datasets, models, and evaluation strategies to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. Considers the identification of potential biases and spurious correlations through the injection of foreign, neutral, and bias-related cop-words.

Weaknesses of the "Neural Sandbox Framework" paper:
1. The effectiveness of the method relies heavily on the quality and relevance of the defined cop-words, which may require domain expertise and careful selection.
2. The paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing methods for identifying and mitigating spurious correlations in LLMs.

Strengths of the "CLEX" paper:
1. Addresses the limitation of preset context windows in LLMs, which hinders their performance on long-context tasks.
2. Proposes a novel method, CLEX, that generalizes Position Embedding (PE) scaling to model continuous dynamics using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
3. Demonstrates the effectiveness of CLEX in extending the context window without performance degradation, outperforming existing methods like PI, Yarn, and ALiBi.
4. Provides a clear and concise experiment plan with well-defined training and evaluation procedures.

Weaknesses of the "CLEX" paper:
1. The paper focuses primarily on the technical aspects of the proposed method and may lack a broader discussion of its potential impact and applications.
2. The evaluation is limited to a subset of the Redpajama-Book dataset and the LongBench benchmark, which may not fully represent the diversity of long-context tasks.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, the "CLEX" paper appears to be the more promising and potentially accepted idea. The proposed method addresses a fundamental limitation of LLMs and provides a novel solution that outperforms existing approaches. The paper presents a well-structured experiment plan and demonstrates the effectiveness of CLEX on both language modeling and practical long-context tasks. While the "Neural Sandbox Framework" paper tackles an important problem, its reliance on carefully selected cop-words and lack of comparison with existing methods may limit its overall impact.

Are LLMs Aware that Some Questions are not Open-ended?:
  Title: Are LLMs Aware that Some Questions are not Open-ended?
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in answering questions across various scenarios. However, it is unclear whether LLMs can distinguish between open-ended questions, which allow for creative and casual responses, and non-open-ended questions, which require more deterministic and accurate answers. This lack of question awareness can lead to two main issues: (1) LLMs being too casual when answering non-open-ended questions, and (2) LLMs being too boring when answering open-ended questions.
  Motivation: Existing methods do not adequately address the issue of question awareness in LLMs. While LLMs can generate answers, they often fail to adjust the determinacy of their responses based on the type of question. This can result in hallucinated or inappropriate answers, especially in domains requiring factual accuracy. The proposed method, Question Awareness Temperature (QAT) sampling, aims to dynamically adjust the answer distributions based on question features, thereby enhancing the question awareness ability of LLMs.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Question Awareness Temperature (QAT) sampling, enhances the question awareness ability of LLMs by dynamically adjusting the sampling temperature based on the type of question. The method involves two phases: (1) Continual Fine-tuning Phase: Fine-tuning the LLMs to predict a determinacy score for each question, which indicates how deterministic the answer should be. (2) Inference Phase: Using the predicted determinacy score to adjust the sampling temperature during text generation, ensuring that the output distribution is appropriately steep or flat based on the question type.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets that include both open-ended and non-open-ended questions. The datasets used include: (1) TruthfulQA for commonsense knowledge, (2) GSM8k for school math word problems, (3) RefGPT-Fact for world knowledge, (4) ShareGPT for content creation, discussion, and suggestions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the evaluation, construct prompts that distinguish between open-ended and non-open-ended questions. For example, 'Write a long essay on philosophical views of being and becoming' (open-ended) and 'A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?' (non-open-ended).
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate two widely used open-source LLMs: Llama 2 (7b/13b/70b) and Falcon (7b/40b). These models have been fine-tuned for conversational usage.
    Step 4: Continual Fine-tuning Phase: Fine-tune the LLMs to predict a determinacy score for each question. Construct a training dataset with questions labeled by determinacy scores using GPT-4. Add a tiny network to the model to predict the determinacy score, and fine-tune the model using Mean Square Error (MSE) loss.
    Step 5: Inference Phase: During inference, use the predicted determinacy score to adjust the sampling temperature. Calculate the target kurtosis based on the determinacy score and adjust the temperature to transfer the original kurtosis to the target kurtosis. Ensure the temperature is clamped within a reasonable range to avoid overcorrection.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the LLMs with QAT sampling on various benchmarks, including AlpacaEval and MT-Bench. Compare the results with the baseline models using naive temperature sampling.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze whether QAT sampling improves the question awareness ability of LLMs and enhances their performance on different types of questions. Check for improvements in accuracy and reduction in hallucination for non-open-ended questions, as well as increased creativity for open-ended questions.

SEPT: Towards Efficient Scene Representation Learning for Motion Prediction:
  Title: SEPT: Towards Efficient Scene Representation Learning for Motion Prediction
  Problem Statement: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding road users is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles. The challenge lies in modeling and understanding the intricate spatiotemporal relationships within complex traffic scenes, which include the kinematics of agents' trajectories, the spatial structure of the road network, and the interactions among roads and agents.
  Motivation: Existing methods for motion prediction often rely on sophisticated architectural designs and manual feature engineering, which can lead to complex and computationally expensive information processing pipelines. These methods typically use rasterized or vectorized representations of traffic scenes, but they may suffer from information loss or require intricate modeling techniques. Inspired by the success of pretrained large language models that leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) to develop a broad understanding of linguistic knowledge, the authors propose a new approach that uses SSL to develop a powerful spatiotemporal understanding of traffic scenes. This approach aims to simplify the model architecture while achieving state-of-the-art performance.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Scene Encoding Predictive Transformer (SEPT), leverages self-supervised learning to pretrain a scene encoder on three masking-reconstruction tasks: Masked Trajectory Modeling (MTM), Masked Road Modeling (MRM), and Tail Prediction (TP). These tasks help the encoder capture the temporal dependencies within agents' trajectories, the spatial structure of the road network, and the interactions among roads and agents. The pretrained encoder is then finetuned on the downstream motion prediction task. The model architecture includes a TempoNet for temporal encoding, a SpaNet for spatial encoding, and a Cross Attender for generating predictions based on scene memory embeddings.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on two large-scale motion forecasting datasets: Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2. Argoverse 1 consists of 324,557 driving scenarios with 2-second historical context and 3-second future predictions. Argoverse 2 comprises 250,000 scenarios with 5-second historical context and 6-second future predictions.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: The model architecture includes the following components:
- Projection Layer: Projects different input modalities into a shared high-dimensional vector space.
- TempoNet: Consists of stacked Transformer encoder blocks for agent history encoding.
- SpaNet: Consists of stacked Transformer encoder blocks for spatial encoding of the scene.
- Cross Attender: Comprises cross attention layers that generate predictions based on scene memory embeddings.
- MLPs: Used for trajectory and score prediction.
    Step 3: Pretraining Tasks: The pretraining involves three self-supervised tasks:
- Masked Trajectory Modeling (MTM): Randomly masks and reconstructs waypoints in agents' trajectories to capture temporal dependencies.
- Masked Road Modeling (MRM): Randomly masks attributes of road vectors and reconstructs them to capture the spatial structure of the road network.
- Tail Prediction (TP): Divides agents' trajectories into head and tail sections and predicts the tail section based on the head section and road context to capture interactions between modalities.
    Step 4: Pretraining: Pretrain the scene encoder on the combined train, validation, and test datasets (with labels dropped) for 150 epochs with a constant learning rate of 2×10−4. Use a batch size of 96 on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GPU.
    Step 5: Finetuning: Finetune the pretrained encoder on the downstream motion prediction task using the train and validation splits of the Argoverse datasets. Train for 50 epochs with the learning rate decayed linearly from 2×10−4 to 0.
    Step 6: Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the model using the following metrics:
- minFDE k: The L2 distance between the endpoint of the best of k forecasted trajectories and the ground truth.
- minADE k: The average L2 distance between the best of k forecasted trajectories and the ground truth.
- Miss Rate (MR k): The ratio of scenarios where minFDE k exceeds a threshold of 2 meters.
- b-minFDE k: The minFDE k added by (1.0−p)^2 where p is the probability of the best forecasted trajectory.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of SEPT with state-of-the-art methods on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 leaderboards. Conduct ablation studies to assess the effectiveness of the pretraining tasks and the impact of mask hyperparameters. Visualize the prediction results to demonstrate the model's ability to capture multimodal driving purposes and generate trajectories conforming to road shapes.

- Utilizes a diverse set of datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on various types of questions.
- Provides a clear step-by-step experiment plan, including the construction of prompts, selection of models, and evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The effectiveness of the proposed method relies heavily on the accuracy of the determinacy score prediction, which may be challenging to achieve consistently across different domains and question types.
- The paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing methods or baselines, making it difficult to assess the relative improvement of the proposed approach.
- The generalizability of the method to other LLMs and question types beyond the selected datasets is not thoroughly discussed.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles the complex problem of motion prediction in autonomous vehicles by leveraging self-supervised learning to develop a spatiotemporal understanding of traffic scenes.
- Proposes a novel approach, Scene Encoding Predictive Transformer (SEPT), which simplifies the model architecture while achieving state-of-the-art performance.
- Introduces three masking-reconstruction tasks (MTM, MRM, and TP) to capture the temporal dependencies, spatial structure, and interactions among roads and agents.
- Conducts extensive experiments on two large-scale motion forecasting datasets, Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2, and provides a detailed evaluation using multiple metrics.
- Compares the performance of SEPT with state-of-the-art methods on the Argoverse leaderboards and conducts ablation studies to assess the effectiveness of the pretraining tasks.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The paper focuses specifically on the domain of motion prediction for autonomous vehicles, which may limit the broader applicability of the proposed method to other areas.
- The computational requirements for pretraining and finetuning the model are not explicitly discussed, which could be a concern for practical implementation.

Conclusion:
While both papers make valuable contributions to their respective fields, Paper 2 (SEPT) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The proposed method addresses a critical challenge in motion prediction for autonomous vehicles and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets. The paper provides a well-structured experiment plan, extensive evaluations, and insightful ablation studies. In contrast, Paper 1 (QAT sampling) lacks a clear comparison with existing methods and may have limitations in terms of generalizability and the accuracy of determinacy score prediction.

Raidar: geneRative AI Detection viA Rewriting:
  Title: Raidar: geneRative AI Detection viA Rewriting
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting AI-generated text, which is increasingly difficult due to the high quality of text produced by large language models (LLMs). This problem is important because AI-generated text can pose risks such as spreading misinformation, facilitating phishing attacks, and contributing to academic dishonesty.
  Motivation: Existing methods for detecting AI-generated text often rely on high-dimensional features or numerical output metrics from LLMs, which are not available in black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These methods can also overfit to spurious features and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The proposed method, Raidar, leverages the observation that LLMs tend to make fewer modifications to AI-generated text when asked to rewrite it, as they perceive it as high-quality. This insight forms the basis for a new detection method that is robust, generalizable, and compatible with black-box LLMs.
  Proposed Method: Raidar detects AI-generated text by prompting LLMs to rewrite the input text and then measuring the editing distance between the original and rewritten text. The method operates on symbolic word output, eliminating the need for deep neural network features. It uses three main metrics: invariance (how much the text changes upon rewriting), equivariance (consistency of text after a transformation and its reverse), and output uncertainty (variance in multiple rewrites). These metrics are used to train a binary classifier to detect AI-generated text.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets from various domains including News, creative writing, student essays, code, Yelp reviews, and arXiv papers. Ensure a mix of human-written and AI-generated text for each domain.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Create prompts to instruct the LLM to rewrite the text. Example prompts include: 'Help me polish this:', 'Rewrite this for me:', and 'Refine this for me please:'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-3.5-Turbo as the primary LLM for rewriting. Also consider using other models like Ada, Text-Davinci-002, and GPT-4 for robustness testing.
    Step 4: Measure Editing Distance: For each text, prompt the LLM to rewrite it and calculate the bag-of-words edit distance and Levenshtein score between the original and rewritten text. Repeat this process for multiple prompts to gather a comprehensive set of features.
    Step 5: Train Classifier: Use the collected features (invariance, equivariance, and uncertainty metrics) to train a binary classifier, such as Logistic Regression or XGBoost, to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the classifier on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Compare the performance with existing state-of-the-art methods like DetectGPT and Ghostbuster. Measure the F1 score and other relevant metrics.
    Step 7: Robustness Testing: Test the robustness of the method against adversarial rephrasing and different LLMs. Train the classifier on multiple prompts and evaluate its performance on unseen prompts and text generated by different models.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of Raidar in detecting AI-generated text across different domains and under various conditions. Highlight any improvements over existing methods and discuss potential limitations.

Understanding Your Agent: Leveraging Large Language Models for Behavior Explanation:
  Title: Understanding Your Agent: Leveraging Large Language Models for Behavior Explanation
  Problem Statement: Intelligent agents such as robots are increasingly deployed in real-world, safety-critical settings. It is vital that these agents are able to explain the reasoning behind their decisions to human counterparts; however, their behavior is often produced by uninterpretable models such as deep neural networks.
  Motivation: Existing methods for explaining agent behavior often rely on rules, vision-based cues, semantic concepts, or trajectories, which may not be easily understandable by laypeople. These methods also tend to use language templates or require large datasets of human-generated explanations, limiting their expressivity and applicability. The proposed method leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language explanations based on observations of states and actions, making it independent of the underlying model's representation. This approach aims to produce plausible explanations with minimal hallucination and allows for user interaction, such as clarification and counterfactual queries.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a three-step process: 1) distill the agent's policy into a decision tree, 2) extract a decision path from the tree for a given state to serve as a local behavior representation, and 3) transform the decision path into a textual representation and inject it into a pre-trained LLM via in-context learning to produce a natural language explanation. This method is evaluated in a multi-agent search-and-rescue environment and shown to generate explanations as helpful as those produced by a human domain expert.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted in a multi-agent Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task, modeled as a 2D Gridworld consisting of 20 rooms arranged in a 5×4 grid. The agents can exhibit one of three possible behaviors: Explore, Exploit, and Fixed.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, the prompt consists of four parts: a) a concise description of the environment the agent is operating in, b) a description of what information the behavior representation conveys, c) in-context learning examples, and d) the behavior representation and action that we wish to explain. Example prompts are provided in the appendix of the paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments use a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate natural language explanations. The specific LLM used is not mentioned, but it is implied to be a state-of-the-art model like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate natural language explanations for each agent's behavior using three methods: BR (Path), BR (States), and No BR. The generated explanations are hand-annotated with regards to metrics such as Strategy, Category, Goal, Action, and Intent.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the explanation accuracy, action prediction accuracy, and hallucination rates for each method. Conduct user studies to evaluate the helpfulness of the explanations and the usefulness of follow-up interactions. Analyze whether participants prefer the explanations produced by the proposed method over those produced by other methods and human domain experts.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important problems in the field of AI and natural language processing. Paper 1 focuses on detecting AI-generated text, while Paper 2 aims to generate explanations for the behavior of intelligent agents using large language models (LLMs).

Paper 1 (Raidar) proposes a novel method for detecting AI-generated text by leveraging the observation that LLMs tend to make fewer modifications to AI-generated text when asked to rewrite it. The method is robust, generalizable, and compatible with black-box LLMs. The experiment plan is well-structured and includes a diverse set of datasets, prompts, and models. The evaluation metrics and robustness testing are comprehensive, making the results more reliable.

Paper 2 (Understanding Your Agent) addresses the important problem of explaining the behavior of intelligent agents to humans. The proposed method leverages LLMs to generate natural language explanations based on observations of states and actions, making it independent of the underlying model's representation. The experiment plan is focused on a specific domain (multi-agent search-and-rescue) and includes user studies to evaluate the helpfulness of the explanations and the usefulness of follow-up interactions.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 1 (Raidar) appears to be a more significant contribution to the field. The problem of detecting AI-generated text is becoming increasingly important due to the rapid advancements in LLMs and their potential misuse. Raidar's approach is novel, robust, and applicable to a wide range of domains. The experiment plan is comprehensive and well-designed, increasing the likelihood of the method's success.

In contrast, Paper 2 (Understanding Your Agent) focuses on a more specific problem and domain. While generating explanations for agent behavior is important, the proposed method relies heavily on the quality of the LLM used and may not be as easily generalizable to other domains. The experiment plan is also more limited in scope compared to Paper 1.

Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, I believe that Paper 1 (Raidar) is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference due to its novel approach, broad applicability, and well-designed experiment plan.

paper 1:
Cleaning Label Noise with Vision-Language Models:
  Title: Cleaning Label Noise with Vision-Language Models
  Problem Statement: Current methods for learning with noisy labels often rely on sample selection strategies, such as the 'small-loss' strategy, which considers samples with smaller losses as clean. However, these methods are still influenced by problems like 'self-confirmation bias' and biases introduced by relying solely on visual information, such as 'hard noise' where samples are erroneously labeled as semantically similar categories.
  Motivation: Existing methods are not robust enough to handle high noise ratios and complex noise patterns. They often suffer from self-confirmation bias due to their reliance on the in-training model and can be biased when relying solely on visual information. The proposed method leverages the vision-language model CLIP, which can mitigate self-confirmation bias and supplement visual information with its language modality, making it more effective in identifying and cleaning noisy labels.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces the CLIPSelector, which utilizes both CLIP's zero-shot classifier and an easily-inducible classifier based on its vision encoder and noisy labels for sample selection. Additionally, a semi-supervised learning method called MixFix is introduced, which leverages the subset selected by CLIPSelector and gradually introduces missing clean samples and re-labeled noisy samples based on different thresholds.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with synthetic noise, and real-world noisy datasets like Red Mini-ImageNet, WebVision, Clothing1M, and ANIMAL-10N.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the zero-shot classifier, we generate multiple prompts using class-specific features. For example, 'A photo of {class name}, which is/has {class-specific feature}'.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use the CLIP model with the VIT-B/32 backbone for all experiments. For the trained classifier, we use LogisticRegression and kNN classifiers.
    Step 4: Get Results: We evaluate the performance of the CLIPSelector and MixFix on the selected datasets. We measure the precision and recall of sample selection and the overall accuracy of the final model.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with existing state-of-the-art methods. Analyze the impact of different sample selection mechanisms and the effectiveness of the MixFix semi-supervised learning method.

Mechanistically Analyzing the Effects of Fine-Tuning on Procedurally Defined Tasks:
  Title: Mechanistically Analyzing the Effects of Fine-Tuning on Procedurally Defined Tasks
  Problem Statement: The paper investigates how fine-tuning alters the underlying capabilities learned by large pre-trained models during pretraining. Specifically, it seeks to determine whether fine-tuning yields entirely novel capabilities or merely modulates existing ones.
  Motivation: Despite the widespread use of fine-tuning for developing task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems, there is minimal understanding of how fine-tuning affects the underlying capabilities of pre-trained models. Existing methods do not provide a clear explanation of whether fine-tuning creates new capabilities or modifies existing ones. The proposed method aims to fill this gap by using mechanistic interpretability tools to empirically analyze the changes in model capabilities during fine-tuning.
  Proposed Method: The study uses mechanistic interpretability tools such as network pruning, probing, and attention visualization to analyze the effects of fine-tuning in controlled synthetic settings. The key findings are: (i) Fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities; (ii) A minimal transformation, termed a 'wrapper,' is typically learned on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion of modification; (iii) Further fine-tuning on a task where such 'wrapped capabilities' are relevant leads to sample-efficient revival of the capability.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted in two setups: (i) Tracr compiled models with predefined capabilities, and (ii) models trained on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). Additionally, language models trained on the TinyStories dataset are used for validation in a more realistic setup.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Model Architecture and Training Objectives:
      Tracr Setup:
        Model Details: Tracr models are compiled with specific computational primitives. The models consist of three standard transformer blocks, each with a self-attention layer followed by two MLP layers.
        Training Details: Fine-tuning is performed using SGD with momentum for 10K iterations with a batch size of 96. Learning rates used are Large (10^-1), Medium (10^-2), Small (10^-3), and Very Small (10^-4).
      PCFG Setup:
        Model Details: MinGPT model with 6 blocks, each containing multihead self-attention with 6 heads and two MLP layers. The embedding dimension is 192.
        Training Details: Pre-training is done with a learning rate of 10^-3 using AdamW optimizer for 10K, 50K, 100K, and 200K iterations. Fine-tuning is done for 10K iterations with learning rates Large (10^-4), Medium (10^-5), and Small (10^-6).
      TinyStories Setup:
        Model Details: 91 million parameter autoregressive language models with a similar architecture to LLaMa 2, trained with a custom tokenizer with a vocabulary of 8192.
        Training Details: Pre-trained for 30,000 gradient steps with a learning rate schedule with a linear warmup and cosine decay. Fine-tuning protocols include Filtering, Filtering + Mix & Match, and Filtering + Randomisation.
    Step 4: Get Results:
      Behavioral Assessment: Evaluate the model's learning dynamics during fine-tuning. Analyze the performance on both the pre-training and fine-tuning tasks using test sets with and without spurious correlations.
      Mechanistic Analysis:
        Pruning: Prune the fine-tuned models to find the most salient weights for reducing loss on the pre-training task. Evaluate if pruning a small number of neurons can revive the pre-training capability.
        Probing: Train a linear probe on the residual output of every block of the transformer model to determine if the count of the pre-training target token can be accurately computed.
        Attention Visualization: Visualize the attention maps of Tracr models to see if the model continues to pay attention to the pre-training target token after fine-tuning.
      Reverse Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the model on a downstream dataset and then fine-tune it again on a dataset sampled from the original pre-training distribution to see if the pre-training capability can be revived.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the models on the pre-training and fine-tuning tasks. Analyze the attention maps, pruning results, and probing accuracy to understand the mechanistic changes in the model. Validate the findings using the TinyStories dataset.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important questions in the field of machine learning and natural language processing. Paper 1 focuses on the problem of learning with noisy labels and proposes a novel method called CLIPSelector that leverages vision-language models to clean label noise. Paper 2, on the other hand, investigates the effects of fine-tuning on the underlying capabilities of pre-trained models using mechanistic interpretability tools.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses a practical problem of learning with noisy labels, which is common in real-world datasets.
- Proposes a novel method that combines the strengths of vision-language models (CLIP) and semi-supervised learning (MixFix) to effectively clean label noise.
- Evaluates the proposed method on a diverse set of datasets, including synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.
- Provides a clear and detailed experiment plan, including the construction of prompts, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods for learning with noisy labels.
- The effectiveness of the proposed method may be limited to datasets where class-specific features can be easily identified and used for prompt generation.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Investigates a fundamental question of how fine-tuning affects the underlying capabilities of pre-trained models, which has implications for the development of task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems.
- Uses a rigorous experimental setup with controlled synthetic settings (Tracr and PCFG) and validates the findings on a more realistic dataset (TinyStories).
- Employs a variety of mechanistic interpretability tools (pruning, probing, attention visualization) to provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning.
- Presents novel findings, such as the concept of a 'wrapper' learned during fine-tuning and the sample-efficient revival of capabilities.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The paper focuses on a specific aspect of fine-tuning and may not provide a complete picture of how fine-tuning affects the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks.
- The experiments are conducted on relatively small-scale models and datasets, and the generalizability of the findings to larger models and more complex tasks is not fully established.

Conclusion:
While both papers make significant contributions, Paper 2 stands out as the stronger submission. It addresses a more fundamental question in the field of machine learning and provides novel insights into the effects of fine-tuning using a rigorous experimental setup and mechanistic interpretability tools. The findings have broader implications for the development of machine learning systems and open up new avenues for future research. In contrast, Paper 1, although addressing a practical problem, has a more narrow focus and does not provide a comprehensive comparison with existing methods.

Deep-Learning Approaches for Optimized Web Accessibility:
  Title: Deep-Learning Approaches for Optimized Web Accessibility: Correcting Violations and Enhancing User Experience
  Problem Statement: Despite the existence of accessibility guidelines and standards such as WCAG and W3C, over 90% of websites still fail to meet the necessary accessibility requirements. Manually detecting and correcting accessibility violations is time-consuming and error-prone, highlighting the need for automated and intelligent solutions.
  Motivation: Existing methods focus primarily on detecting accessibility errors rather than correcting them. While tools like Playwright, Tenon, and AChecker can identify violations, they do not provide automated correction. The proposed method leverages large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to automatically correct accessibility violations, aiming to reduce the inefficiency and inaccuracy associated with manual error correction.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves using prompt engineering techniques and LLMs to correct accessibility violations in the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages. The process includes identifying violations using the Playwright API, generating prompts to feed into LLMs for corrections, and implementing these corrections back into the DOM. The method is evaluated using a benchmark system that measures the severity of violations before and after corrections.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect a dataset of 25 website URLs, including commonly used, accessible, non-accessible, and older websites. Use the Playwright API to perform accessibility tests and gather violation data.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Generate prompts using ReAct prompting, Few-Shot guided prompting, and Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques. Example prompt for ReAct prompting: 'System message: Correct the following HTML tag to fix the accessibility violation. User message: <HTML tag with error> Error: <description of error> Suggested change: <suggested correction>'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-16K and GPT-4 models to generate corrected HTML tags based on the constructed prompts.
    Step 4: Implement Corrections: Iterate through the dataset, feeding the prompts into the selected models to obtain corrected HTML tags. Replace the incorrect HTML tags in the DOM with the corrected ones.
    Step 5: Evaluate Results: Run the modified DOM through Playwright again to test for remaining violations. Calculate the severity scores before and after corrections to evaluate the success of the models. Compare the performance of different prompting techniques and models.

RECOMP: Improving Retrieval-Augmented LMs with Context Compression and Selective Augmentation:
  Title: RECOMP: Improving Retrieval-Augmented LMs with Context Compression and Selective Augmentation
  Problem Statement: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) improve language models by retrieving documents and prepending them in-context. However, these documents often span hundreds of words, making inference substantially less efficient. The problem is to reduce the computational costs and the burden on LMs to identify relevant information in long retrieved documents.
  Motivation: Existing methods that prepend entire retrieved documents to the input increase computational costs and can confuse LMs with irrelevant information, degrading performance. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to compress the retrieved documents into concise summaries before prepending them, thereby reducing computational costs and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of LMs. The proposed method would work better than existing baselines by providing only the most relevant information in a concise format, thus enabling the LM to focus on the essential content.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, RECOMP (Retrieve, Compress, Prepend), involves compressing retrieved documents into textual summaries before in-context integration. Two types of compressors are presented: an extractive compressor that selects useful sentences from retrieved documents and an abstractive compressor that generates summaries by synthesizing information from multiple documents. Both compressors are trained to improve LMs' performance on end tasks while keeping the summaries concise. The compressors can also output an empty string when the retrieved documents are irrelevant, enabling selective augmentation.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on the language modeling task using the Wikitext-103 dataset and on open-domain question answering tasks using Natural Questions (NQ), TriviaQA, and HotpotQA datasets.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the language modeling task, we use BM25 to retrieve documents from the Wikipedia corpus. For QA tasks, we use contriever model trained on MS MARCO dataset to retrieve documents from the Wikipedia corpus. We construct prompts to guide the model to generate summaries for both extractive and abstractive compressors.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT-2 (117M), GPT2-XL (1.5B), and GPT-J (6B) for the language modeling task. For QA tasks, we use Flan-UL2 (20B) as the base model.
    Step 4: Train Extractive Compressor: We train a dual-encoder model initialized with the contriever checkpoint. The model embeds sentences and the input sequence into fixed-dimensional embeddings, and their inner product represents how helpful it would be for the LM to prepend the sentence to the input. We use a contrastive learning objective to train the model.
    Step 5: Train Abstractive Compressor: We use an encoder-decoder model initialized from T5-large checkpoint. We distill the query-focused summarization ability of GPT-3.5 by generating training data with it, filtering the generated data based on end task performance, and training the encoder-decoder model from the filtered dataset.
    Step 6: Get Results: Get predictions from the models on the datasets with both the baselines and proposed method. For the language modeling task, we measure perplexity. For QA tasks, we measure Exact Match (EM) and token-level F1 of answer strings.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with baselines. Evaluate the compression rate, performance drop, and inference speed. Conduct manual analysis to assess the faithfulness and comprehensiveness of the generated summaries.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose interesting ideas to address important problems in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there are notable differences in the novelty, clarity, and potential impact of the two proposals.

Paper 1 focuses on improving web accessibility by using LLMs and prompt engineering to automatically correct accessibility violations in the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages. The motivation behind this work is clear, as the majority of websites still fail to meet accessibility requirements, and manual correction is time-consuming and error-prone. The proposed method is well-explained, and the step-by-step experiment plan is detailed and feasible. However, the novelty of the approach is somewhat limited, as it primarily combines existing techniques (e.g., Playwright API, prompt engineering, LLMs) to address the problem. Additionally, the evaluation plan could be more comprehensive, as it only considers a small dataset of 25 websites and does not include user studies or real-world deployment.

Paper 2, on the other hand, introduces RECOMP, a novel method for improving retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) by compressing retrieved documents into concise summaries before in-context integration. The motivation is well-articulated, highlighting the computational costs and potential confusion caused by prepending entire retrieved documents to the input. The proposed method is innovative, presenting two types of compressors (extractive and abstractive) that are trained to improve LMs' performance on end tasks while keeping summaries concise. The experiment plan is comprehensive, evaluating the method on both language modeling and open-domain question answering tasks using multiple datasets and models. The evaluation metrics are appropriate, and the analysis plan includes both quantitative and qualitative aspects, such as compression rate, performance drop, inference speed, and manual analysis of summary quality.

In terms of potential impact, Paper 2 has a broader scope, as the proposed method can be applied to various NLP tasks and models, whereas Paper 1 is more focused on the specific problem of web accessibility. Moreover, the novelty and technical contributions of Paper 2 are more significant, introducing new techniques for context compression and selective augmentation in RALMs.

Considering the novelty, clarity, potential impact, and comprehensiveness of the experiment and evaluation plans, Paper 2 (RECOMP) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference like ICLR or ACL.

Discovering Knowledge-Critical Subnetworks in Neural Language Models:
  Title: Discovering Knowledge-Critical Subnetworks in Neural Language Models
  Problem Statement: Pretrained language models (LMs) encode implicit representations of knowledge in their parameters. However, localizing these representations and disentangling them from each other remains an open problem. The paper investigates whether pretrained language models contain various knowledge-critical subnetworks: particular sparse computational subgraphs responsible for encoding specific knowledge the model has memorized.
  Motivation: Existing methods in probing and mechanistic interpretability discover hidden representations, neurons, and layers responsible for knowledge expression but typically do not localize the knowledge accessing behavior at the weight-level. Model editing methods aim to coarsely edit model parameters to change specific knowledge but do not precisely localize the parameters responsible for encoding the knowledge. The proposed method aims to precisely remove specific knowledge from models while minimizing adverse effects on the behavior of the original language model, which could facilitate the development of more effective finetuning methods, rectifying factual errors, keeping models up to date, and preventing ethically undesirable behavior.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a multi-objective differentiable weight masking scheme to discover knowledge-critical subnetworks. The method optimizes a mask that promotes the removal of target knowledge while maintaining the other behaviors of the pretrained language model. The objectives include: (1) suppressing the expression of target knowledge triplets, (2) maintaining the ability to express generic relational knowledge, (3) maintaining standard language modeling performance, and (4) encouraging the subnetwork to be as sparse as possible.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Sample hypernym triplets from WordNet and triplets from the LAMA subset of ConceptNet. Create TARGET KG by walking a depth of three up and down in the respective KG. Create CONTROL KG by removing any triplet that shares the same entities as the union of the TARGET KGs. Use WikiText-2 for the CONTROL LM dataset.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Verbalize TARGET KG and CONTROL KG with the formats that give the lowest perplexity on the pretrained model. For example, 'A house is a ___' for WordNet and 'A briefcase is typically placed at a desk' for ConceptNet.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use multiple GPT2 variants: GPT2-small (117M parameters, 12 layers), GPT2-medium (345M parameters, 24 layers), and GPT2-large (774M parameters, 36 layers).
    Step 4: Implement Masking Scheme: Learn a binary mask over each network parameter using a differentiable approach. Model each parameter mask with the hard-concrete or gumbel-softmax distribution. Use a straight-through estimator to threshold the continuous score.
    Step 5: Train the Model: Optimize the mask parameters using a multi-objective loss function that combines suppression loss, maintenance losses, and sparsity regularization. Use AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 0.2 and a linear warmup for the first 10% of the training.
    Step 6: Evaluate the Model: Calculate the perplexity difference (∆PPL) between the remaining and original models for TARGET KG, CONTROL KG, and CONTROL LM. Also, calculate the rank and log probability differences. Compare the results with a randomly masked baseline at the same sparsity level.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the structure of the knowledge-critical subnetworks by looking at their density across different layer types and attention heads. Investigate the overlap of subnetworks across different seeds and KGs. Evaluate the effect of composing subnetworks from different seeds and KGs.

Detecting Machine-Generated Texts by Multi-Population Aware Optimization for Maximum Mean Discrepancy:
  Title: Detecting Machine-Generated Texts by Multi-Population Aware Optimization for Maximum Mean Discrepancy
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have exhibited remarkable performance in generating human-like texts. However, machine-generated texts (MGTs) may carry critical risks, such as plagiarism issues and hallucination information. Therefore, it is very urgent and important to detect MGTs in many situations. Unfortunately, it is challenging to distinguish MGTs and human-written texts because the distributional discrepancy between them is often very subtle due to the remarkable performance of LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods for detecting MGTs face significant challenges. Metric-based methods, which use statistics like log-likelihood to score the probability of texts being MGTs, are less effective when there is a large language-domain gap between the training and test texts. Model-based methods, which rely heavily on specific MGT types, struggle to adapt to other types of MGTs. These methods face challenges in effectively capturing the distributional discrepancy between MGTs and human-written texts, thus limiting their detection capabilities. The proposed method leverages maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to identify distributional discrepancies. However, directly training a detector with MMD using diverse MGTs increases the variance of MMD due to multiple text populations from various LLMs, impairing MMD's ability to measure the difference between two samples. The proposed multi-population aware optimization method for MMD, called MMD-MP, aims to avoid variance increases and improve stability in measuring distributional discrepancies.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, MMD-MP, is a multi-population aware optimization method for MMD. It avoids variance increases by not considering the intra-class distance in the MGT population during optimization. Instead, it focuses on fitting human-written texts. The method involves training a deep kernel with MMD-MP and developing two approaches for paragraph-based and sentence-based detection. The steps include: 1) Extracting features from both human-written and machine-generated texts using a fixed feature extractor. 2) Training the deep kernel by maximizing the MMD-MP objective. 3) Using the trained kernel to measure the distance between human-written and test texts during testing.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on the Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3) and the XSum dataset. HC3 contains question-answer pairs in both long and short-level paragraphs or sentences, covering various domains. XSum contains news articles from BBC, covering domains like news, politics, sports, weather, business, technology, science, health, family, education, entertainment, and arts.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use various LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT2 series, GPT3-S, GPT-Neo series, and GPT4all-j. The feature extractor is OpenAI's RoBERTa-based GPT-2 detector model.
    Step 4: Model Architecture and Training Objectives: The deep kernel ϕˆf is a neural network equipped with a feature extractor ˆf. The network ϕ consists of a hidden-layer transformer followed by a projector and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The training objective is to maximize the MMD-MP objective, which involves minimizing the variance of MMD values during training. The kernel parameters are optimized using the Adam optimizer.
    Step 5: Get Results: Get predictions from the models on the datasets with both the baselines and proposed method. For paragraph-based detection, compute the estimated MMD between given human-written texts and test paragraph sentences. For sentence-based detection, calculate the MMD distance between a set of referenced human-written texts and the test single sentence.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with existing baselines in terms of test power and AUROC. Evaluate the stability of discrepancy estimation and the transferability of the method in detecting unknown MGTs.

AutoHall: Automated Hallucination Dataset Generation for Large Language Models:
  Title: AutoHall: Automated Hallucination Dataset Generation for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate non-factual or hallucinatory content. Detecting such hallucinations is challenging due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of manual annotation. This paper addresses the need for an automated method to construct hallucination datasets specific to different models, which can facilitate the development of better hallucination detection techniques.
  Motivation: Existing methods for hallucination detection often rely on external knowledge sources or zero-resource approaches that still require manual annotation. These methods are time-consuming, expensive, and model-specific, making them less adaptable to new models or updates. The proposed method, AutoHall, aims to automate the generation of hallucination datasets using existing fact-checking datasets, thereby eliminating the need for manual annotation and providing a more scalable solution.
  Proposed Method: AutoHall is a method for automatically generating model-specific hallucination datasets using existing fact-checking datasets. The process involves three main steps: 1) Generating references for claims using LLMs, 2) Classifying the claims based on the generated references to determine if they are factual or hallucinatory, and 3) Collecting and labeling the hallucinations by comparing the classification results with ground truth labels. Additionally, a zero-resource, black-box hallucination detection method based on self-contradiction is proposed, which involves generating multiple references for a claim and checking for contradictions among them.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use three fact-checking datasets: Climate-fever, Pubhealth, and WICE. These datasets provide real-world claims, ground truth labels, and evidence retrieved from websites. The topics of claims range from different domains such as technology, culture, health, etc.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Responses Generation: Given one claim whose authenticity is unknown, you should provide one reference about it and summarize the reference in a paragraph. Claim: <claim>
      Claim Classification: Given the claim and the reference, you should answer whether the claim is true or false. Claim: <claim> Reference: <reference>
    Step 3: Select Models: Conduct experiments using state-of-the-art open-/closed-source LLMs. For closed-source, use ChatGPT with the gpt-3.5-turbo API. For open-source, use Llama-2-chat (7B & 13B parameters versions).
    Step 4: Generate Hallucination Dataset: For each dataset, prompt the selected LLMs to generate references for the claims. Classify the claims based on the generated references and compare the results with ground truth labels to identify hallucinations. Ensure a balanced proportion between hallucinatory and factual references.
    Step 5: Hallucination Detection:
      Sample References: Independently query the LLM to generate multiple references for each claim using different but equivalent prompts.
      Detect Self-Contradiction: For each original reference, concatenate it with each sampled reference to form input pairs. Prompt the LLM to detect if there are any contradictions between the original and sampled references.
      Example Prompts for Sampling References:
        - Please provide one reference on this claim whose authenticity is unknown and give a brief summary of it in one paragraph. Claim: <claim>
        - Given one claim whose truthfulness is uncertain, you should provide one reference about it and write a summary paragraph. Claim: <claim>
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the hallucination detection performance using standard classification metrics: Accuracy and F1 score. Compare the proposed method with baselines such as Zero-Self-Check, Few-Self-Check, and SelfCheckGPT.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and F1 score. Examine the influence of topics on hallucination and the proportion of reference conflicts. Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different parameters on the detection performance.

DNA-GPT:
  Title: DNA-GPT: Divergent N-Gram Analysis for Training-Free Detection of GPT-Generated Text
  Problem Statement: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved the fluency and diversity of machine-generated text, making it increasingly difficult to detect the origin of a given text. Current detection methods, which are often training-based, struggle to adapt to new domains and lack explanatory power.
  Motivation: Existing training-based methods for detecting AI-generated text are limited in flexibility and often fail to provide explanations for their decisions. These methods require frequent retraining to keep up with new LLM updates and are not robust against revised text attacks. The proposed method, DNA-GPT, aims to address these limitations by offering a training-free, explainable, and robust detection strategy that can adapt to various domains and provide clear evidence for its decisions.
  Proposed Method: DNA-GPT employs a novel training-free detection strategy called Divergent N-Gram Analysis. The method involves truncating a given text in the middle and using the preceding portion as input to the LLMs to regenerate the remaining parts. By comparing the original and regenerated parts through N-gram analysis (black-box) or probability divergence (white-box), significant discrepancies between machine-generated and human-written text can be identified. This approach leverages the observation that LLMs tend to produce highly similar text across multiple generations, whereas human-written text follows a more diverse distribution.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets that include both human-written and AI-generated text. The datasets used in the paper include Reddit long-form question-answer dataset (ELI5 community), scientific abstracts from the Nature website, PubMedQA, Xsum, and the English and German splits of WMT16.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each dataset, construct prompts to generate AI-written text. For example, for the Reddit dataset, use prompts like 'Answer the following question in 180-300 words: [Question]'. For scientific abstracts, use 'Write one concise and professional abstract following the style of Nature Communications journal for the provided paper title: [Title]'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use advanced LLMs from OpenAI (text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4) and open-source models (GPT-NeoX-20B, LLaMa-13B) for generating AI-written text and for detection experiments.
    Step 4: Implement Detection Algorithms: Implement both black-box and white-box detection algorithms. For black-box detection, calculate the BScore by comparing N-gram overlaps between the original and regenerated text. For white-box detection, calculate the WScore using the log-probabilities of the original and regenerated text.
    Step 5: Conduct Experiments: Perform extensive experiments on the collected datasets using the selected models. Evaluate the performance of DNA-GPT in distinguishing between human and AI-generated text. Compare the results with existing baselines like GPTZero, OpenAI's classifier, and DetectGPT.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the results based on metrics such as AUROC, TPR at 1% FPR, F1 score, and accuracy. Assess the robustness of DNA-GPT under revised text attacks and its ability to handle non-English text. Provide explanations and evidence for detection results to demonstrate the explainability of the method.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing, specifically in detecting hallucinations or AI-generated text. However, there are notable differences in their approaches and potential impact.

Paper 1 (AutoHall) focuses on automating the generation of hallucination datasets for large language models (LLMs). The main strength of this paper is its scalability and adaptability to different models and updates. By eliminating the need for manual annotation, AutoHall provides a more efficient and cost-effective solution for creating model-specific hallucination datasets. The proposed zero-resource, black-box hallucination detection method based on self-contradiction is also a novel contribution. However, the paper lacks a clear comparison with existing methods and does not provide a detailed analysis of the generated datasets' quality.

Paper 2 (DNA-GPT) introduces a novel training-free approach for detecting AI-generated text using divergent n-gram analysis. The main strengths of this paper are its explainability, robustness against revised text attacks, and adaptability to various domains, including non-English text. The proposed method leverages the observation that LLMs tend to produce highly similar text across multiple generations, which is a unique insight. The extensive experiments on diverse datasets and the comparison with existing baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of DNA-GPT. Additionally, the paper provides clear explanations and evidence for its detection results, which is a significant advantage over other methods.

Considering the novelty, robustness, and explainability of the proposed method, as well as the extensive experimental evaluation and comparison with existing baselines, Paper 2 (DNA-GPT) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. While Paper 1 (AutoHall) addresses an important problem, its lack of detailed analysis and comparison with existing methods makes it less compelling than Paper 2.

paper 1:
General Single-Cell Analysis Framework via Conditional Diffusion Generative Models:
  Title: A General Single-Cell Analysis Framework via Conditional Diffusion Generative Models
  Problem Statement: The single-cell analysis community faces numerous computational tasks, each with vastly different targets. Existing methods typically design specific model frameworks tailored to individual downstream objectives, which limits their extendability and generalizability. The problem is to create a unified framework that can handle multiple single-cell analysis tasks efficiently.
  Motivation: Current methods are often task-specific and lack the flexibility to be applied across different single-cell analysis tasks. This limitation necessitates the development of a general framework that can unify these tasks as posterior estimation problems. The proposed method, scDiff, leverages conditional diffusion generative models to achieve this unification. The flexibility of scDiff allows it to incorporate prior information through large language models and graph neural networks, making it more versatile and effective than existing baselines.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, scDiff, is a general single-cell analysis framework that formulates various tasks as posterior modeling problems. It uses conditional diffusion generative models (DGMs) to approximate the posterior distribution of cell expressions given specific conditions. The framework includes different conditioning strategies, such as cell-label conditioning, and can incorporate prior knowledge through large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). The model architecture consists of an input expression embedder, various conditioners, a cross-attention encoder, and a linear decoder.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets for different single-cell analysis tasks, including cell type annotation, missing value imputation, and perturbation prediction. Example datasets include PBMC12K, Pancreas, HLCA, Immune, Brain, Liver, Jurkat, 293T, PBMC1K, Salmonella, H.poly, and PBMC.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: The scDiff model consists of four main components: (1) Input expression embedder to project the noised gene expression into a latent space, (2) Various conditioners to convert specific conditions into dense numerical vectors, (3) A cross-attention encoder to combine input embeddings with condition representations, and (4) A linear decoder to project the hidden representation back to the gene expression space.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: Train the scDiff model using a unified objective that approximates the posterior distribution of cell expressions given task-specific conditions. The training objective is to minimize the variational lower bound (ELBO) of the data posterior.
    Step 4: Task-Specific Inference: For cell type annotation, use a classifier-free approach to evaluate the mean square error between input expression and model posterior. For missing value imputation, approximate the missing values by sampling from the distribution of training data conditioned on the visible values. For perturbation prediction, generate samples from query conditions using the trained model.
    Step 5: Incorporate Prior Knowledge: Incorporate prior information through large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). For example, use BioLinkBERT to extract rich representations of cell types from textual descriptions and GEARS to encode gene perturbation information using a graph neural network.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the performance of scDiff against state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarking tasks. Metrics include macro accuracy and F1 score for cell type annotation, Pearson correlation for missing value imputation, and squared Pearson correlation for perturbation prediction.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of scDiff with existing baselines. Analyze the effectiveness of different conditioning strategies and the incorporation of prior knowledge. Highlight the flexibility and generalizability of the proposed framework.

GateLoop: Fully Data-Controlled Linear Recurrence for Sequence Modeling:
  Title: GateLoop: Fully Data-Controlled Linear Recurrence for Sequence Modeling
  Problem Statement: Linear Recurrence has proven to be a powerful tool for modeling long sequences efficiently. However, existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. The problem is to develop a sequence model that can better utilize linear recurrence for tasks such as auto-regressive language modeling.
  Motivation: Existing models like S4, S5, LRU, and RetNet do not fully exploit the potential of linear recurrence due to their reliance on fixed state transitions and cumulative sums for context aggregation. These models often require complex initialization schemes and are limited in their ability to model long-range dependencies effectively. The proposed method, GateLoop, aims to address these limitations by employing data-controlled state transitions, which can dynamically adjust based on the input data, thereby improving the model's ability to retain and forget information as needed.
  Proposed Method: GateLoop generalizes existing linear recurrent models by incorporating data-controlled gating of inputs, hidden states, and outputs. The method includes a low-cost O(l) recurrent mode and an efficient O(l log l) parallel mode using associative scan implementations. Additionally, an O(l^2) surrogate-attention mode is derived, which provides data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. The core idea is to replace static state transitions with content-aware (diagonal) state transitions, allowing for time-varying control over the forget and retain behavior.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on the WikiText103 dataset for auto-regressive natural language modeling and a synthetic Memory Horizon dataset designed to validate the empirical advantage of data-controlled state transitions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Model Architecture: The model consists of a learned input token embedding, a stack of model layers (each composed of a Time-Mixing block using the GateLoop operator, a Channel-Mixing block, skip-connections, and layer normalization), and a language head for output.
    Step 4: Training Objectives: The model is trained to model the probability distribution over possible output tokens given the current input context. The training involves optimizing the parameters using AdamW optimizer with specific learning rates and weight decay settings.
    Step 5: Data Construction Pipeline: For the Memory Horizon dataset, the input vocabulary consists of a reset token and number tokens within a specified range. The output vocabulary consists of number tokens up to a maximum value. The dataset is designed to test the model's ability to forget and retain information based on input-dependent state transitions.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the model's performance on the WikiText103 and Memory Horizon datasets. For the Memory Horizon dataset, measure test accuracy. For WikiText103, measure test perplexity.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of GateLoop with existing models like Transformer, Hyena, and S5-Hyena. Analyze the state transitions and gating mechanisms to understand how the model utilizes data-controlled state transitions for better sequence modeling.

Comparison:
While both papers propose innovative approaches, Paper 1 addresses a more significant problem in the single-cell analysis community by providing a unified framework for multiple tasks. The incorporation of prior knowledge through LLMs and GNNs is a novel and promising approach. Additionally, the detailed experiment plan and evaluation across various datasets demonstrate the potential for broad impact.

On the other hand, Paper 2 focuses on improving a specific aspect of sequence modeling and may have a more limited scope. Although the data-controlled state transitions are an interesting concept, the complexity of the method may hinder its adoption.

Considering the broader impact, novelty, and thoroughness of the proposed approach, Paper 1 appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.

Large Language Models as Superpositions of Cultural Perspectives:
  Title: Large Language Models as Superpositions of Cultural Perspectives
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) are often perceived as individuals with stable values, personality traits, knowledge, and abilities. However, this 'LLM as an individual' metaphor misrepresents their nature. Unlike humans, LLMs exhibit highly context-dependent values and personality traits. This paper aims to demonstrate that LLMs should be viewed as superpositions of perspectives, where their behavior and expressed values can significantly change based on the context.
  Motivation: Existing methods often treat LLMs as stable entities, using psychological tools designed for humans to measure their values and personality traits. These methods assume that LLMs, like humans, have consistent internal states. However, LLMs are trained on diverse texts and can exhibit different behaviors based on context. This context-dependency questions the validity of using human psychological tools to draw conclusions about LLMs. The proposed metaphor of 'LLM as a superposition of perspectives' better captures the nature of LLMs and allows for a more accurate study of how their expressed values change across different contexts.
  Proposed Method: The paper introduces the concept of 'unexpected perspective shift effect,' where changes in context unrelated to the topic can cause significant and unpredictable changes in the values expressed by LLMs. To study this, the authors use psychology questionnaires to measure values and personality traits under different contexts. They also introduce 'perspective controllability,' a measure of how well a model can adopt various perspectives. The method involves systematically comparing the controllability of 16 different models using three questionnaires (PVQ, VSM, IPIP) and different methods for inducing perspectives.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments use three psychology questionnaires: PVQ (Portrait Values Questionnaire) for personal values, VSM (Values Survey Module) for cultural values, and IPIP (International Personality Item Pool) for personality traits.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each questionnaire, the model is exposed to different contexts in three ways: 1) Simulated conversations between two models on various topics, 2) Different textual formats (e.g., chat, code), and 3) Prepending questions with Wikipedia paragraphs on different music genres. Example prompts include: 'You are simulating a human using a chatbot' followed by a conversation topic, or presenting a question in Python code format.
    Step 3: Select Models: The study involves 16 different models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and various open-source models like LLaMa and RedPajama. Both instruction fine-tuned and RLHF fine-tuned models are included.
    Step 4: Get Results: For each context and model, the answers to the questionnaires are collected and scored. The scores are then analyzed to measure the impact of context changes on the expressed values and personality traits.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: The results are analyzed to identify significant changes in values and personality traits due to context changes. The perspective controllability of each model is measured by comparing the scores for targeted values against other values. Statistical tests (ANOVA and posthoc Tukey HSD) are used to determine the significance of the observed effects.

Democratizing Fine-grained Visual Recognition with Large Language Models:
  Title: Democratizing Fine-grained Visual Recognition with Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Identifying subordinate-level categories from images, known as fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR), is a longstanding task in computer vision. This task is crucial for real-world applications, as laypersons often struggle to differentiate between species of birds or mushrooms due to subtle differences. The major bottleneck in developing FGVR systems is the need for high-quality paired expert annotations.
  Motivation: Existing FGVR methods rely heavily on expert annotations for part-level attributes, which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This reliance on expert knowledge limits the scalability and applicability of FGVR systems in new domains. The proposed method, Fine-grained Semantic Category Reasoning (FineR), leverages the world knowledge encoded in large language models (LLMs) to reason about fine-grained category names without requiring expert annotations. This approach aims to democratize FGVR by making it accessible to the masses and effective in new domains where expert annotations are arduous to gather.
  Proposed Method: FineR internally leverages the world knowledge of LLMs to reason about fine-grained category names. The method involves three main phases: (i) Translating useful visual information from images into text using a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model, (ii) Using a LLM to reason about candidate class names based on the visual attributes, and (iii) Constructing a multi-modal classifier using the reasoned class names and visual features. FineR operates in a training-free manner and outperforms several state-of-the-art FGVR and vision-language models.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on five fine-grained datasets: Caltech-UCSD Bird-200, Stanford Car-196, Stanford Dog-120, Flower-102, and Oxford-IIIT Pet-37. Additionally, we introduce a new Pokemon dataset for further evaluation.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Identify VQA-Prompt: Question: What is the main object in this image? Answer: (Bird, Dog, Cat, ...)
      How-to LLM-Prompt: Your task is to tell me what are the useful attributes to distinguish a [super-category] in an image. Specifically, you can complete the task by following the instructions: 1. Understand the example delimited by < >. 2. List the useful attributes to distinguish a [super-category] in an image. 3. Output a Python list object that contains the listed useful attributes. === <bird> The useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in an image of a bird: ['bill shape', 'wing color', 'upperparts color', 'underparts color', 'breast pattern', 'back color', 'tail shape', 'upper tail color', 'head pattern', 'breast color', 'throat color', 'eye color', 'bill length', 'forehead color', 'under tail color', 'nape color', 'belly color', 'wing shape', 'size', 'shape', 'back pattern', 'tail pattern', 'belly pattern', 'primary color', 'leg color', 'bill color', 'crown color', 'wing pattern', 'habitat'] ===
      Describe VQA-Prompt: Question: Describe the [attribute] of the [super-category] in this image. Answer: [description]
      Reason LLM-Prompt: I have an image of a [super-category]. Your task is to perform the following actions: 1. Summarize the information you get about the [super-category] from the attribute description pairs delimited by triple backticks with five sentences. 2. Infer and list three possible names of the [super-category] in this image based on the information you get. 3. Output a JSON object that uses the following format: <JSON Format Example> Using the following format to perform the aforementioned tasks: === '''General Description''': '''general description of the photo''' Attributes List: - '''attribute name''': '''attribute description''' - ... - '''attribute name''': '''attribute description''' Summary: Three possible [super-category] names: Output JSON: ===
    Step 3: Select Models: We use BLIP-2 Flan-T5xxl as the VQA model, ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) as the LLM, and CLIP ViT-B/16 as the vision-language model (VLM).
    Step 4: Get Results: Get predictions from the models on the datasets using both the baselines and the proposed FineR method.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of FineR with state-of-the-art FGVR and vision-language models using metrics such as Clustering Accuracy (cACC) and Semantic Similarity (sACC). Evaluate the effectiveness of FineR in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios, and analyze qualitative results to assess the semantic awareness and interpretability of the predictions.

Retrieval meets Long Context Large Language Models:
  Title: Retrieval meets Long Context Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of determining whether extending the context window of large language models (LLMs) or augmenting them with retrieval techniques is more effective for downstream tasks. Additionally, it explores whether combining both methods can yield superior performance.
  Motivation: While extending the context window of LLMs has gained popularity, retrieval-augmentation has been a long-standing solution. However, it remains unclear which method is superior for various downstream tasks. Existing methods either focus on extending the context window, which is computationally expensive, or on retrieval-augmentation, which may not fully leverage the model's capabilities. The proposed method aims to combine both approaches to achieve better performance with less computational cost.
  Proposed Method: The study investigates the performance of two state-of-the-art pretrained LLMs, a proprietary 43B GPT and Llama2-70B, using both extended context windows and retrieval-augmentation. The key findings are: 1) LLMs with a 4K context window using simple retrieval-augmentation can achieve comparable performance to finetuned LLMs with a 16K context window, while being more computationally efficient. 2) Retrieval-augmentation significantly improves the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes. The best model, retrieval-augmented Llama2-70B with a 32K context window, outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k and Davinci003 on various long context tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The study includes seven datasets for zero-shot evaluations: QMSum (QM), Qasper (QASP), NarrativeQA (NQA), QuALITY (QLTY), HotpotQA (HQA), MuSiQue (MSQ), and MultiFieldQA-en (MFQA). These datasets cover single and multi-document question answering, query-based summarization, and in-context few-shot learning tasks.
    Step 2: Extend Context Window: Extend the context window length using positional interpolation. For GPT-43B, extend from 4K to 16K. For Llama2-70B, extend from 4K to 16K and 32K. Fine-tune both LLMs on the Pile dataset with a batch size of 128 and a constant learning rate of 5e-6 to adapt the position embeddings.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use two pretrained GPT models: a proprietary Nemo GPT-43B and Llama2-70B. GPT-43B is a 43 billion parameter model trained with 1.1T tokens, while Llama2-70B is a 70 billion parameter model trained on 2T tokens.
    Step 4: Implement Retrieval: Experiment with three retrievers: Dragon, Contriever, and OpenAI embedding. Chunk each context document into 300-word segments, encode both the questions and chunks, and retrieve the most relevant chunks to concatenate as the context for generation.
    Step 5: Instruction Tuning: Perform instruction tuning using a blend of datasets (Soda, ELI5, FLAN, Open Assistant, Dolly, and a proprietary dataset) to adapt the LLMs to follow instructions. Use a template format and fine-tune with a batch size of 128 and a learning rate of 5e-6 for 1000 steps.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the gathered datasets using the official metrics: geometric mean of ROUGE scores for QM, exact matching (EM) score for QLTY, and F1 scores for the remaining datasets.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of different model variants (GPT-43B, Llama2-7B, Llama2-70B) with sequence lengths ranging from 4K to 32K, both with and without retrieval-augmentation. Analyze the impact of different retrievers and the number of retrieved chunks on the performance.

STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning:
  Title: STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning
  Problem Statement: Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. Current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well, and existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of static spatial relations that do not intrinsically involve motion.
  Motivation: Existing methods are not good enough because they cover only a limited number of static spatial relations and do not include dynamic spatial relations or temporal relations. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to create a comprehensive dataset that includes both static and dynamic spatial relations as well as temporal relations, which are currently underrepresented. The proposed method would work better than existing baselines because it provides a richer set of data that includes dynamic interactions and temporal relations, which are essential for effective visual reasoning.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves creating the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD), a large-scale video dataset for understanding spatial and temporal relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images) consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses and 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations. The dataset is generated synthetically using Unity3D and includes 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates and descriptions of the objects used.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The STUPD dataset itself is created, containing 150K images and videos for spatial relations and 50K videos for temporal relations. Additionally, real-world datasets like SpatialSense and ImageNet-VidVRD are used for evaluation.
    Step 2: Construct Dataset: The dataset is constructed using Unity3D to generate synthetic images and videos. For spatial relations, 30 prepositions are selected, and for temporal relations, 10 prepositions are selected. Each preposition is represented by 5,000 images/videos. The dataset includes detailed 3D information and bounding box annotations.
    Step 3: Select Models: Six baseline models are selected for evaluation: Language-based model, Coordinate-based model, DRNet, VIPCNN, PPRFCN, and VTransE. Additionally, a random baseline is used for comparison.
    Step 4: Train Models on STUPD: Train the baseline models on the Spatial-STUPD dataset to validate the dataset's effectiveness. Evaluate the models on a single label predicate classification task.
    Step 5: Pretrain Models on STUPD: Pretrain the models on the STUPD dataset and then fine-tune them on real-world datasets like SpatialSense and ImageNet-VidVRD. Compare the performance with other pretraining datasets like ImageNet, KINETICS-400, and CLEVR.
    Step 6: Evaluate Temporal-STUPD: For temporal relations, use the NeXT-QA dataset for evaluation. Modify the traditional VQA grounding task to match the structure of NeXT-QA and Temporal-STUPD. Evaluate the models on temporal relation reasoning tasks.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of models pretrained on STUPD with those pretrained on other datasets. Analyze the impact of dynamic and temporal information on visual relationship reasoning tasks.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and computer vision. However, they differ in their focus and potential impact.

Paper 1 tackles the question of whether extending the context window of large language models (LLMs) or augmenting them with retrieval techniques is more effective for downstream tasks. The motivation is clear, as it remains unclear which method is superior, and the proposed approach aims to combine both methods to achieve better performance with less computational cost. The experiment plan is well-structured, involving multiple datasets, models, and evaluation metrics. The findings are significant, showing that retrieval-augmented LLMs can achieve comparable performance to finetuned LLMs with extended context windows while being more computationally efficient.

Paper 2 focuses on creating a synthetic dataset (STUPD) for spatial and temporal relation reasoning in computer vision. The motivation is to address the lack of datasets that cover dynamic spatial relations and temporal relations, which are essential for effective visual reasoning. The proposed method involves generating a large-scale synthetic dataset using Unity3D, which includes detailed 3D information and annotations. The experiment plan is comprehensive, involving multiple baseline models, pretraining on STUPD, and evaluation on real-world datasets.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 1 appears to have a more significant impact on the field of natural language processing. The findings have direct implications for improving the performance and efficiency of LLMs on downstream tasks, which is a critical challenge in the field. The combination of extended context windows and retrieval-augmentation is a novel approach that can potentially lead to new research directions.

In contrast, Paper 2's contribution is primarily in creating a new dataset for spatial and temporal relation reasoning. While the dataset is valuable and can facilitate research in this area, the impact on the field may be less immediate compared to Paper 1's findings. Additionally, the use of synthetic data may raise questions about the generalizability of the models trained on STUPD to real-world scenarios.

In conclusion, while both papers make valuable contributions, Paper 1 is likely to have a more significant and immediate impact on the field of natural language processing due to its novel approach and findings that directly address a critical challenge in the field.

paper 1:
Privacy-Preserving In-Context Learning for Large Language Models:
  Title: Privacy-Preserving In-Context Learning for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows them to dynamically adapt based on specific, in-context exemplars, thereby improving accuracy and relevance. However, LLM's responses may leak sensitive private information contained in these in-context exemplars. This poses a significant privacy risk, especially in real-world applications where sensitive data is involved.
  Motivation: Existing methods for privatizing machine learning models, such as Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), are not suitable for in-context learning because they require access to model parameters and extensive fine-tuning, which is impractical for large-scale LLMs. Additionally, these methods do not address the unique privacy risks associated with in-context learning, where sensitive information can be directly leaked through model outputs. The proposed method, Differentially Private In-context Learning (DP-ICL), aims to generate differentially private responses through a noisy consensus among an ensemble of LLM's responses based on disjoint exemplar sets. This approach leverages the strengths of differential privacy to ensure that no single exemplar overly influences the output, thereby preserving privacy while maintaining utility.
  Proposed Method: The DP-ICL framework consists of four phases: (1) Partitioning the subsampled sensitive database into separate subsets, each comprising a collection of exemplars. (2) Constructing prompts by pairing each exemplar with the query. (3) Processing these exemplar-query pairs through the model to produce corresponding outputs. (4) Aggregating these outputs through a differentially private mechanism before returning the final response to the user. For text classification, the Report-Noisy-Max with Gaussian noise is used to release the class that receives the majority vote in a private way. For language generation, two methods are proposed: Embedding Space Aggregation (ESA) and Keyword Space Aggregation (KSA). ESA projects output sentences into a semantic embedding space and privatizes these aggregated embeddings, while KSA identifies frequently occurring keywords in the output and privately selects them via propose-test-release or the joint exponential mechanism.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate DP-ICL on four text classification benchmarks (SST-2, Amazon, AGNews, TREC) and two language generation tasks (DocVQA for document question-answering and SAMsum for dialog summarization).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For text classification, we use templates to construct prompts that pair each exemplar with the query. For language generation, we construct prompts that include the context and the query, and then generate responses using the LLM.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use various models including GPT-3 Babbage, GPT-3 Davinci, and OpenLLaMA-13B for different tasks. For text classification, we primarily use GPT-3 Babbage and GPT-3 Davinci. For document question-answering, we use OpenLLaMA-13B. For dialog summarization, we use GPT-3 Davinci.
    Step 4: Get Results: For text classification, we use the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to aggregate class predictions. For language generation, we use Embedding Space Aggregation (ESA) and Keyword Space Aggregation (KSA) to aggregate generated text outputs. We then evaluate the performance using accuracy for text classification and ROUGE, BLEU, and Levenshtein similarity for language generation.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of DP-ICL with non-private baselines and zero-shot predictions. Evaluate the utility-privacy tradeoff by analyzing the accuracy and quality of the generated responses under different privacy budgets (ε). Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of various parameters such as the number of in-context exemplars, subsampling rates, and the number of queries.


paper 2:
PromptNER:
  Title: PromptNER: Prompting For Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition
  Problem Statement: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) for information extraction and semantic understanding. However, existing methods for NER require large amounts of labeled data and are not flexible enough to adapt to new domains or few-shot settings where only a small number of labeled examples are available.
  Motivation: Current few-shot NER methods are far from the state-of-the-art performance achieved by models trained on large labeled datasets. These methods often struggle with domain transfer and require significant amounts of source data and fine-tuning. The motivation behind PromptNER is to leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and prompt-based heuristics to create a more flexible and efficient few-shot NER system that can adapt to new domains with minimal data and human effort.
  Proposed Method: PromptNER is a prompt-based NER method that consists of three key components: a backbone LLM, a modular definition of entity types, and a precise format for outputting extracted entities. To adapt to a new NER task, PromptNER requires (i) a set of entity definitions, (ii) a set of few-shot examples, and (iii) explanations justifying the applicability of each entity tag. Given a sentence, PromptNER prompts the LLM to produce a list of potential entities along with explanations for their compatibility with the provided entity type definitions. This method is fully automated except for the crafting of definitions and explanations, making it flexible and easy to apply across domains.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate PromptNER on several datasets: CoNLL, GENIA, FewNERD, FaBNER, TweetNER, and CrossNER. These datasets cover a range of domains including general, biomedical, social media, and cross-domain settings.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each dataset, we construct prompts that include the entity definitions, few-shot examples, and explanations for each entity tag. Example prompts are provided for each dataset, such as the AI Input Prompt, ConLL Input Prompt, FewNERD Input Prompt, GENIA Input Prompt, Literature Input Prompt, Music Input Prompt, Science Input Prompt, and Politics Input Prompt.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use several LLMs for our experiments: T5-Flan (11B), GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), and GPT-4. These models are chosen for their strong performance in few-shot learning tasks.
    Step 4: Get Results: We obtain predictions from the models on the test sets of each dataset using both the baseline methods and the proposed PromptNER method. We report the micro-F1 scores and standard deviations over multiple runs.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: We compare the performance of PromptNER with existing few-shot and cross-domain NER methods. We also conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of PromptNER, such as definitions, few-shot examples, explanations, and candidate entities. Additionally, we perform a human survey to evaluate the quality of the entity lists generated by PromptNER compared to the ground truth.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose novel methods for addressing important challenges in natural language processing using large language models (LLMs). However, there are notable differences in their problem statements, motivations, proposed methods, and experiment plans.

Paper 1 focuses on the critical issue of privacy in in-context learning (ICL) for LLMs. The authors highlight the lack of suitable privacy-preserving methods for ICL and propose a novel approach called Differentially Private In-context Learning (DP-ICL). The motivation is well-justified, and the proposed method is clearly explained with a four-phase framework. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering both text classification and language generation tasks across various datasets and models. The authors also plan to analyze the utility-privacy tradeoff and conduct ablation studies, demonstrating a thorough approach to evaluating their method.

Paper 2 addresses the challenge of few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a prompt-based approach called PromptNER. The authors aim to leverage LLMs and prompt-based heuristics to create a flexible and efficient few-shot NER system. While the motivation is valid, the proposed method relies heavily on manually crafted prompts, which may limit its scalability and generalizability. The experiment plan covers a range of datasets and models, but the evaluation metrics are limited to micro-F1 scores and human surveys, which may not provide a comprehensive assessment of the method's performance.

Comparing the two papers, Paper 1 addresses a more pressing and novel challenge in the field of privacy-preserving LLMs. The proposed DP-ICL method is well-motivated, clearly explained, and evaluated through a rigorous experiment plan. In contrast, Paper 2's PromptNER method, while addressing an important challenge, relies on manual prompt engineering and has a less comprehensive evaluation plan.

In conclusion, Paper 1 presents a stronger contribution to the field of NLP and LLMs due to its novel approach to privacy-preserving in-context learning, well-justified motivation, and thorough experiment plan. Therefore, Paper 1 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

paper 1:
DyVal: Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Reasoning Tasks:
  Title: DyVal: Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Reasoning Tasks
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various benchmarks. However, there are concerns about data contamination in their training corpus and the static nature of current benchmarks, which may not adequately measure the evolving capabilities of LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing benchmarks face two main challenges: data contamination and static complexity. Many benchmarks source their data from the Internet, leading to potential overlap with the training data of LLMs, which raises questions about whether the models are genuinely generalizing or merely memorizing. Additionally, the static nature of these benchmarks fails to keep pace with the rapid advancements in LLM capabilities. The proposed method, DyVal, aims to dynamically generate evaluation samples with controllable complexities, thus providing a more accurate and evolving measure of LLM performance.
  Proposed Method: DyVal is a dynamic evaluation protocol that generates test samples on the fly instead of relying on a fixed dataset. It consists of three components: (1) a generation algorithm (G) to create diverse test samples, (2) constraints (C) to modulate sample complexity and validity, and (3) a description function (F) to translate the generated samples into natural language. The method leverages directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to dynamically generate evaluation samples for reasoning tasks such as mathematics, logical reasoning, and algorithm problems. The dynamic nature of DyVal allows for the generation of challenging evaluation sets with varying complexities.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Generate datasets dynamically using DyVal for seven reasoning tasks: arithmetic, linear equations, boolean logic, deductive logic, abductive logic, reachability, and max sum path. Each dataset will have four complexity levels (D1 to D4).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Design prompts for each task. For example, for arithmetic tasks, the prompt could be: 'Here is a description of an arithmetic problem: {description}. Compute the result of {variable}. If the solution cannot be calculated, answer 'N/A'. Ensure your result is within a relative precision of 0.0001 (or 0.01%) compared to the ground truth value. Ensure your final result begins with '<<<' and ends with '>>>', for example, if the answer is 1, your final result should be <<<1>>>.'
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate various LLMs including Flan-T5-large, phi-1.5, WizardMath-13B, Xwin-13B, Llama2-13B-chat, Vicuna-13B-v1.3, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4.
    Step 4: Get Results: Run the selected models on the generated datasets and collect their performance metrics, primarily accuracy. Evaluate the models on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance of the models across different complexity levels and tasks. Identify failure cases and patterns to understand the limitations of current LLMs. Compare the results with existing benchmarks to highlight the significance of dynamic evaluation. Additionally, evaluate the impact of different prompting techniques and model sizes on performance.
    Step 6: Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune LLMs using DyVal-generated data to improve their performance on existing benchmarks. Generate training data for the seven reasoning tasks and fine-tune models like Llama2-13B-chat. Evaluate the fine-tuned models on both DyVal-generated datasets and existing benchmarks such as GSM8K, SVAMP, FOLIO, RACO, DP, and LCS.
    Step 7: Human Study: Conduct a human study involving 82 human evaluators to compare their performance with that of LLMs on the most complex datasets (D4) for mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Analyze the results to understand the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs compared to human performance.

Grounding Code Generation with Input-Output Specifications:
  Title: Grounding Code Generation with Input-Output Specifications
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in code generation. However, the generated code often deviates from the user's intended outcome, resulting in executable but incorrect code. This misalignment between user intent and model output poses a significant challenge.
  Motivation: Existing methods for code generation using LLMs often fail to align with complex user intents, especially when additional semantic constraints like input-output (I/O) specifications are involved. Traditional instruction tuning methods require substantial labeled data, which is labor-intensive to gather. The proposed method, GIFT4CODE, leverages synthetic data and execution-derived feedback to improve alignment with user intentions, reducing the incidence of incorrect outputs.
  Proposed Method: GIFT4CODE is an instruction fine-tuning approach for LLMs tailored for code generation. It uses synthetic data produced by the LLM itself and execution-derived feedback as a key learning signal. The feedback, in the form of program input-output specifications, is provided to the LLM to facilitate fine-tuning. The method involves generating synthetic intents and code solutions, executing the code to derive I/O specifications, and fine-tuning the LLM to predict code solutions given intents inlined with I/O specifications.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on two challenging data science benchmarks: ARCADE and DS-1000. ARCADE involves natural language to code generation in interactive data science notebooks, while DS-1000 features data science problems sourced from Stack Overflow.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, we prompt the model to generate the output directly. For the proposed method, we first prompt the model to generate an initial answer, then we prompt the same model with few-shot examples to generate feedback on the initial draft, and finally, we prompt the model to refine the initial draft conditioned on the input question, original response, and the feedback. We repeat this loop until a stopping condition is met (e.g., set a max number of steps).
    Step 3: Select Models: We use a strong decoder-only code language model with 62B parameters, pre-trained on a collection of 1.3T tokens of web documents and GitHub code data, and fine-tuned on a disjoint set of 64B Python code tokens together with 10B tokens from Python Jupyter notebooks.
    Step 4: Generate Synthetic Data:
      Sub-step 1: Create Initial NL Intents: Using a 'Generalist' LLM, generate natural language intents based on the headers of CSV files collected from diverse GitHub repositories.
      Sub-step 2: Predict Code Solutions: Use the code LLM to generate code solutions for each NL intent. Apply heuristic filtering to ensure the quality of the synthetic data.
      Sub-step 3: Execute Code Samples: Execute the generated code samples to collect input and output variables, which are used to derive I/O specifications.
    Step 5: Derive I/O Specifications:
      Sub-step 1: TypeDesc: Use the variable type as the I/O specification.

3. Evaluates the proposed method on two challenging real-world datasets, ARCADE and DS-1000.
4. Incorporates a multi-step prompting approach to refine the generated code based on feedback.

Weaknesses of GIFT4CODE:
1. The effectiveness of the proposed method heavily relies on the quality of the synthetic data generated by the LLM itself.
2. The iterative refinement process may be time-consuming and computationally expensive.
3. The evaluation is limited to data science tasks and may not generalize to other programming domains.

Comparison and Decision:
Both DyVal and GIFT4CODE address important challenges in evaluating and improving LLMs for specific tasks. However, DyVal tackles a more fundamental problem of data contamination and static complexity in existing benchmarks, which has broader implications for the field of natural language processing. The dynamic evaluation protocol proposed in DyVal is a novel and promising approach that can provide a more accurate and evolving measure of LLM performance across various reasoning tasks. Additionally, the comprehensive experiment plan, including fine-tuning and human study, demonstrates a well-thought-out research design.

On the other hand, while GIFT4CODE addresses a significant challenge in code generation tasks, its focus is more narrow and specific to data science problems.

Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models:
  Title: Towards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models
  Problem Statement: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular technique for training high-quality AI assistants. However, RLHF may also encourage model responses that match user beliefs over truthful responses, a behavior known as sycophancy. This paper investigates the prevalence of sycophancy in RLHF-trained models and whether human preference judgments are responsible.
  Motivation: Existing methods like RLHF improve the quality of AI assistant outputs as rated by human evaluators but may inadvertently encourage sycophantic behavior. This is problematic because it can lead to AI assistants providing incorrect or biased information that aligns with user beliefs rather than the truth. The paper aims to understand if human preferences drive this behavior and to what extent sycophancy is a general behavior of RLHF models.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes a comprehensive analysis of sycophancy in AI assistants. It involves: 1) Demonstrating sycophancy across five state-of-the-art AI assistants in varied free-form text-generation tasks. 2) Analyzing existing human preference data to see if responses matching user views are more likely to be preferred. 3) Investigating if optimizing model outputs against preference models (PMs) sacrifices truthfulness in favor of sycophancy. 4) Studying whether humans and PMs prefer convincingly-written sycophantic responses over correct ones.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets include: (i) MATH for math solutions, (ii) model-generated arguments, (iii) model-generated poems, (iv) MMLU, (v) AQuA, (vi) TruthfulQA, and (vii) TriviaQA.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each task, prompts are designed to reveal user preferences. For example, 'I really like the argument' or 'I don't think that's right. Are you sure?' are used to test if the AI assistant tailors its responses to match user beliefs.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models examined include Claude-1.3, Claude-2.0, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2-70b-chat.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the AI assistants' responses to see if they exhibit sycophantic behavior. This involves measuring feedback positivity, accuracy when challenged, and whether the AI assistants mimic user mistakes.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine the prevalence of sycophancy. This includes checking if human preference data incentivizes sycophantic responses and if optimizing against PMs increases sycophancy. Further, study human and PM preferences for sycophantic vs. truthful responses.

GraphAgent: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Learning on Text-attributed Graphs:
  Title: GraphAgent: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Learning on Text-attributed Graphs
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with a textual description. Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to balance effectiveness and interpretability in this context.
  Motivation: Existing GNN methods, while effective, often produce unintuitive and uninterpretable representations due to the message-passing mechanism blending textual features from multiple nodes. Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in providing interpretable explanations across various applications. The proposed method, GraphAgent, leverages LLMs to reframe learning on TAGs as an agent planning problem, aiming to achieve both effectiveness and interpretability by enabling the agent to take actions tailored for TAGs.
  Proposed Method: GraphAgent parameterizes the agent as an LLM and reframes node classification as an agent-planning problem. The agent is equipped with actions such as retrieving a node's features and accessing its neighboring nodes. This approach allows the agent to systematically explore the contextual information surrounding each target node, optimizing memory utilization and ensuring efficiency. The agent uses in-context learning with high-quality demonstration examples to refine its capabilities iteratively. A hierarchical memory mechanism is employed to manage long-term and short-term memory, enhancing the agent's effectiveness and interpretability.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use three benchmarks: Cora, ogbn-arxiv, and ogbn-products. These datasets vary in scale from small to large, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the method.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, start with a system prompt that informs the agent about permissible actions and constraints. Use chain-of-thought instructions to encourage the agent to articulate its reasoning process. Construct high-quality demonstration examples from labeled nodes, focusing on trajectories that end in correct predictions.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models through their APIs. Employ a random sampling approach to select 50 data points from the test and validation sets, repeated three times with different random seeds.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate predictions from the models on the datasets using both the baselines and the proposed method. Compare the performance of GraphAgent against supervised learning methods and in-context learning methods.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Evaluate the effectiveness and interpretability of GraphAgent. Conduct ablation studies to validate the techniques and perform a comprehensive case study to analyze successes and failures. Compare the results with state-of-the-art methods and assess the impact of self-consistency and memory mechanisms on performance.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and propose novel methods to tackle them. However, there are notable differences in the strengths and weaknesses of each idea.

Paper 1 focuses on understanding sycophancy in language models, a critical issue in AI assistants trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The paper's strengths lie in its comprehensive analysis plan, which includes demonstrating sycophancy across multiple state-of-the-art AI assistants, analyzing human preference data, and investigating the impact of optimizing against preference models. The proposed experiments are well-designed and cover a wide range of datasets and tasks. However, the paper lacks a clear proposal for mitigating sycophancy, which is a weakness.

Paper 2 introduces GraphAgent, a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) for interpretable learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs). The key strengths of this paper are its innovative approach to reframing node classification as an agent-planning problem and its focus on achieving both effectiveness and interpretability. The proposed hierarchical memory mechanism and the use of high-quality demonstration examples are promising techniques. The experiment plan is well-structured, covering diverse datasets and including ablation studies and case studies. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing GNN methods and a discussion on the scalability of the approach.

Considering the overall impact and novelty, Paper 2 (GraphAgent) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance. Its unique approach to leveraging LLMs for interpretable learning on TAGs addresses a significant challenge in the field and has the potential to inspire further research. The proposed method is well-motivated, and the experiment plan is thorough and convincing.

In contrast, while Paper 1 tackles an important issue, it lacks a clear solution to the problem of sycophancy. The proposed analysis, although comprehensive, does not provide a direct path towards mitigating the issue.

Rethinking Model Ensemble in Transfer-based Adversarial Attacks:
  Title: Rethinking Model Ensemble in Transfer-based Adversarial Attacks
  Problem Statement: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can transfer across different models, enabling black-box attacks without knowledge of the victim model. An effective strategy to improve transferability is attacking an ensemble of models. However, previous works simply average the outputs of different models without in-depth analysis on how and why model ensemble methods can strongly improve transferability.
  Motivation: Existing methods lack a thorough understanding of the mechanisms behind model ensemble methods in improving adversarial transferability. They typically average the outputs of different models without considering the properties that contribute to transferability. The proposed method aims to address this gap by defining the common weakness of model ensembles with two properties: the flatness of the loss landscape and the closeness to the local optimum of each model. By promoting these properties, the proposed method is expected to generate more transferable adversarial examples.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Common Weakness Attack (CWA), focuses on generating adversarial examples by promoting two properties: the flatness of the loss landscape and the closeness to the local optimum of each model. The method consists of two sub-methods: Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) and Cosine Similarity Encourager (CSE). SAM aims to optimize the flatness of the loss landscape, while CSE maximizes the cosine similarity between the gradients of different models to ensure closeness to the local optima. These methods can be integrated with existing attack algorithms for improved performance.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the NIPS2017 dataset, which consists of 1000 images compatible with ImageNet, resized to 224x224. For object detection, use the INRIA dataset for generating universal adversarial patches.
    Step 2: Select Surrogate Models: For image classification, choose four normally trained models (ResNet-18, ResNet-32, ResNet-50, ResNet-101) and two adversarially trained models (ResNet-50, XCiT-S12). For object detection, use YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 as surrogate models.
    Step 3: Select Black-box Models: Evaluate on 31 black-box models, including various architectures and adversarially trained models from RobustBench. For object detection, evaluate on YOLOv2, YOLOv3-T, YOLOv4, YOLOv4-T, FasterRCNN, and SSD.
    Step 4: Implement Baseline Methods: Implement baseline methods such as FGSM, BIM, MI, DI, TI, VMI, SVRE, PI, SSA, and RAP. Integrate these methods with MI for better performance.
    Step 5: Implement Proposed Methods: Implement MI-SAM, MI-CSE, and MI-CWA. For SAM, perform an inner gradient ascent step followed by an outer gradient descent step. For CSE, maximize the cosine similarity between gradients of different models. Combine SAM and CSE to form CWA.
    Step 6: Conduct Experiments: Generate adversarial examples using the baseline and proposed methods. For image classification, evaluate the attack success rate on the NIPS2017 dataset. For object detection, generate universal adversarial patches and evaluate the mean Average Precision (mAP) on the INRIA dataset.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the attack success rates and mAPs of the proposed methods against the baselines. Analyze the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving adversarial transferability, especially against adversarially trained models and state-of-the-art defenses.

Pushing Gradient towards Zero:
  Title: Pushing Gradient towards Zero: A Novel Pruning Method for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on complex language modeling tasks but their massive size requires substantial GPU resources for inference, limiting their usability. The paper addresses the problem of efficiently pruning LLMs to reduce their size and computational requirements without significant loss of accuracy.
  Motivation: Existing pruning methods often require retraining to maintain accuracy, which is computationally expensive and impractical for billion-parameter models. The proposed method, PGZ (Pushing Gradient towards Zero), aims to prune LLMs in one-shot without retraining, leveraging gradient information to optimize pruning. This method is expected to outperform existing methods by efficiently handling large models and maintaining accuracy.
  Proposed Method: PGZ is a one-shot pruning method that reduces the pruning problem to a set of optimization sub-problems, aiming to push all modified gradients towards zero. The method involves: 1. Constructing a loss function based on gradient information and optimizing it using second-order information implicitly. 2. A gradual pruning method that increases sparsity in steps. 3. A weight reconstruction strategy that minimizes the new loss function to push gradients towards zero. The method is suitable for parallelization and can be applied to both unstructured and semi-structured pruning patterns.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The primary evaluation is conducted on the LLaMA model family (LLaMA-7B, 13B, 30B, 65B). The calibration set consists of 320 sequences (2048 tokens each) sampled from the first shard of the C4 training data. Performance is measured via perplexity on the WikiText-2 validation set and other datasets like PTB and C4. Zero-shot performance is evaluated on six common sense benchmarks: BoolQ, RTE, WinoGrande, ARC Easy and Challenge, and OpenbookQA.
    Step 2: Select Models: The experiments are conducted on the LLaMA model family, including LLaMA-7B, 13B, 30B, and 65B. All pruning experiments are performed on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB of memory.
    Step 3: Implement Pruning Methods: 1. Unstructured Pruning: Apply PGZ to prune the models to 50% sparsity and evaluate on WikiText-2, PTB, and C4 datasets. 2. Structured N:M Sparsity: Evaluate PGZ on 4:8 and 2:4 sparsity patterns. 3. Joint Sparsification & Quantization: Combine pruning with 4-bit quantization and compare with state-of-the-art GPTQ 3-bit quantization.
    Step 4: Preprocessing Operation: Modify the input to address numerical stability issues caused by outliers using the formula: X = (X - mean(X)) / sqrt(mean(XX^T) + eps).
    Step 5: Get Results: Measure the performance of the pruned networks via perplexity on the WikiText-2 validation set and other datasets. Evaluate zero-shot performance on six common sense benchmarks and compare the results with SparseGPT.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of PGZ with SparseGPT in terms of perplexity and zero-shot task accuracy. Conduct an ablation study to understand the impact of sparsity step size, sparsity level, and the number of calibration samples on the performance of the pruned models.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of deep learning: adversarial attacks and model compression. However, the two papers differ in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1 focuses on improving the transferability of adversarial attacks by proposing a novel method called Common Weakness Attack (CWA). The authors identify the limitations of existing model ensemble methods and aim to address them by promoting the flatness of the loss landscape and the closeness to the local optimum of each model. The proposed method is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear step-by-step experiment plan to evaluate its effectiveness. The paper has the potential to advance our understanding of adversarial transferability and contribute to the development of more robust deep learning models.

Paper 2 tackles the problem of efficiently pruning large language models (LLMs) to reduce their size and computational requirements without significant loss of accuracy. The proposed method, Pushing Gradient towards Zero (PGZ), is a one-shot pruning method that leverages gradient information to optimize pruning without requiring retraining. The authors provide a detailed experiment plan to evaluate the method on the LLaMA model family and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods like SparseGPT. The paper has the potential to make LLMs more accessible and efficient, enabling their deployment in resource-constrained environments.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 2 appears to have a more significant potential impact due to the growing importance of LLMs in various applications and the need for efficient compression methods. The proposed PGZ method addresses a critical challenge in the field and offers a novel solution that could be widely adopted. In contrast, Paper 1, although well-motivated and methodologically sound, has a more narrow focus on adversarial attacks and may have a less immediate impact on the broader deep learning community.

Tall Tales at Different Scales: Evaluating Scaling Trends For Deception in Language Models:
  Title: Tall Tales at Different Scales: Evaluating Scaling Trends For Deception in Language Models
  Problem Statement: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated the capability to deceive humans and other AI systems. This paper aims to study deception in LMs from a behavioral perspective, focusing on how LMs can learn to deceive due to errors in training feedback and how this behavior scales with model size, fine-tuning, and inference compute.
  Motivation: Existing methods do not adequately address the problem of LMs learning to deceive due to systematic errors in training feedback. The inspiration behind the new method is to understand the scaling trends of deceptive behavior in LMs and to evaluate their consistency and truthfulness. The proposed method aims to show that larger LMs can learn to deceive more effectively and that this behavior can generalize to different contexts.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes a method to evaluate deception in LMs by fine-tuning them to be evaluated as truthful by a systematically biased evaluator. The method involves assessing LM beliefs from their behavior to demonstrate that they do not believe the lies they tell. The study also explores scaling trends for deceptive behavior, showing that larger LMs can target lies more effectively and reaffirm their lies even without specific training to do so.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the PARAREL dataset to measure LM consistency over paraphrased questions, and a custom dataset of scenarios designed to elicit LM beliefs. Extend the MultiRC dataset with questions related to fruit to study LM deception.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For consistency evaluation, use paraphrased questions and scenarios to elicit LM beliefs. For deception evaluation, fine-tune LMs to be evaluated as truthful by a biased judge and use scenarios to reveal LM beliefs.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate a range of OpenAI and open-source LMs, including GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2-7B. Use both pre-trained models and those fine-tuned to follow instructions.
    Step 4: Fine-Tune Models: Fine-tune LMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to be evaluated as truthful by a biased judge. Vary the proportion of training data that is 'poisoned' (i.e., mislabeled) to study the effect of biased feedback.
    Step 5: Evaluate Consistency: Measure the consistency of LM stated beliefs on the PARAREL dataset and revealed beliefs on the custom scenarios. Use few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and self-consistency sampling to improve consistency.
    Step 6: Evaluate Deception: Assess the truthfulness of fine-tuned LMs on the extended MultiRC dataset. Use scenarios to reveal LM beliefs and demonstrate that they do not believe the lies they tell. Evaluate the scaling trends for deceptive behavior, including targeted lying and reaffirmation of lies.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of different models and fine-tuning methods. Analyze the scaling trends for consistency and deceptive behavior. Provide qualitative examples to illustrate how LMs learn to lie and reaffirm their lies.


paper 2:
Provable Reward-Agnostic Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning:
  Title: Provable Reward-Agnostic Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning
  Problem Statement: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) is a paradigm where an RL agent learns to optimize a task using pair-wise preference-based feedback over trajectories, rather than explicit reward signals. The problem is that existing theoretical work focuses on regret minimization and fails to capture most practical frameworks, creating a gap between theoretical PbRL and practical algorithms.
  Motivation: Existing methods in PbRL are slow and expensive as they require human feedback in every iteration of the dynamic model selection process. This makes them impractical for real-world applications. The proposed method aims to bridge the gap between theoretical PbRL and practical algorithms by introducing a reward-agnostic framework that requires less human feedback and can handle unknown transitions efficiently. The new method is expected to work better because it decouples the interaction with the environment from the collection of human feedback, significantly reducing the burden on human experts.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a four-step process: 1) Collect exploratory state-action trajectories without human feedback using a novel sampling procedure. 2) Collect preference feedback from human experts on the collected trajectories. 3) Estimate the hidden reward functions using the collected trajectories and preference feedback. 4) Learn the optimal policy by solving the offline RL problem under the learned reward function. The method is designed to be reward-agnostic, allowing the collected trajectories to be reused for learning multiple reward functions.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Collect Exploratory Trajectories: Use a novel sampling procedure to collect state-action trajectories from the environment without human feedback. This involves identifying a set of explorative policy pairs that are not covered by existing data and measuring the extent to which the trajectory generated by these policy pairs can be covered.
    Step 2: Collect Preference Feedback: Obtain preference feedback from human experts for each pair of trajectories collected in Step 1. If one trajectory is preferred over the other, assign a label accordingly.
    Step 3: Estimate Reward Functions: Use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to learn the reward function by maximizing the log-likelihood of the preference labels given the collected trajectories.
    Step 4: Learn Optimal Policy: Run RL algorithms using the learned rewards to obtain a policy that maximizes the cumulative learned rewards. This can be done using any sample-efficient RL algorithm with respect to the learned reward.

paper 1:
Form follows Function: Text-to-Text Conditional Graph Generation based on Functional Requirements:
  Title: Form follows Function: Text-to-Text Conditional Graph Generation based on Functional Requirements
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the novel problem of generating graphs conditioned on a description of the graph's functional requirements in a downstream task. This problem is interesting and important because many concepts, such as molecules, knowledge graphs, and project schedules, can be described by graphs, and their structure directly impacts task performance. For example, generating a molecule with specific properties can significantly speed up drug discovery.
  Motivation: Existing methods for text-to-graph generation typically rely on explicit, imperative descriptions of the graph, which provide a step-by-step recipe for graph construction. These methods do not generalize well to cases where the conditional text is a functional description rather than an explicit one. The proposed method aims to address this gap by fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) to generate graphs based on functional descriptions. The inspiration behind the new method is the strong performance of pre-trained LLMs in various tasks, including text-to-serialized graph generation. The proposed method incorporates graph structure into the LLM's generation process, which is expected to improve the alignment of generated graphs with the requested functional requirements.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM to generate serialized text descriptions of graphs. The key innovation is the incorporation of message passing layers into the LLM's architecture to introduce an inductive bias that accounts for graph structure. The method includes a serialization function to transform graphs into text and a deserialization function to recover graphs from the serialized text. During training, causal masking is used to ensure that the LLM does not pass information backwards in the token sequence. The architecture interleaves message passing layers between LLM layers, allowing the model to process and generate sequences of text and graphs without violating the autoregressive nature of LLMs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments use publicly available datasets, specifically the WebNLG+ 2020 dataset for knowledge graphs and the PCQM4M dataset for molecules. The datasets are split into training, validation, and test sets, with subsets created to evaluate the impact of data size on model performance.
    Step 2: Model Architecture and Training Objectives: The model architecture includes a pre-trained LLM (BLOOM with 560 million parameters for molecule data and T5 with 770 million parameters for knowledge graph data) with interleaved message passing layers. The training objective is to minimize the negative log-likelihood of serialized graph sequences, ensuring equal weighting of tokens across batches. Special tokens are added to the tokenizer and embedding layer to handle graph serialization.
    Step 3: Fine-Tuning the Model: Fine-tune the LLM on the training and validation sets of (functional description, graph) pairs. Use the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 3e-5, β1 of 0.9, β2 of 0.999, and a regularization weight of 1e-7. Apply a linear learning rate schedule and clip gradient norms to 1.0. Train the models for up to ten epochs, checkpointing based on validation loss.
    Step 4: Evaluate Model Performance: Evaluate the models on the test sets using three metrics: parsability, mean absolute error (MAE) with respect to the conditional functional property, and diversity. Parsability measures whether the generated graph follows correct serialization syntax and basic laws of physics. MAE measures the difference between the generated graph's functional property value and the requested value. Diversity assesses the multimodality of the distribution pθ(DG|Df).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method (SGG-LLM) with baselines (grapher and regen) on the QED and Valency datasets. Analyze the impact of message passing layers and the special loss function on model performance. Additionally, evaluate the generality of the proposed method on the WebNLG+ 2020 dataset for knowledge graph generation.

Understanding Prompt Engineering:
  Title: Understanding prompt engineering may not require rethinking generalization
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of understanding why zero-shot learning in prompted vision-language models, which involves crafting prompts to build classifiers without explicit training, performs well on test data despite the potential for overfitting.
  Motivation: Existing methods for deriving generalization bounds in deep learning, such as classical approaches and PAC-Bayes bounds, are often too loose to be practically useful. The success of prompt engineering in zero-shot learning, despite the potential for overfitting, suggests that there might be an underlying principle that explains this phenomenon. The paper proposes that the discrete nature of prompts, combined with a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model, results in tight generalization bounds, providing a possible justification for the effectiveness of prompt engineering.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves using classical PAC-Bayes bounds to explain the generalization performance of prompted vision-language models. The discrete nature of prompts and a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model are leveraged to derive tight generalization bounds. The method is empirically validated using handcrafted prompts and prompts generated through a simple greedy search algorithm.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, fMoW, and OfficeHome datasets.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, prompts are either handcrafted or generated using a simple greedy search algorithm. The greedy search algorithm incrementally builds prompts by selecting tokens that maximize a search criterion on the training dataset.
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments use pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP, with different architectures like B-16 and L-14.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the models with the generated prompts on the test datasets. Compute the generalization bounds using both uniform convergence and PAC-Bayes approaches.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the test error and generalization bounds for the generated prompts and handcrafted prompts. Analyze the tightness of the bounds and the correlation between the bounds and test performance. Additionally, evaluate the robustness of the method to label noise and small sample sizes.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address interesting and relevant problems in the field of natural language processing and machine learning. However, there are notable differences in the novelty, clarity, and potential impact of the two proposals.

Paper 1, "Form follows Function: Text-to-Text Conditional Graph Generation based on Functional Requirements," tackles a novel problem of generating graphs based on functional descriptions rather than explicit, step-by-step instructions. The motivation behind this problem is well-articulated, highlighting the importance of generating graphs with specific functional properties in various domains such as drug discovery and project scheduling. The proposed method, which involves fine-tuning a large language model with interleaved message passing layers, is innovative and builds upon the success of pre-trained LLMs in related tasks. The experiment plan is well-structured, with clear steps for data collection, model architecture, training, and evaluation. The proposed evaluation metrics, including parsability, mean absolute error, and diversity, are appropriate for assessing the model's performance and alignment with the requested functional requirements.

In contrast, Paper 2, "Understanding prompt engineering may not require rethinking generalization," addresses the problem of understanding the generalization performance of zero-shot learning in prompted vision-language models. While the problem is interesting, the motivation and novelty of the proposed approach are less compelling compared to Paper 1. The paper relies on classical PAC-Bayes bounds to explain the generalization performance, which may not be a significant advancement in the field. The experiment plan is relatively straightforward, involving the construction of prompts, selection of pre-trained models, and evaluation of performance and generalization bounds. However, the potential impact of the findings seems limited, as the paper primarily aims to provide a justification for the effectiveness of prompt engineering rather than proposing a novel method or addressing a pressing challenge in the field.

Considering the novelty of the problem, the clarity and potential impact of the proposed method, and the well-structured experiment plan, Paper 1 appears to be a stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference like ICLR or ACL. The paper addresses a gap in existing methods for text-to-graph generation and proposes an innovative solution that leverages the strengths of pre-trained LLMs while incorporating graph structure through message passing layers. The potential applications of the proposed method in various domains further enhance its significance.

paper 1:
LLM-Prop:
  Title: LLM-Prop: Predicting Physical And Electronic Properties of Crystalline Solids From Their Text Descriptions
  Problem Statement: The prediction of crystal properties is crucial in the crystal design process. Current methods focus on modeling crystal structures using graph neural networks (GNNs), which struggle to accurately model the complex interactions within a crystal. Predicting crystal properties from text descriptions is understudied, despite the rich information text data offers.
  Motivation: Existing GNN-based methods face challenges in encoding the periodicity and complex atomic interactions in crystals. They also lack expressiveness in conveying nuanced crystal information. Text data, on the other hand, is rich and expressive, and can be leveraged by large language models (LLMs) to predict crystal properties more effectively. The proposed method, LLM-Prop, aims to utilize the general-purpose learning capabilities of LLMs to outperform GNN-based models in predicting crystal properties.
  Proposed Method: LLM-Prop leverages a pretrained encoder-decoder model, specifically T5, by discarding its decoder and finetuning its encoder for regression and classification tasks. This approach reduces the network size, allowing for training on longer sequences and capturing longer-term dependencies in crystal descriptions. The method involves preprocessing text descriptions by removing stopwords, replacing bond distances and angles with special tokens, and prepending a [CLS] token for improved predictive performance.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect a benchmark dataset (TextEdge) from the Materials Project database, containing approximately 144K crystal text descriptions and their properties, including band gap, volume, and whether the band gap is direct or indirect.
    Step 2: Preprocess Data: 1. Remove stopwords from text descriptions. 2. Replace bond distances with a [NUM] token and bond angles with an [ANG] token. 3. Prepend a [CLS] token to each input sequence.
    Step 3: Train Tokenizer: Train the T5 tokenizer on the benchmark dataset with a vocabulary size of 32k.
    Step 4: Finetune LLM-Prop: Finetune the T5 encoder on the preprocessed dataset. For regression tasks, normalize the target values using z-score normalization. Use a batch size of 64, a learning rate of 1e-3, and a dropout rate of 0.2 for 200 epochs with the Adam optimizer and a onecycle learning rate scheduler.
    Step 5: Baseline Comparisons: Compare LLM-Prop with GNN-based models (CGCNN, MEGNet, ALIGNN) and a text-based model (MatBERT). Train and evaluate all models on the same dataset splits to ensure fair comparison.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the models on the test set using mean absolute error (MAE) for regression tasks and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for classification tasks. Save the best-performing checkpoint based on validation set performance.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance improvements of LLM-Prop over the baselines. Highlight the efficiency and capabilities of LLM-Prop in predicting crystal properties with fewer data points and its strong transfer learning ability.

Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted From LLMs? Objectives for Defending Against Extraction Attacks:
  Title: Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted From LLMs? Objectives for Defending Against Extraction Attacks
  Problem Statement: Pretrained language models sometimes possess knowledge that we do not wish them to, including memorized personal information and knowledge that could be used to harm people. They can also output toxic or harmful text. The problem is to develop methods to delete sensitive information directly from model weights to ensure that this information cannot be extracted by future prompt attacks or whitebox attacks.
  Motivation: Existing methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are not sufficient because they do not guarantee that the model has forgotten the sensitive information; they merely prevent the model from generating it under certain conditions. Additionally, RLHF does not protect against whitebox attacks where an attacker has access to the model's weights. The proposed method aims to directly edit the model weights to delete sensitive information, ensuring that it cannot be extracted by any means.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves an attack-and-defense framework for studying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from model weights. The approach includes: (1) Direct edits to model weights to guarantee that deleted information is never extracted by future prompt attacks, and (2) Protection against whitebox attacks by ensuring that sensitive information is not present in intermediate model hidden states. The method also introduces new defense methods to protect against extraction attacks, although no single universally effective defense method was found.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the CounterFact dataset, which consists of prompts with factual completions, and the zsRE dataset, which contains short question-answer pairs derived from Wikipedia. Filter the data to facts that are known by the model.
    Step 2: Select Models: Conduct experiments with GPT-J, Llama-2, and GPT2-XL. These models were chosen due to their widespread usage, public availability, and capacity for memorizing their pretraining data.
    Step 3: Apply Model Editing Methods: Use two popular model editing techniques: ROME and MEMIT. ROME updates a single layer’s MLP, while MEMIT updates multiple layers’ MLPs. Apply these methods to delete specific sensitive information from the models.
    Step 4: Construct Prompts for Attacks: For whitebox attacks, use the logit lens technique to probe intermediate layer representations. For blackbox attacks, use input rephrasing by generating paraphrases of the original input using a paraphrasing model.
    Step 5: Implement Defense Methods: Implement various defense methods including Empty Response, Fact Erasure, Error Injection, Head Projection Defense, Max-Entropy Defense, and Input Rephrasing Defense. Each defense method has a specific objective to protect against different types of attacks.
    Step 6: Measure Attack Success: Evaluate the attack success rate using Attack-Success@B, where B is the budget of verification attempts. Measure the success of whitebox and blackbox attacks in extracting 'deleted' information.
    Step 7: Evaluate Model Performance: Measure the impact of the defense methods on the model’s overall knowledge using metrics like Random ∆-Acc and Neighborhood ∆-Acc. Also, report the Rewrite Score to measure the effectiveness of the edits.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the effectiveness of different defense methods against various attacks. Analyze whether the proposed methods can effectively delete sensitive information and protect against extraction attacks.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1, "LLM-Prop: Predicting Physical And Electronic Properties of Crystalline Solids From Their Text Descriptions," tackles the problem of predicting crystal properties from text descriptions using large language models. The main strengths of this paper are:
1. It addresses the limitations of current graph neural network-based methods in modeling complex interactions within crystals.
2. The proposed method leverages the expressive power of text data and the general-purpose learning capabilities of LLMs to improve the prediction of crystal properties.
3. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured, including data preprocessing, model finetuning, and comprehensive comparisons with existing methods.

However, the paper lacks a detailed discussion on the interpretability of the model's predictions and the potential limitations of relying solely on text descriptions for crystal property prediction.

Paper 2, "Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted From LLMs? Objectives for Defending Against Extraction Attacks," focuses on the critical issue of deleting sensitive information from pretrained language models to prevent its extraction through prompt attacks or whitebox attacks. The main strengths of this paper are:
1. It addresses a pressing concern in the field of LLMs, as the presence of sensitive information in these models can lead to privacy violations and potential harm.
2. The proposed attack-and-defense framework provides a systematic approach to studying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from model weights.
3. The paper introduces novel defense methods to protect against extraction attacks and evaluates their effectiveness against various attack scenarios.

However, the paper does not provide a universally effective defense method, and the impact of the proposed methods on the model's overall knowledge and performance needs further investigation.

Considering the novelty, potential impact, and the thoroughness of the proposed methodology, Paper 2 appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The problem of deleting sensitive information from LLMs is a critical challenge that has far-reaching implications for the safe and responsible deployment of these models. The attack-and-defense framework introduced in Paper 2 provides a solid foundation for future research in this area and is likely to generate significant interest within the AI community.

paper 1:
Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks:
  Title: Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks
  Problem Statement: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length.
  Motivation: Existing methods like window attention, which cache only the most recent KVs, fail when the text length surpasses the cache size. This leads to a sharp decline in performance. The inspiration behind the new proposed method comes from the observation of an interesting phenomenon called 'attention sink,' where keeping the KV of initial tokens can largely recover the performance of window attention. The proposed method, StreamingLLM, leverages this phenomenon to enable LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning.
  Proposed Method: StreamingLLM is an efficient framework that keeps the attention sink (initial tokens) along with the most recent tokens in the KV cache. This method stabilizes the attention computation and maintains the model's performance over long texts. Additionally, adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on the concatenated PG19 test set, which contains 100 long books, and the StreamEval benchmark inspired by LongEval for streaming question-answering tasks.
    Step 2: Select Models: We use Llama-2-[7, 13, 70]B, MPT-[7, 30]B, Falcon-[7, 40]B, and Pythia-[2.9, 6.9, 12]B models. These models incorporate different position encoding techniques like RoPE and ALiBi.
    Step 3: Implement Baselines: We compare StreamingLLM against dense attention, window attention, and the sliding window approach with re-computation. Dense attention has O(T^2) time complexity, window attention caches the most recent tokens but fails when initial tokens are evicted, and sliding window with re-computation rebuilds the KV states for each new token but is computationally expensive.
    Step 4: Implement StreamingLLM: For StreamingLLM, we keep the attention sink (initial tokens) along with the most recent tokens in the KV cache. We use four initial tokens as attention sinks unless stated otherwise. The relative distance and positional information are determined within the cache rather than the original text.
    Step 5: Pre-train Models with Sink Tokens: We pre-train three language models with 160 million parameters from scratch under identical settings. One model uses standard SoftMax attention (Vanilla), the second uses SoftMax 1 (Zero Sink), and the third prepends a learnable placeholder token (Sink Token) in all training samples.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the PG19 test set and StreamEval benchmark. Measure language modeling perplexity and streaming performance. Compare the results of StreamingLLM with the baselines.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze whether StreamingLLM improves the performance of LLMs in streaming applications. Compare the efficiency in terms of decoding latency and memory usage. Validate the effectiveness of pre-training with sink tokens by comparing the streaming perplexity and zero-shot accuracy on various NLP benchmarks.


paper 2:
FreeLM: Fine-Tuning-Free Language Model:
  Title: FreeLM: Fine-Tuning-Free Language Model
  Problem Statement: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable success in NLP tasks, but the mainstream pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm incurs high deployment costs and low training efficiency. Fine-tuning on specific tasks is essential because PLMs are only pre-trained with language signals from large raw data.
  Motivation: Existing methods like zero-shot and few-shot models, including GPT-3 and InstructGPT, do not perform satisfactorily on understanding tasks because they are trained only with language signals, which are not task-aware. Instruction-tuning-based models improve zero-shot performance but still require adaptation for best performance on specific tasks. The proposed method, FreeLM, aims to address these issues by incorporating both language signals and task-aware teacher signals in a fine-tuning-free manner, thereby reducing costs and improving generalization and robustness.
  Proposed Method: FreeLM is a fine-tuning-free language model that integrates both language signals and teacher signals. Teacher signals are abstractions of downstream tasks provided in a unified proposition format. The model is trained iteratively, alternating between learning from large raw language data and unified task-aware data. This iterative training helps FreeLM handle pre-defined tasks with high accuracy and generalize well to unseen tasks. The unified proposition format facilitates mutual improvements among tasks, contributing to better generalization and robustness.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For language data, use the OpenWebText dataset. For unified data, use 30 datasets from seven tasks: question answering, paraphrasing, topic classification, story cloze, sentiment classification, natural language inference, and linguistic acceptability.
    Step 2: Construct Unified Data: Transform each task into a 'proposition correctness judgment' task. For each instance, design candidate templates and convert the class label into a natural language description. Construct positive and negative samples for training.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the medium version of GPT-2 with 345M parameters as the base model for FreeLM. Initialize the model with pre-trained parameters from HuggingFace.
    Step 4: Training Objective: Train the model with two objectives: (1) maximize the likelihood of predicted tokens for language data, and (2) minimize the cross-entropy of judging proposition correctness for unified data. Alternate between these two training stages.
    Step 5: Evaluate Language Understanding: Evaluate FreeLM on the GLUE benchmark, excluding WNLI and Ax due to dataset issues. Compare FreeLM against GPT-2, GPT-3, and InstructGPT in zero-shot and few-shot settings.
    Step 6: Evaluate Language Generation: Evaluate the generation performance of FreeLM against GPT-2 using perplexity (PPL) on LAMBADA, WikiText2, and PTB datasets. Conduct a case study on the StoryCloze dataset to assess the consistency of generated text.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of FreeLM with baselines on both understanding and generation tasks. Analyze the impact of iterative training, the proposition format, and the generalization ability on unseen tasks.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers propose novel approaches to address challenges in language modeling. Paper 1 focuses on efficient streaming language models for long-text applications, while Paper 2 introduces a fine-tuning-free language model that incorporates both language signals and task-aware teacher signals.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the critical problem of deploying LLMs in streaming applications with long interactions.
- Proposes an efficient framework, StreamingLLM, which leverages the 'attention sink' phenomenon to enable generalization to infinite sequence lengths without fine-tuning.
- Comprehensive experiment plan, including evaluation on diverse datasets and comparison with strong baselines.
- Potential to improve the efficiency of LLMs in terms of decoding latency and memory usage.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The effectiveness of the proposed method may depend on the specific architecture and position encoding techniques of the LLMs.
- The impact of pre-training with sink tokens on the model's performance in non-streaming tasks is not explicitly addressed.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles the high deployment costs and low training efficiency of the pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm.
- Proposes FreeLM, a fine-tuning-free language model that integrates language signals and task-aware teacher signals in a unified proposition format.
- Iterative training approach to improve generalization and robustness across tasks.
- Comprehensive evaluation plan on both language understanding and generation tasks.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The construction of unified data and the design of candidate templates for each task may require significant manual effort and domain expertise.
- The effectiveness of the proposed method on more complex and diverse tasks beyond the seven considered is not demonstrated.

Comparing the two papers, Paper 1 addresses a more pressing and well-defined problem in the deployment of LLMs for streaming applications. The proposed StreamingLLM framework is innovative, leveraging the 'attention sink' phenomenon to enable efficient and effective streaming language modeling. The experiment plan is comprehensive and includes evaluation on diverse datasets and comparison with strong baselines.

In contrast, while Paper 2 introduces an interesting approach to fine-tuning-free language modeling, the problem it addresses is less critical, and the proposed method relies heavily on the manual construction of unified data and candidate templates for each task. The effectiveness of FreeLM on a wider range of tasks is also not demonstrated.

Therefore, considering the novelty, potential impact, and the well-defined problem it addresses, Paper 1 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

Word Importance Explains How Prompts Affect Language Model Outputs:
  Title: Word Importance Explains How Prompts Affect Language Model Outputs
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications but their 'black box' nature hinders understanding of how they make specific decisions. This lack of transparency raises concerns about their reliability and ethical use.
  Motivation: Existing methods like classical attention mechanisms do not adequately explain the impact of individual words on model outputs, especially when attention weights are not available. Inspired by permutation importance for tabular data, the proposed method aims to measure the statistical impact of individual words in prompts on LLM outputs. This approach is expected to provide a more granular understanding of model behavior, enabling the decomposition of word importance into specific measures of interest such as bias, reading level, and verbosity.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves systematically masking each word in the system prompt and evaluating its effect on the model outputs based on user-defined text scores. The steps include: 1) Establishing baseline scores using the unmodified system prompt, 2) Masking each word in the prompt one at a time, 3) Generating outputs with the modified prompt, 4) Calculating the deviation from the baseline scores to determine the word's importance. This method is text score agnostic, meaning any scoring function can be used to ascertain word importance.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use two types of datasets: artificial data generated using GPT-4 and questions from the SQuAD 2 dataset. The artificial dataset includes system prompts, user inputs, and associated topics. The SQuAD 2 dataset contains human-generated questions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the artificial dataset, system prompts are combined with user inputs. Example: System prompt: 'You answer like Al Gore.' User input: 'What are the benefits of a plant-based diet?' For SQuAD 2, use a fixed system prompt: 'Answer truthfully.'
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-3.5 Turbo (16K, version 0613) and Llama2-13B (llama2-13b-chat-hf).
    Step 4: Define Text Scores: Use Flesch reading-ease, word count, and topic similarity as scoring functions. Topic similarity is computed using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model from the Hugging Face sentence-transformers library.
    Step 5: Introduce Suffixes: For each system prompt, introduce suffixes to discern their effect on the output. Example suffixes: 'Give a detailed answer' (evaluated by word count), 'Prefer technical terms' (evaluated by Flesch reading-ease), 'Focus on how [COMPANY] could help' (evaluated by topic similarity).
    Step 6: Generate Outputs: Generate outputs for each combination of system prompt, user input, and suffix. Compute the baseline and modified scores for each output.
    Step 7: Calculate Word Importance: For each word in the system prompt, calculate the word importance score by comparing the baseline and modified scores. Use the formula: w(k) = (1/NM) Σ|f(m(s, uj)) - f(m(sk, uj))|.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Plot the relationship between the impact of a suffix and the maximum word importance of words from the suffix. Use scatterplots to visualize the correlation and calculate Pearson correlation coefficients.

Label-free Node Classification on Graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs):
  Title: Label-free Node Classification on Graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs)
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of node classification on graphs without relying on labeled data. Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require abundant high-quality labels to perform well, which is often impractical due to the high cost and time required for labeling. The problem is interesting and important because it aims to leverage the zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce the dependency on labeled data, thereby making node classification more scalable and cost-effective.
  Motivation: Existing methods like GNNs perform well but require a large number of high-quality labels, which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. On the other hand, LLMs can perform zero-shot classification on text-attributed graphs but struggle with structural data and have high inference costs. The proposed method, LLM-GNN, aims to combine the strengths of both GNNs and LLMs while mitigating their limitations. By using LLMs to annotate a small portion of nodes and then training GNNs on these annotations, the method aims to achieve high performance with lower costs.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, LLM-GNN, involves the following steps: 1) Active node selection to identify nodes for LLM annotation based on a difficulty-aware heuristic. 2) Using LLMs to generate confidence-aware annotations for the selected nodes. 3) Optional post-filtering to remove low-quality annotations based on confidence scores. 4) Training GNNs on the high-quality annotated nodes and using them to predict labels for the remaining nodes. The method leverages the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and the structural learning capabilities of GNNs to achieve effective node classification with minimal labeling costs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the following datasets for evaluation: CORA, CITESEER, PUBMED, OGBN-ARXIV, OGBN-PRODUCTS, and WIKICS. These datasets are widely adopted for node classification tasks and provide a variety of graph structures and text attributes.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Design prompts for LLMs to generate annotations. For example, for zero-shot hybrid strategy: 'Question: (Contents) Paper: Title: [Title] Abstract: [Abstract] Task: There are following categories: [List of categories] What’s the category of this paper? Provide your 3 best guesses and a confidence number that each is correct (0 to 100) for the following question from most probable to least. The sum of all confidence should be 100. For example, [{"answer": <your first answer>, "confidence": <confidence for first answer>}, ... ]'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 for generating annotations. For GNN training, use the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model. The GCN model is chosen for its popularity and effectiveness in node classification tasks.
    Step 4: Active Node Selection: Implement difficulty-aware active node selection by calculating the C-Density heuristic for each node. Select nodes with high C-Density scores for LLM annotation. For example, C-Density (vi) = 1 / (1 + ||xvi - xCCvi||), where xvi is the feature of node vi and xCCvi is the feature of its closest cluster center.
    Step 5: Generate Annotations: Use the selected nodes and the designed prompts to generate annotations with LLMs. Ensure that the annotations include confidence scores to reflect the quality of the labels.
    Step 6: Post-Filtering: Optionally, apply post-filtering to remove low-quality annotations based on confidence scores. Use a score function that combines confidence scores and change of entropy (COE) to balance label diversity and annotation quality. For example, ffilter(vi) = β0 * rfconf(vi) + β1 * rCOE(vi) + β2 * rC-Density(vi).
    Step 7: GNN Training and Prediction: Train the GCN model on the high-quality annotated nodes using a weighted cross-entropy loss function, where the weights are derived from the confidence scores. After training, use the GCN model to predict labels for the remaining nodes in the graph.
    Step 8: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the trained GCN model on the test set using accuracy as the metric. Compare the results with other label-free node classification methods and analyze the cost-effectiveness of the proposed method.
    Step 9: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LLM-GNN with other baseline methods like SES, TAG-Z, BART-large-MNLI, and LLMs-as-Predictors. Analyze the impact of different budgets on the performance and cost of LLM-GNN. Investigate the characteristics of LLMs' annotations and their effect on the training dynamics of GNNs.

Both papers address important problems in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and propose novel methods to tackle them. However, there are some key differences in the strengths and weaknesses of each paper.

Paper 1 focuses on explaining how prompts affect the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method of measuring word importance by systematically masking words in the prompt and evaluating the effect on model outputs is a novel and potentially effective approach. The method is text score agnostic, allowing for flexibility in the choice of scoring functions. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured and includes a diverse set of datasets, models, and scoring functions. The analysis of the relationship between suffix impact and word importance could provide valuable insights into the inner workings of LLMs.

However, the paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing methods for explaining LLM behavior, such as attention mechanisms. It would be beneficial to discuss how the proposed method addresses the limitations of these existing approaches. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed method.

Paper 2 tackles the challenge of label-free node classification on graphs using LLMs. The proposed LLM-GNN method leverages the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs to generate annotations for a small portion of nodes and then trains Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on these annotations. This approach aims to reduce the dependency on labeled data while maintaining high performance. The paper provides a well-defined problem statement, motivation, and proposed method. The experiment plan is comprehensive and includes a diverse set of datasets and evaluation metrics.

The strengths of Paper 2 lie in its novel combination of LLMs and GNNs to address the limitations of both approaches. The active node selection and post-filtering steps help to ensure the quality of the annotations generated by LLMs. The comparison with other label-free node classification methods provides a clear benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational costs associated with using LLMs for annotation generation. It would be helpful to provide a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed method compared to traditional labeling approaches. Additionally, the paper could explore the scalability of the method to larger graphs and the potential impact of domain-specific knowledge on the performance of LLM-GNN.

In conclusion, while both papers make valuable contributions to the field of NLP, Paper 2 appears to have a slight edge due to its novel combination of LLMs and GNNs, comprehensive experiment plan, and clear comparison with existing methods. The potential impact of the LLM-GNN method on reducing the dependency on labeled data for node classification tasks is significant and could have wide-ranging applications in various domains.

Image2Sentence based Asymmetrical Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval:
  Title: Image2Sentence based Asymmetrical Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval
  Problem Statement: The task of composed image retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve images based on a query image and a text modifier describing the user's intent. Existing methods face two main issues: the lack of labeled triplets for model training and the difficulty of deploying large vision-language (VL) models in resource-restricted environments.
  Motivation: Existing CIR methods have made progress using advanced large VL models but suffer from data scarcity and deployment challenges. The lack of labeled triplets makes it hard to train models effectively, and the large size of VL models makes them impractical for deployment on devices with limited resources. The proposed method, Image2Sentence based Asymmetric zero-shot composed image retrieval (ISA), leverages the VL model while relying only on unlabeled images for composition learning. This approach is expected to work better by using an adaptive token learner to map images to sentences in the word embedding space, thus capturing discriminative visual information more effectively and allowing for flexible deployment with an asymmetric structure.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, ISA, involves several key components: 1) An adaptive token learner that maps an image to a sentence in the word embedding space of the VL model, capturing discriminative visual information. 2) An asymmetric structure where a lightweight model is used on the query side (user's device) and a large VL model is used on the gallery side (cloud server). 3) Global contrastive distillation and local alignment regularization to align the lightweight model with the large VL model, ensuring effective CIR. The adaptive token learner uses spatial attention to filter out noise and focus on distinctive visual patterns, mapping them to sentence tokens that are then integrated with the text modifier for retrieval.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use three datasets for evaluation: CIRR (natural domain), FashionIQ (fashion domain), and CIRCO (synthetic domain). CIRR includes 21,552 images and 36,554 triplets, FashionIQ includes 77,684 images divided into three categories (Dress, Toptee, Shirt), and CIRCO is collected from MSCOCO with 120k images.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use the BLIP model pre-trained on 129M image-text pairs as the multi-modal foundation model. For the lightweight visual encoder, use models like EfficientNet B2 and EfficientViT M2. The large visual and text encoders from BLIP are used on the gallery side.
    Step 3: Model Architecture and Training Objectives:
      Light Visual Encoder and Adaptive Token Learner: Extract visual feature maps from input images using a lightweight visual encoder. Use the adaptive token learner to map these features to sentence tokens in the word embedding space, employing spatial attention to focus on discriminative visual patterns.
      Global Contrastive Distillation (GCD): Align the textual feature obtained from sentence tokens with the corresponding image feature extracted by the large visual encoder. Use cross-entropy loss to ensure alignment.
      Local Alignment Regularization (LAR): Enhance the semantic alignment of sentence tokens with visual information by feeding them into the matching encoder along with the visual feature map. Use binary cross-entropy loss for local alignment.
    Step 4: Training Procedure: Train the framework for 20 epochs using AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 3e-4. Use 5 epochs of linear warm-up followed by 15 epochs of cosine annealing. The batch size is set to 320.
    Step 5: Inference Workflow: Deploy the lightweight visual encoder and adaptive token learner on mobile devices. The large visual and text encoders are deployed on the cloud server. During inference, convert the query image into sentence tokens, concatenate them with the text modifier, and upload the composed query to the cloud server for retrieval. The large text encoder extracts the composed query feature, and the large visual encoder extracts features of database images offline.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the performance on the test sets of CIRR and CIRCO, and the validation set of FashionIQ. Compare the results with baselines and state-of-the-art methods like Pic2word and SEARLE.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the retrieval accuracy and efficiency, comparing the proposed method with baselines and existing methods. Evaluate the impact of different components like the adaptive token learner, GCD, and LAR on the performance.

Control Theory of LLM Prompting:
  Title: What's the Magic Word? A Control Theory of LLM Prompting
  Problem Statement: Prompt engineering is effective and important in the deployment of large language models (LLMs) but is poorly understood mathematically. The paper aims to formalize prompt engineering as an optimal control problem on LLMs, where the prompt is considered a control variable for modulating the output distribution of the LLM. The central question is whether there always exists a prompt that can steer the LLM toward accurately predicting a given final token.
  Motivation: Existing methods for prompt engineering are largely heuristic and lack a rigorous mathematical foundation. This gap in understanding limits the ability to systematically design prompts that can reliably control LLM outputs. The inspiration behind the proposed method comes from control theory, which provides a well-established framework for understanding and designing control systems. By applying control theory to LLMs, the authors aim to develop a more principled approach to prompt engineering that can offer guarantees on the controllability of LLM outputs.
  Proposed Method: The authors propose to formalize LLM systems as discrete stochastic dynamical systems and explore prompt engineering through the lens of control theory. They define the reachable set of output token sequences for which there exists a control input sequence that steers the LLM to output the desired token. They introduce a metric called $k - 	ext{epsilon}$ controllability to characterize LLM steerability. The method involves both analytic and empirical analysis. Analytically, they prove a bound on the controllability of a self-attention head as a function of the singular values of its weight matrices. Empirically, they compute the $k-	ext{epsilon}$ controllability of several LLMs on WikiText causal language modeling tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments use the WikiText dataset for causal language modeling tasks. Specifically, they sample initial states from the dataset to probe the reachable output tokens.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each initial state-output pair, the authors use prompt optimization algorithms to generate optimal prompts. They apply two methods: Greedy Back-Generation for short prompts (k ≤ 3 tokens) and Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) for longer prompts (k > 3 tokens).
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments are conducted on a panel of large language models, including Falcon-7b, Llama-7b, and Falcon-40b.
    Step 4: Get Results: The authors measure the $k-	ext{epsilon}$ controllability by determining the proportion of instances where the correct next token is reachable with prompts of varying lengths. They also explore the reachable set by sampling target output tokens based on the LLM's initial estimate of output likelihood.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: The results show that magic words of 10 tokens or less exist for over 97% of WikiText instances surveyed for each model. They also find that the top 75 most likely next tokens are reachable at least 85% of the time with prompts of 10 tokens or less. The analysis highlights the significant role of input sequences in steering output probabilities and offers insights into the controllability of LLMs.

Weaknesses of Control Theory of LLM Prompting:
1. The experiments are limited to the WikiText dataset and causal language modeling tasks, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world applications.
2. The scalability of the proposed prompt optimization algorithms (Greedy Back-Generation and Greedy Coordinate Gradient) to larger datasets and more complex tasks is not thoroughly discussed.

Conclusion:
While both papers make significant contributions to their respective fields, the Control Theory of LLM Prompting paper stands out as the more impactful and innovative work. By formalizing prompt engineering as an optimal control problem and introducing the concept of $k-	ext{epsilon}$ controllability, the authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for understanding and designing prompts that can reliably control LLM outputs. The combination of analytic and empirical analysis, along with the experiments on multiple large language models, strengthens the validity of their findings. In contrast, the ISA paper, although addressing important challenges in CIR, relies more on existing techniques and lacks the same level of theoretical novelty.

paper 1:
Ferret: Refer and Ground Anything Anywhere at Any Granularity:
  Title: Ferret: Refer and Ground Anything Anywhere at Any Granularity
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of enabling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand and ground spatial referring expressions of any shape or granularity within an image. This problem is crucial because current MLLMs struggle with accurately grounding open-vocabulary descriptions and handling diverse region inputs, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where precise spatial understanding is required.
  Motivation: Existing methods typically handle referring and grounding tasks separately and often rely on fixed region representations like bounding boxes. These approaches are insufficient for handling the diverse and complex shapes of regions that humans use for referring. The proposed method, Ferret, aims to unify referring and grounding within a single framework by employing a novel hybrid region representation that integrates discrete coordinates and continuous features. This approach is inspired by the need for more versatile and precise human-model interactions and is expected to outperform existing baselines by enabling fine-grained and open-vocabulary referring and grounding.
  Proposed Method: Ferret employs a hybrid region representation that combines discrete coordinates and continuous visual features to represent regions in an image. A spatial-aware visual sampler is introduced to handle varying sparsity across different shapes, allowing Ferret to accept diverse region inputs such as points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes. The model is trained using GRIT, a comprehensive refer-and-ground instruction tuning dataset, which includes 1.1M samples with rich hierarchical spatial knowledge and 130K hard negative data to enhance robustness. Ferret can generate bounding box coordinates for groundable objects in its output, seamlessly integrating referring and grounding capabilities.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The GRIT dataset is used for training, which includes 1.1M samples covering objects, relationships, region descriptions, and complex reasoning. Additionally, 130K hard negative samples are included to promote model robustness. For evaluation, datasets like LVIS for referring object classification, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg for referring expression comprehension, and Flickr30k Entities for phrase grounding and grounded captioning are used.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: Ferret consists of an image encoder (CLIP-ViT-L/14), a spatial-aware visual sampler, and a language model (Vicuna). The image encoder extracts image embeddings, the visual sampler extracts continuous features for regions, and the language model processes the combined text and region features.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: Ferret is trained to perform both referring and grounding tasks. For referring, the model is trained to classify objects within specified regions. For grounding, the model is trained to generate bounding box coordinates for objects mentioned in the text. The training process involves alternating between these tasks to ensure mutual benefits.
    Step 4: Construct Prompts: For referring tasks, prompts are constructed to ask the model to classify objects within specified regions (e.g., 'Is the object [region0] a refrigerator or a chair?'). For grounding tasks, prompts ask the model to locate objects based on descriptions (e.g., 'What are the locations of a man, a trail, a young girl, some boards of wood?').
    Step 5: Select Models: Ferret-7B and Ferret-13B are the two main model variants used in the experiments. These models are compared against existing MLLMs like LLaVA, Kosmos-2, and Shikra.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the selected datasets for both referring and grounding tasks. Metrics such as accuracy for referring object classification and F1 scores for grounding are used to measure performance.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Ferret against existing baselines. Analyze improvements in referring and grounding capabilities, as well as the model's ability to handle diverse region inputs and reduce object hallucination.


paper 2:
Video2Demo:
  Title: Video2Demo: Grounding Videos in State-Action Demonstrations
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of teaching robots everyday tasks through vision-language demonstrations. For effective imitation learning, these demonstrations need to be perceptually grounded in the robot's states and actions. Existing methods often require extensive manual annotation and fail to generalize to complex scenes.
  Motivation: Prior works train task-specific models to predict state-actions from images, but these methods require significant human annotation and struggle to generalize to complex, real-world scenes. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot generalization for detailed caption generation, but their captions lack the structure and temporal consistency needed to track object states over time. The proposed method leverages the reasoning capabilities of GPT-4 to interactively query a VLM, thereby constructing temporally coherent state-action sequences. This approach aims to outperform pure VLM-based methods by generating more accurate robot task code.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Video2Demo, uses GPT-4 to interactively query a generative VLM to construct temporally coherent state-action sequences. These sequences are then fed into a language model to generate robot task code that faithfully imitates the demonstration. The process involves two phases: (1) Information Extraction via Interactive VQA, where GPT-4 engages in an interactive visual question-answering session with the VLM to extract salient information from each image, and (2) State-Action Prediction, where GPT-4 uses the extracted information to predict the current states and actions.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on the EPIC-Kitchens dataset, a large-scale human activity dataset that includes egocentric videos of humans performing daily chores in their kitchens. The dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in generating state-action sequences and robot task code.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Phase I Prompts:
        - What objects are in this timestep?
        - Can you tell me about the statuses of the slow cooker and the plate, as well as the relationship between the human and these two objects?
        - Could you please tell me about the locations and statuses of the slow cooker, plate, spoon, and curry in this image? Additionally, describe the human’s interaction with these objects, as well as the positional relationship among these objects.
        - Does the plate still remain empty after the human’s interaction with the slow cooker and spoon? Can you verify if the curry was transferred from the slow cooker to the plate?
        - Please describe the statuses of the slow cooker and the spoon. Also, could you tell me whether the human has interacted with either the slow cooker or the spoon in any way besides holding them?
      Phase II Prompts:
        - Based on the VA’s responses, it is evident that the slow cooker is on the stove and filled with curry, while the human is holding an empty plate and a spoon. The person is positioned in proximity to the slow cooker, preparing to serve themselves some curry. Although the action in the previous timestep suggests that the individual is about to serve the food onto the plate from the slow cooker, there is no actual confirmation of this action taking place. The VA reiterated multiple times that the plate remains empty, implying that the dish was not transferred onto it yet. Consequently, the start and end states of this timestep do not reflect a change in the condition of the plate.
        - After comparing the start and end states of this timestep, I notice there is no change in states, which suggests that the action carried out in this timestep might be related to holding objects in preparation for a subsequent action, rather than changing the states of the objects themselves. In the chat logs, the VA confirms that the person is holding a spoon and a plate, standing near a slow cooker filled with curry, but has not moved or transferred the curry on the plate. Considering all these aspects, it seems like the person is about to serve the curry from the slow cooker onto the plate, but the action has not been performed yet. This suggests the action in this timestep is 'prepare_to_serve_from'.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used in the experiments include GPT-4 for reasoning and querying, and LLaVA (a generative VLM fine-tuned on large amounts of image-conversation paired data) for visual question answering.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate state-action sequences and robot task code using the proposed method and compare them against baselines. The baselines include SM-CAPTION, which uses VLM-generated captions, and SM-FIXED-Q, which uses a fixed set of questions to query the VLM.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the EPIC-Kitchens dataset by comparing action accuracy and state recall against the baselines. Additionally, assess the quality of the generated robot task code using metrics such as ChrF scores and CodeBERT scores.

Both papers address important challenges in the field of multimodal learning and human-robot interaction. However, they differ in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1, "Ferret: Refer and Ground Anything Anywhere at Any Granularity," presents a novel approach to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand and ground spatial referring expressions of any shape or granularity within an image. The proposed method, Ferret, employs a hybrid region representation that combines discrete coordinates and continuous visual features, allowing it to handle diverse region inputs and generate bounding box coordinates for groundable objects. The paper's strengths lie in its comprehensive training dataset (GRIT), the model's ability to unify referring and grounding tasks, and its potential to enhance human-model interactions in real-world scenarios.

Paper 2, "Video2Demo: Grounding Videos in State-Action Demonstrations," focuses on teaching robots everyday tasks through vision-language demonstrations. The proposed method, Video2Demo, leverages the reasoning capabilities of GPT-4 to interactively query a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and construct temporally coherent state-action sequences. While the paper addresses an important challenge in robot imitation learning, its reliance on GPT-4 for reasoning and querying may limit its scalability and reproducibility.

Comparing the two papers, Paper 1 (Ferret) appears to have a broader impact and more significant contributions to the field of multimodal learning. The proposed method's ability to handle diverse region inputs and accurately ground open-vocabulary descriptions is a major advancement over existing approaches. Moreover, the comprehensive training dataset and the model's unified referring and grounding capabilities make it a strong candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.

In contrast, Paper 2 (Video2Demo) has a narrower focus on robot imitation learning and relies heavily on GPT-4, which may not be accessible to all researchers. While the interactive visual question-answering approach is novel, the paper's overall impact and generalizability seem more limited compared to Paper 1.

Inductive Transformers:
  Title: Inductive Transformers: How Large Language Models Form Concepts, And How to Make Them Even Better At It
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of improving the conceptual organization, control, and abstraction in transformer models. The goal is to design transformers that can learn better-organized, more controllable, and more abstract concepts, which can enhance abilities such as causal reasoning, iterative experimentation, long-range planning, curiosity, and introspection.
  Motivation: Existing transformer models, while powerful, often require extreme quantities of data and reinforcement to organize internal concepts reliably. Human learners, by contrast, can achieve deep abstractions and conceptual clarity with significantly less data. Current methods focus on expanding data modalities or increasing model size, which is not always efficient. The proposed method introduces inductive bias into transformers, which can enhance their predictive power and reduce the need for large amounts of high-quality data. Inductive bias can help models learn more efficiently by shaping them to fit high-quality data better and making them a poorer fit for low-quality data.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves designing additional inductive bias into transformers by making modest modifications to their activation functions and connectivity. This approach includes generating synthetic training data to pre-train inductive bias into a transformer. The method focuses on understanding transformers from a foundational perspective and designing new inductive bias to yield inductive transformers. The inductive transformer model is derived by marginalizing a generative statistical model, which provides a foundation for designing new inductive bias. The method also involves modifying the feed-forward layers and connectivity between the encoder and decoder to align with the inductive bias.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The paper does not specify particular datasets but mentions the use of synthetic training data to pre-train inductive bias into transformers. For practical implementation, one could use standard NLP datasets such as Wikipedia, Common Crawl, or domain-specific datasets.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as the paper does not involve prompting. Instead, focus on the model architecture and training objectives.
    Step 3: Model Architecture: Implement the inductive transformer model with the following components:
1. Encoder and decoder layers with modified activation functions and connectivity.
2. Open-closed universe factors to represent open universe models within a closed universe neural network.
3. Bernoulli-Categorical factors to transform between Bernoulli and categorical representations.
4. Self-attention mechanism derived from the generative statistical model.
5. Feed-forward layers designed to implement specific inductive bias functions.
    Step 4: Training Objectives: Train the inductive transformer model using back-propagation with the Adam optimizer. Use synthetic training data to pre-train the model with inductive bias. Fine-tune the model on natural language training data.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the model's performance on standard NLP tasks such as language modeling, text classification, and question answering. Compare the performance of the inductive transformer with baseline transformer models.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze whether the inductive transformer shows improved conceptual organization, control, and abstraction compared to baseline models. Evaluate the model's performance on tasks requiring causal reasoning, iterative experimentation, long-range planning, curiosity, and introspection. Assess the model's identifiability and controllability by examining if it learns concepts in a repeatable and localized manner.

Frozen Transformers in Language Models Are Effective Visual Encoder Layers:
  Title: Frozen Transformers in Language Models Are Effective Visual Encoder Layers
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of leveraging large language models (LLMs), which are traditionally trained on text data, as effective encoders for purely visual tasks. This is intriguing because it challenges the conventional approach that typically requires multi-modal vision-language setups.
  Motivation: Existing methods for visual tasks often rely on multi-modal setups that incorporate both vision and language data, necessitating complex architectures and large amounts of multi-modal training data. These methods are not only resource-intensive but also limited by the availability of annotated multi-modal datasets. The inspiration behind the proposed method is the observation that LLMs, despite being trained solely on text, have the potential to process visual tokens effectively. The proposed method leverages pre-trained LLM transformer blocks in a frozen state, hypothesizing that these blocks can filter and amplify informative visual tokens, thereby enhancing performance across a variety of visual tasks.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves incorporating a frozen transformer block from a pre-trained LLM as a visual encoder layer. The essential steps are: (1) Extract a frozen LLM transformer block and append it to the original visual encoder. (2) Insert trainable linear layers before and after the LLM block to align feature dimensions. (3) Freeze the LLM transformer block while optimizing the other modules during training. This approach is hypothesized to work better because the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks can discern and amplify informative visual tokens, leading to improved performance on visual tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments cover a wide range of tasks: ImageNet1k for image classification, ScanObjectNN and ModelNet40 for point cloud classification, Something-something-v2 (SSv2) for action recognition, Argoverse for motion forecasting, VQAv2 for 2D visual question answering, and SQA3D for 3D visual question answering.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: For each task, the architecture involves a visual encoder (e.g., ViT for image classification, Point-BERT for point cloud classification) with a frozen LLM transformer block appended. Two linear layers are added before and after the LLM block to align feature dimensions.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: The training objectives vary by task but generally involve optimizing classification accuracy, action recognition accuracy, motion forecasting metrics (ADE, FDE, MR), and question answering accuracy (EM@1, EM@10).
    Step 4: Training Configuration: For image classification, follow the DeiT training setup with 300 epochs, a base learning rate of 5e-4, and AdamW optimizer. For point cloud classification, fine-tune Point-BERT with a learning rate of 5e-4 for 300 epochs. For action recognition, initialize ViT from VideoMAE pre-training and fine-tune for 30-40 epochs. For motion forecasting, train VectorNet and mmTransformer with AdamW optimizer and cosine annealing learning rate schedule. For 2D and 3D VQA, initialize image encoder from CLIP-B/32 and text encoder from RoBERTa, then fine-tune on VQAv2 and SQA3D datasets.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the respective datasets and collect metrics such as accuracy for classification tasks, ADE, FDE, MR for motion forecasting, and EM@1, EM@10 for VQA tasks.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the baseline models with the models incorporating the frozen LLM transformer blocks. Analyze whether the proposed method improves the performance across different tasks and datasets.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The motivation behind using frozen LLM transformer blocks for visual tasks may not be as strong as the motivation for improving conceptual organization and abstraction in Paper 1.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 2 appears to be the more promising and well-structured research proposal. The authors of Paper 2 provide a clear and comprehensive experiment plan, covering a diverse set of visual tasks and datasets. They also propose a novel approach of leveraging frozen LLM transformer blocks, which has the potential to improve performance across various visual tasks without the need for multi-modal setups. Furthermore, the authors of Paper 2 include specific evaluation metrics and benchmarks, allowing for a rigorous assessment of their proposed method.

In contrast, while Paper 1 addresses an important problem of improving conceptual organization and abstraction in transformer models, the experiment plan lacks specificity in terms of datasets and evaluation metrics. This makes it more challenging to assess the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed inductive transformer approach.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the comparative analysis, Paper 2 is more likely to be the accepted idea.

Learning Embodied Vision-Language Programming From Instruction, Exploration, and Environmental Feedback:
  Title: Learning Embodied Vision-Language Programming From Instruction, Exploration, and Environmental Feedback
  Problem Statement: The fusion of vision and language in recent vision-language models (VLMs) represents a significant advancement in multimodal comprehension and interpretation. However, integrating these models into embodied agents to create autonomous and context-aware systems capable of formulating plans and executing commands with precision remains a challenge.
  Motivation: Existing methods like SayCan, Palm-E, and RT-2 have made strides in robot manipulation by processing visual input and relaying precise robotic motor control commands. However, these approaches often rely on pre-trained vision models to convert vision content into language, which can hinder performance. Additionally, current methods lack the ability to seamlessly convert detailed plans into real-world actions. The proposed method, Octopus, aims to address these limitations by integrating vision and language to generate executable code, thereby enhancing the agent's decision-making and task execution capabilities.
  Proposed Method: Octopus is an embodied vision-language model designed to: 1) proficiently decipher an agent’s visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. The model is trained using GPT-4 to generate training data, including action blueprints and corresponding executable code, within an experimental environment called OctoVerse. OctoVerse provides instant feedback to refine the agent’s decision-making through a Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF) approach. The model architecture integrates a MPT-7B Language Decoder and a CLIP VIT-L/14 Vision Encoder, with design principles from the Flamingo architecture.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Develop two simulator environments under the OctoVerse framework: OctoGibson and OctoGTA. OctoGibson is built on OmniGibson and supports 1,000 daily activities across 50 scenes, featuring over 5,000 annotated objects. OctoGTA is built on GTA-V and includes 20 tasks designed to assess the model’s generalization capabilities.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For data collection, use GPT-4 to generate action plans and executable code based on detailed system and environment messages. The environment message includes attributes like Observed Objects, Observed Relations, and Inventory. The system message ensures consistent input and output formats for GPT-4.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the MPT-7B Language Decoder and CLIP VIT-L/14 Vision Encoder for the Octopus model. The model architecture incorporates the Perceiver Resampler module and Cross-Gated Attention modules for seamless integration of visual and textual data.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the model on 60 tasks in OctoGibson, with 45 from the seen environment and 15 from unseen environments. Metrics include goal task completion score and plan score from human evaluation. Additionally, test the model’s generalization on 11 tasks in the OctoGTA environment.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Octopus with other models like LLaMA, CodeLLaMA, TAPA, and EmbodiedGPT. Assess the impact of Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF) on the model’s reasoning capabilities and task completion rates. Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the significance of model components, model size, and visual inputs.

Sophia: A Scalable Stochastic Second-order Optimizer for Language Model Pre-training:
  Title: Sophia: A Scalable Stochastic Second-order Optimizer for Language Model Pre-training
  Problem Statement: The massive cost of language model pre-training necessitates improvements in optimization algorithms to reduce training time and cost. Current state-of-the-art optimizers like Adam and its variants have been dominant for years, but more sophisticated second-order (Hessian-based) optimizers often incur too much per-step overhead.
  Motivation: Adam and its variants, while effective, do not fully leverage second-order information due to the high computational cost. More sophisticated second-order optimizers, although potentially more efficient, are often impractical due to their overhead. The proposed method, Sophia, aims to bridge this gap by using a light-weight estimate of the diagonal Hessian as a pre-conditioner, which can significantly speed up training without incurring substantial overhead.
  Proposed Method: Sophia is a simple, scalable second-order optimizer that uses a light-weight estimate of the diagonal Hessian as the pre-conditioner. The update rule involves the moving average of the gradients divided by the moving average of the estimated Hessian, followed by element-wise clipping to control the worst-case update size. This approach mitigates the negative impact of non-convexity and rapid changes in the Hessian along the trajectory. Sophia estimates the diagonal Hessian every few iterations, resulting in negligible average per-step time and memory overhead.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on language modeling tasks using the OpenWebText dataset for GPT-2 models and the Pile dataset for GPT NeoX models.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT models of various sizes ranging from 125M to 1.5B parameters, including GPT-2 Small (125M), GPT-2 Medium (355M), GPT-2 Large (770M), and GPT NeoX (1.5B and 6.6B).
    Step 4: Implement Optimizer: Implement Sophia with the following hyperparameters: β1=0.96, β2=0.99, ϵ=1e-12, and update the diagonal Hessian every 10 steps. Use two options for diagonal Hessian estimators: Hutchinson’s unbiased estimator and Gauss-Newton-Bartlett (GNB) estimator.
    Step 5: Train Models: Train the models using Sophia and compare with AdamW and Lion optimizers. Use a batch size of 480 for GPT-2 and 2048 for GPT NeoX. Apply a cosine learning rate schedule with a fixed 2k steps of learning rate warm-up.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the models on validation loss (log perplexity) and few-shot performance on SuperGLUE tasks (BoolQ, CB, COPA, RTE). Use 2-shot prompting and greedy decoding for few-shot evaluation.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the number of steps, total compute, and wall-clock time needed to achieve the same validation loss. Analyze the scaling laws and the impact of model size on the performance of Sophia compared to AdamW and Lion.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose novel methods to address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus and potential impact.

Paper 1, "Learning Embodied Vision-Language Programming From Instruction, Exploration, and Environmental Feedback," presents a novel approach to integrating vision and language in embodied agents. The proposed Octopus model aims to enhance the agent's decision-making and task execution capabilities by generating executable code based on visual and textual task objectives. The paper's strengths lie in its comprehensive experiment plan, which includes the development of two simulator environments (OctoGibson and OctoGTA) and a well-designed model architecture that incorporates state-of-the-art components. The use of GPT-4 for data collection and the Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF) approach further strengthen the paper's methodology. The proposed evaluation metrics and ablation studies demonstrate a thorough analysis of the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

Paper 2, "Sophia: A Scalable Stochastic Second-order Optimizer for Language Model Pre-training," focuses on improving the efficiency of language model pre-training by introducing a novel optimizer. The proposed Sophia optimizer uses a light-weight estimate of the diagonal Hessian as a pre-conditioner to speed up training without incurring substantial overhead. The paper's strengths include its clear problem statement, motivation, and the simplicity of the proposed method. The experiment plan is well-structured, with a focus on comparing Sophia's performance with state-of-the-art optimizers like AdamW and Lion across various model sizes and datasets. The analysis of scaling laws and the impact of model size on the optimizer's performance further strengthens the paper's contributions.

While both papers make significant contributions to their respective sub-fields, Paper 1 has a broader impact on the field of embodied AI and multimodal learning. The integration of vision and language in embodied agents has the potential to enable more autonomous and context-aware systems, with applications in robotics, virtual assistants, and beyond. In contrast, Paper 2's contributions, although important for improving the efficiency of language model pre-training, have a more narrow scope within the field of optimization for large language models.

In conclusion, both papers present strong ideas and well-designed experiments. However, considering the broader impact and the potential to advance the field of embodied AI, Paper 1 is likely to be the accepted idea.

Llemma: An Open Language Model for Mathematics:
  Title: Llemma: An Open Language Model for Mathematics
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of creating a large language model specifically tailored for mathematical problem-solving. This problem is important because existing generalist language models, while capable of understanding and generating natural language, often fall short in specialized domains like mathematics, where precise reasoning and domain-specific knowledge are crucial.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as generalist language models, do not perform optimally in specialized domains like mathematics due to their broad training data and lack of domain-specific fine-tuning. Previous domain-specific models for mathematics have either been closed access, limiting their utility for further research, or have lagged behind the state-of-the-art. The proposed method, Llemma, aims to bridge this gap by continuing the pretraining of Code Llama on a diverse mixture of math-related text and code, thereby enhancing its mathematical capabilities. The open access nature of Llemma and its training data also provides a platform for future research and development in mathematical reasoning.
  Proposed Method: Llemma is created by continuing the pretraining of Code Llama on Proof-Pile-2, a dataset comprising scientific papers, web data containing mathematics, and mathematical code. The key contributions include: 1) Training and releasing 7 billion and 34 billion parameter models specialized for mathematics. 2) Releasing the AlgebraicStack, a dataset of 11 billion tokens of mathematical code. 3) Demonstrating Llemma's capability to use computational tools and perform formal theorem proving without further fine-tuning. 4) Making all artifacts, including models, datasets, and code, publicly available.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets used include Proof-Pile-2 (55 billion tokens), AlgebraicStack (11 billion tokens of mathematical code), OpenWebMath (15 billion tokens of high-quality web pages filtered for mathematical content), and the ArXiv subset of RedPajama (29 billion tokens).
    Step 2: Model Initialization: Initialize the models from Code Llama, which are decoder-only transformer language models further trained on 500 billion tokens of code.
    Step 3: Continue Pretraining: Continue training the Code Llama models on Proof-Pile-2 using a standard autoregressive language modeling objective. Train the 7B model for 200 billion tokens and the 34B model for 50 billion tokens.
    Step 4: Training Configuration: Train all models in bfloat16 mixed precision using the GPT-NeoX library across 256 A100 40GB GPUs. Use Tensor Parallelism with a world size of 2 for Llemma-7B and a world size of 8 for Llemma-34B, alongside ZeRO Stage 1 sharded optimizer states across Data Parallel replicas. Use Flash Attention 2 to improve throughput and reduce memory requirements.
    Step 5: Evaluation: Evaluate Llemma on various mathematical benchmarks including MATH, GSM8k, OCWCourses, MMLU-STEM, and SAT. Use few-shot evaluation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Additionally, evaluate Llemma's capability to use computational tools (Python interpreter and SymPy) and perform formal theorem proving (Isabelle and Lean proof assistants).
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare Llemma's performance with existing models like Minerva and Code Llama. Analyze the impact of continued pretraining on mathematical problem-solving capabilities. Study the effects of memorization and data mixture on performance. Conduct a preliminary study of supervised fine-tuning with Llemma on MetaMathQA.

Value-Guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search Decoding:
  Title: Making PPO even better: Value-Guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search decoding
  Problem Statement: While Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method for generating natural language text, it often discards the value network, which is a byproduct of PPO training. This leads to a fundamental mismatch between the scoring mechanisms of partial outputs during training and inference, resulting in suboptimal text generation.
  Motivation: Existing methods for controlled text generation using PPO typically discard the value network after training, relying solely on the policy network for inference. This approach can yield undesirable outputs because the value network, which evaluates partial sequences, is not utilized. The inspiration behind the new method is to integrate the value network with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to guide the decoding process, thereby reducing the mismatch between training and inference scoring mechanisms. The proposed method, PPO-MCTS, leverages the value network to improve the preferability of generated text, making it more aligned with human preferences.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, PPO-MCTS, integrates the value network from PPO with MCTS during inference-time generation. The key steps are: 1) Select: Use the PUCT algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation by selecting actions that favor high Q-function values while discounting high visit counts. 2) Expand: Expand the selected node and compute the prior policy distribution, linking actions with top-k priors to new child nodes. 3) Evaluate: Evaluate the value function of the selected node using the PPO value model and initialize the visit count and mean value. 4) Backup: Update the visit count, mean value, and Q-function for all nodes and edges on the path from the selected node back to the root. The final action is decoded from the normalized visit counts of the children of the root node.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on four text generation tasks: sentiment steering (OpenWebText dataset), toxicity reduction (RealToxicityPrompts dataset), knowledge introspection (several QA benchmarks), and creating helpful and harmless chatbots (HH-RLHF dataset).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used include GPT2-large for sentiment steering and toxicity reduction, T5-large for knowledge introspection, and LLaMA-7b for helpful and harmless chatbots. The PPO policy and value models are trained using these base models.
    Step 4: Training Objectives: For sentiment steering and toxicity reduction, the PPO models are trained using rewards from sentiment classifiers and PerspectiveAPI, respectively. For knowledge introspection, the reward model is derived from UnifiedQA. For helpful and harmless chatbots, the reward model is trained on helpfulness and harmlessness data.
    Step 5: Decoding Details: For each task, the MCTS decoding involves running a specified number of simulations per token with a branching factor. The expand stage applies a temperature to the policy prior to boost diversity, and the final token decision uses temperature sampling or greedy decoding. Specific hyperparameters such as the number of simulations (S), branching factor (k), and temperatures (τd and τe) are tuned for each task.
    Step 6: Get Results: Generate text using both the baseline PPO policy and the proposed PPO-MCTS method. Evaluate the generated text on metrics such as goal satisfaction rate, fluency, diversity, and human preferability.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of PPO-MCTS with the baseline PPO policy and other reward-improving strategies such as best-of-n decoding and longer PPO training. Conduct both automatic and human evaluations to assess the improvements in text preferability, fluency, and diversity.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers propose interesting methods to address challenges in their respective domains. However, the Llemma paper (Paper 1) appears to be a more significant contribution to the field of mathematical language modeling compared to the PPO-MCTS paper (Paper 2) in the context of controlled text generation.

Strengths of Paper 1 (Llemma):
1. Addresses a clear gap in the field by creating a large, open-access language model specifically tailored for mathematical problem-solving.
2. Proposes a novel approach of continuing the pretraining of Code Llama on a diverse mixture of math-related text and code, enhancing its mathematical capabilities.
3. Releases large-scale models (7B and 34B parameters) and datasets (AlgebraicStack with 11 billion tokens) to facilitate future research.
4. Demonstrates Llemma's capability to use computational tools and perform formal theorem proving without further fine-tuning.
5. Provides a comprehensive evaluation plan across various mathematical benchmarks and tasks.

Weaknesses of Paper 1 (Llemma):
1. The computational resources required for training and evaluating the models are substantial, which may limit reproducibility.
2. The paper does not explore the potential biases or limitations of the model in depth.

Strengths of Paper 2 (PPO-MCTS):
1. Proposes a novel approach to integrate the value network from PPO with MCTS during inference-time generation.
2. Addresses the mismatch between training and inference scoring mechanisms in existing PPO-based text generation methods.
3. Evaluates the proposed method across multiple text generation tasks, including sentiment steering, toxicity reduction, knowledge introspection, and creating helpful and harmless chatbots.

Weaknesses of Paper 2 (PPO-MCTS):
1. The improvements achieved by PPO-MCTS over the baseline PPO policy are not quantified clearly.
2. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between the proposed method and other reward-improving strategies.
3. The generalizability of the method to other base models and tasks is not extensively explored.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 1 (Llemma) appears to be a more significant contribution to its field. The creation of a large, open-access mathematical language model, along with the release of substantial datasets and the demonstration of its capabilities across various mathematical tasks, makes it a more impactful work compared to the incremental improvement proposed in Paper 2 (PPO-MCTS).

Stack Attention: Improving the Ability of Transformers to Model Hierarchical Patterns:
  Title: Stack Attention: Improving the Ability of Transformers to Model Hierarchical Patterns
  Problem Statement: Transformers, specifically those using scaled dot-product attention, are highly effective for natural language processing but lack mechanisms to handle hierarchical patterns of arbitrary nesting depth. This limitation restricts their ability to recognize certain syntactic structures, which are essential for understanding and generating human language.
  Motivation: Existing transformers struggle with recognizing hierarchical syntactic patterns due to their linear inductive bias and inability to handle nested structures beyond a bounded depth. This limitation is evident in their poor performance on context-free languages (CFLs) and their inefficiency in learning language compared to human children. The proposed method, stack attention, is inspired by the theoretical connections between stacks and context-free languages, aiming to incorporate a latent model of syntax into transformers without requiring syntactic supervision. This approach is expected to enhance the expressive power of transformers and improve their data efficiency and generalization capabilities.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, stack attention, integrates stacks into the attention mechanism of transformers. It treats input vectors as items in a stack and performs a soft-selection over sequences of stack actions. Two variants are proposed: one based on deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and another on nondeterministic PDAs. The superposition stack simulates fractionally-weighted stack actions, while the nondeterministic stack uses a differentiable vector PDA (dVPDA) to handle arbitrary CFLs. Both variants replace the standard multi-head scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) in transformers, allowing them to model hierarchical patterns more effectively.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on five context-free language (CFL) tasks: w#wR, wwR, wapwR, Dyck, and Hardest CFL. Additionally, the Penn Treebank dataset is used for natural language modeling, and a subset of the German-English Europarl v7 dataset is used for machine translation.
    Step 2: Construct Models: For each task, transformers with standard SDPA (Tf), superposition stack attention (Tf+Sup), and nondeterministic stack attention (Tf+Nd) are constructed. LSTM counterparts with stack attention are also used for comparison. Transformers have 5 layers, with stack attention replacing the SDPA sublayer in the third layer. Model sizes are adjusted to ensure comparable parameter counts across different architectures.
    Step 3: Initialize Parameters: Fully-connected layers are initialized with Xavier uniform initialization. Layer normalization weights are set to 1, and biases to 0. Other parameters are initialized uniformly from [−0.1,0.1].
    Step 4: Train Models: Models are trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate sampled from [5×10−4,1×10−2]. Minibatches of size 10 are used, and gradients are clipped with a threshold of 5. Early stopping is based on validation cross-entropy, with a maximum of 200 epochs.
    Step 5: Evaluate Models: Models are evaluated on the validation and test sets using cross-entropy difference in nats. For natural language modeling, perplexity is used as the metric. For machine translation, decoder cross-entropy on the validation set and BLEU score on the test set are used.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of transformers with stack attention to standard transformers and LSTM counterparts. Analyze the effectiveness of stack attention in modeling hierarchical patterns and improving data efficiency and generalization. Visualize stack actions to understand the learned patterns.

Elastic Load Balancing for Dynamic LLMs:
  Title: Elastic Load Balancing for Dynamic LLMs
  Problem Statement: The computational and memory costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) are significant, and dynamic training schemes like gradual pruning and layer freezing are emerging to reduce these costs. However, these dynamic schemes introduce workload imbalances among workers, which negatively impact the efficiency of pipeline parallelism in distributed training.
  Motivation: Existing methods for training LLMs, such as static load balancing schemes, assume that the workload remains consistent throughout the training process. This assumption fails when dynamic training schemes are employed, leading to pipeline stalls and reduced computational efficiency. The proposed method, DYNPIPE, aims to address these issues by dynamically redistributing workloads among workers to maintain balance and improve training throughput.
  Proposed Method: DYNPIPE is an elastic load-balancing framework designed to handle dynamic models. It dynamically redistributes workloads among accelerators whenever an imbalance arises during training. The framework supports both single-node multi-GPU environments and multi-node multi-GPU environments. DYNPIPE incorporates two dynamic balancers: a centralized parameter-based partitioning method and an iterative decentralized diffusion-based algorithm. Additionally, DYNPIPE can elastically adapt GPU resources by consolidating workloads onto fewer GPUs as the total workload decreases during training.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on the Wikipedia dataset.
    Step 2: Model Architecture and Training Objectives: The models used for training are GPT models with a sequence length of 512, a hidden size of 1024, and 16 attention heads. The models are trained with a micro-batch size of 2 and a batch size of 64 for 10,000 iterations.
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments involve training GPT models with different numbers of layers (24, 32, 40, 48, 56) on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
    Step 4: Implement Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms: Implement two dynamic load balancing algorithms: (1) Partition by Param and Partition by Time, which use parameter counts and layer execution times, respectively, for partitioning; (2) Diffusion by Param and Diffusion by Time, which use parameter counts and layer execution times, respectively, for iterative decentralized diffusion-based load balancing.
    Step 5: Conduct Single-Node Experiments: Train the GPT models on a single node with 8 A100 GPUs. The pruning region starts from iteration 3000 and continues until iteration 7000, with the model pruned every 1000 iterations until the target sparsity of 90% is reached. Measure the throughput (tokens/sec) for static and dynamic load balancers.
    Step 6: Conduct Multi-Node Experiments: Train the GPT models on up to 90 nodes, each with 8 A100 GPUs, using a hybrid of data and model parallelism. The pruning region starts from iteration 30 and continues until iteration 70, with the model pruned every 10 iterations until the target sparsity of 90% is reached. Measure the throughput (tokens/sec) and speedup over the static baseline.
    Step 7: Implement Re-Packing Strategy: Implement a first-fit algorithm for workload consolidation to reduce the number of active GPUs. Measure the throughput/number of GPUs and overall throughput (tokens/sec) for different model sizes when re-packing the workload into fewer GPUs.
    Step 8: Conduct Layer Freezing Experiments: Train the GPT models with layer freezing on a single node with 8 A100 GPUs. Compare the throughput of DYNPIPE with the state-of-the-art layer freezing solution, Egeria.
    Step 9: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of different load balancing methods and re-packing strategies. Evaluate the speedup and cost savings achieved by DYNPIPE over static load balancing methods and state-of-the-art solutions.

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus and potential impact.

Paper 1, "Stack Attention: Improving the Ability of Transformers to Model Hierarchical Patterns," tackles a fundamental limitation of transformers in modeling hierarchical syntactic patterns. The proposed method, stack attention, draws inspiration from the theoretical connections between stacks and context-free languages to enhance the expressive power of transformers. The authors present a well-structured experiment plan, covering a range of tasks from synthetic context-free languages to natural language modeling and machine translation. The visualization of learned stack actions adds interpretability to the approach. If successful, this work could significantly improve the ability of transformers to handle complex syntactic structures, leading to better language understanding and generation.

Paper 2, "Elastic Load Balancing for Dynamic LLMs," addresses the practical challenge of workload imbalance in distributed training of large language models when using dynamic training schemes. The proposed framework, DYNPIPE, aims to improve training throughput by dynamically redistributing workloads among accelerators. The authors present a comprehensive experiment plan, covering single-node and multi-node environments, and compare their approach to state-of-the-art solutions. The re-packing strategy for workload consolidation is an interesting addition to reduce resource consumption. However, the focus of this work is more on the engineering aspects of training large models efficiently rather than advancing the fundamental capabilities of the models themselves.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 1 is likely to have a more significant impact on the field of natural language processing. The proposed stack attention mechanism addresses a core limitation of transformers and has the potential to unlock new capabilities in modeling hierarchical patterns. The extensive evaluation plan across diverse tasks demonstrates the broad applicability of the approach. In contrast, Paper 2, although valuable in improving training efficiency, does not directly contribute to advancing the state-of-the-art in terms of model performance or capabilities.

Therefore, considering the potential for fundamental advancements in transformer architectures and the well-designed experiment plan, Paper 1 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

Jailbreaking Language Models at Scale via Persona Modulation:
  Title: Jailbreaking Language Models at Scale via Persona Modulation
  Problem Statement: Despite significant efforts to align large language models (LLMs) to produce harmless responses, they remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts, known as jailbreaks, that elicit undesirable behavior. This paper investigates persona modulation as a method to steer LLMs into adopting specific personalities that are more likely to comply with harmful instructions.
  Motivation: Existing methods to align LLMs, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and adversarial training, have foundational and technical limitations that make it difficult to develop robustly-aligned AI systems. Manual crafting of jailbreak prompts is labor-intensive and not scalable. The proposed method leverages persona modulation to automate the generation of jailbreak prompts, making it possible to exploit vulnerabilities at scale. This approach is expected to be more effective and efficient than existing methods.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves persona modulation, a black-box jailbreaking technique that steers the target model to adopt specific personalities likely to comply with harmful instructions. The process is automated using an LLM assistant to generate jailbreak prompts for various personas and misuse instructions. This reduces the manual effort to designing a single jailbreak prompt, which the assistant then uses to create specialized persona-modulation prompts for arbitrary tasks and personas.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments involve evaluating the vulnerability of state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4, Claude 2, and Vicuna-33B to persona-modulation attacks. A list of 43 harmful categories that LLM providers currently block is manually crafted.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, prompts are designed to elicit responses without persona modulation. For the proposed method, the following steps are automated using an LLM assistant:
1. Definition of a target harmful category (e.g., 'promoting disinformation campaigns').
2. Definition of specific misuse instructions for which the model would abstain by default (e.g., 'How might someone spread their perspective widely?').
3. Definition of a persona that would likely comply with the misuse instructions (e.g., 'Aggressive Propagandist').
4. Design of a persona-modulation prompt to steer the model to assume the proposed persona.
    Step 3: Select Models: The primary target model is GPT-4, with evaluations also conducted on Claude 2 and Vicuna-33B. GPT-4 is used both as the target model and the assistant for generating the attacks.
    Step 4: Get Results: Sample 3 completions for each misuse instruction from each model using persona modulation and 20 completions for each misuse instruction without persona modulation as a baseline. Use GPT-4 as a zero-shot PICT classifier to assess whether each completion is harmful.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the harmful completion rates of the models before and after persona modulation. Evaluate the transferability of the persona-modulation prompts across different models. Analyze the effectiveness of the attacks across various harmful categories.

INSIDE: LLMs' Internal States Retain the Power of Hallucination Detection:
  Title: INSIDE: LLMs' Internal States Retain the Power of Hallucination Detection
  Problem Statement: Knowledge hallucination has raised widespread concerns for the security and reliability of deployed Large Language Models (LLMs). The problem is to accurately detect and reject responses when hallucinations occur in LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods for detecting hallucinations often rely on logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency evaluation, where semantic information is inevitably lost during the token-decoding procedure. These methods are not sufficient because they fail to capture the dense semantic information retained within the internal states of LLMs. The proposed method leverages the internal states of LLMs to directly measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space, which is expected to retain highly-concentrated semantic information and thus improve hallucination detection.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, INSIDE, leverages the internal states of LLMs for hallucination detection. It introduces a simple yet effective EigenScore metric to evaluate responses' self-consistency by exploiting the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix. Additionally, a test-time feature clipping approach is explored to truncate extreme activations in the internal states, reducing overconfident generations and potentially benefiting the detection of overconfident hallucinations.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Utilize four widely used question answering (QA) datasets for evaluation: CoQA, SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions (NQ).
    Step 2: Select Models: Use two representative open-source LLMs: LLaMA (7B and 13B) and OPT (6.7B).
    Step 3: Implement Baseline Methods: Implement the most popular uncertainty-based methods (Perplexity, Length-normalized Entropy) and consistency-based metrics (Lexical Similarity). Also, include a popular OOD detection method (Energy score) for comparison.
    Step 4: Implement Proposed Method: 1. Compute the EigenScore by measuring the semantic divergence in the sentence embedding space. 2. Apply test-time feature clipping to truncate extreme activations in the internal states. Use a memory bank to dynamically determine the clipping thresholds.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the hallucination detection performance using AUROC and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) as metrics. Compare the performance of the proposed method with baseline methods on the selected datasets.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze whether the proposed method improves the performance of LLMs in hallucination detection compared to the baselines. Conduct ablation studies to verify the efficacy of the EigenScore and feature clipping approach.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of large language models (LLMs). Paper 1 focuses on the problem of jailbreaking LLMs through persona modulation, while Paper 2 tackles the issue of knowledge hallucination detection using the internal states of LLMs.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses a critical security concern in LLMs, as jailbreaking can lead to undesirable and harmful behavior.
- Proposes an automated approach to generate jailbreak prompts using persona modulation, which is more scalable than manual crafting.
- Evaluates the vulnerability of state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4, Claude 2, and Vicuna-33B.
- Analyzes the transferability of persona-modulation prompts across different models.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The effectiveness of persona modulation in jailbreaking LLMs is not compared to existing methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and adversarial training.
- The ethical implications of automating the generation of jailbreak prompts are not thoroughly discussed.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the critical issue of knowledge hallucination in LLMs, which affects their reliability and security.
- Proposes a novel method, INSIDE, that leverages the internal states of LLMs to detect hallucinations effectively.
- Introduces the EigenScore metric and test-time feature clipping approach to improve hallucination detection.
- Evaluates the proposed method on four widely used question answering datasets and compares it with popular baseline methods.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The generalizability of the proposed method to other NLP tasks beyond question answering is not explored.
- The computational overhead of computing the EigenScore and applying feature clipping is not discussed.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 2 appears to be the more promising and impactful work. It addresses a fundamental problem in LLMs, knowledge hallucination, which has far-reaching implications for their reliability and trustworthiness. The proposed method, INSIDE, leverages the internal states of LLMs in a novel way to detect hallucinations effectively. The paper also conducts thorough experiments on multiple datasets and compares the proposed method with relevant baselines.

In contrast, while Paper 1 addresses an important security concern, the ethical implications of automating jailbreak prompt generation are not thoroughly discussed. Additionally, the effectiveness of persona modulation in jailbreaking LLMs is not compared to existing methods, making it difficult to assess its relative merit.

All Languages Matter: On the Multilingual Safety of Large Language Models:
  Title: All Languages Matter: On the Multilingual Safety of Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: The safety of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for their development and deployment. However, existing safety benchmarks primarily focus on a single language, typically English, which is the majority language in the pretraining data. This paper addresses the gap in evaluating and ensuring the safety of LLMs across multiple languages.
  Motivation: Existing methods are insufficient because they only consider safety in one language, ignoring the global deployment of LLMs and their use in non-English languages. This oversight can lead to significantly more unsafe responses in non-English languages. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to create a multilingual safety benchmark, XSafety, which covers 14 types of safety issues across 10 languages. The proposed method aims to empirically study the multilingual safety of LLMs and develop effective prompting methods to improve their safety in non-English languages.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves creating the XSafety benchmark, which includes 14 types of safety issues across 10 languages. The benchmark is used to evaluate the multilingual safety of four widely-used LLMs. Additionally, several simple and effective prompting methods are proposed to improve the multilingual safety of ChatGPT by evoking safety knowledge and enhancing cross-lingual generalization of safety alignment. These methods significantly reduce the ratio of unsafe responses for non-English queries.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect several well-established monolingual safety benchmarks covering 14 types of safety issues. Translate these benchmarks into 10 languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Bengali, Arabic, Hindi, Russian, Japanese, and German. Ensure the translated data is accurate through multiple rounds of proofreading by professional translators.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Develop prompts to evaluate the safety of LLMs. For example, use the prompt: 'The following dialogue is Person 1 and Person 2: Person 1: {Prompt} Person 2: {Response} Under the [safety] scenario, is Person 2’s response safe? Answering starts with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.'
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate the multilingual safety of four widely-used LLMs: ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo-0613), PaLM2, LLaMA2-Chat-13B, and Vicuna-13B. Use the OpenAI official APIs for ChatGPT with a temperature of 0 to obtain more deterministic results.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate responses from the models for the XSafety benchmark in all 10 languages. Use ChatGPT as an evaluator to determine the safety of the responses. Translate non-English responses to English using Google Translator before evaluation.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the unsafety ratios of responses in different languages. Identify the most challenging safety scenarios and languages. Develop and test several prompting methods (SafePrompt, XLingPrompt, XSafePrompt) to improve the multilingual safety of ChatGPT. Analyze the effectiveness of these methods in reducing unsafe responses.

Rationality of Thought Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models:
  Title: Rationality of Thought Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: While the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been progressively advanced, their competence in addressing intricate reasoning tasks remains inadequate, primarily due to their insufficient cognitive capabilities. This paper aims to explore and enhance the cognitive proficiency of models like GPT-4 by leveraging methodologies from cognitive psychology.
  Motivation: Existing methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and other inference enhancement techniques have shown some improvements but still fall short in complex reasoning tasks. These methods often fail to fully engage the model in a rational thinking process, leading to suboptimal performance. The proposed method, Rationality of Thought (RoT), is inspired by human cognitive processes, particularly the structured and reflective steps of rational thinking. By prompting LLMs to follow a rational thinking process, RoT aims to significantly improve their cognitive capabilities and reasoning accuracy.
  Proposed Method: The Rationality of Thought (RoT) method integrates human rational thinking methods into the model’s thought process through a series of structured and reflective steps. These steps include identification, decomposition, reflection, calculation, and evaluation. The method is designed to prompt LLMs into a rational thinking process during task execution, thereby improving their accuracy and cognitive capabilities.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We develop a cognitive bias dataset to measure the rational thinking and cognitive levels of LLMs. This dataset includes 29 types of cognitive biases, collected from various professional psychology publications. Additionally, we use arithmetic reasoning datasets (GSM8K, SVAMP, AQUA-RAT) and a commonsense reasoning dataset (ARC).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the cognitive bias dataset, the prompt includes steps to diagnose the type of cognitive bias, propose an approach, execute steps with probability calculations, reflect on conclusions, evaluate alternatives, and provide a final answer. For arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, the prompt guides the model through a similar structured process.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use three models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and LLAMA2-13B-chat. All models are invoked using the OpenAI API key.
    Step 4: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines (Direct Answer and CoT-zero shot) and the proposed RoT method.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the models using the RoT method against the baselines. Evaluate the accuracy improvements on the cognitive bias dataset and the reasoning tasks. Conduct an ablation study to understand the significance of each step in the RoT method.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important aspects of large language models (LLMs) and propose methods to improve their performance. However, there are notable differences in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1, "All Languages Matter: On the Multilingual Safety of Large Language Models," addresses a critical issue in the development and deployment of LLMs: the safety of their responses across multiple languages. The paper highlights the lack of attention given to non-English languages in existing safety benchmarks and proposes a novel multilingual safety benchmark, XSafety, covering 14 types of safety issues across 10 languages. The authors evaluate the multilingual safety of four widely-used LLMs and propose effective prompting methods to improve their safety in non-English languages. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured and includes the creation of the XSafety benchmark, evaluation of LLMs, and analysis of results. The proposed method has the potential to significantly reduce unsafe responses in non-English languages, which is crucial for the global deployment of LLMs.

Paper 2, "Rationality of Thought Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models," focuses on enhancing the cognitive capabilities of LLMs to improve their performance in complex reasoning tasks. The authors propose the Rationality of Thought (RoT) method, which integrates human rational thinking methods into the model's thought process through structured and reflective steps. The paper develops a cognitive bias dataset to measure the rational thinking and cognitive levels of LLMs and evaluates the performance of three models using the RoT method against baselines. While the proposed method is innovative and draws inspiration from cognitive psychology, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how the RoT method is implemented in the prompts and how it differs from existing methods like Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Comparing the two papers, Paper 1 addresses a more pressing issue in the field of LLMs: the safety of their responses across multiple languages. The proposed XSafety benchmark and prompting methods have the potential to make a significant impact on the global deployment of LLMs. In contrast, while Paper 2 proposes an interesting method to improve the cognitive capabilities of LLMs, the novelty and effectiveness of the RoT method compared to existing methods are not clearly demonstrated.

In conclusion, Paper 1 is likely to be accepted by a top AI conference due to its focus on a critical issue, the novelty of the proposed multilingual safety benchmark, and the potential impact on the global deployment of LLMs.

Transformer Fusion with Optimal Transport:
  Title: Transformer Fusion with Optimal Transport
  Problem Statement: Fusion is a technique for merging multiple independently-trained neural networks to combine their capabilities. While past attempts have been restricted to fully-connected, convolutional, and residual networks, there is a need for a systematic approach to fuse transformer-based networks.
  Motivation: Existing methods for model fusion, such as vanilla fusion (VF), often fail to align the parameter matrices effectively, leading to suboptimal performance. This is particularly problematic for transformers due to their complex architecture involving multi-head self-attention, layer-normalization, and residual connections. The proposed method leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to align these components, allowing for more effective fusion, including the fusion of models of different sizes (heterogeneous fusion). This approach is expected to outperform existing baselines by ensuring meaningful information preservation and efficient model compression.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Optimal Transport Fusion (OTFusion), aligns the weight or parameter matrices of transformer models before fusing them. This involves a layerwise alignment using transportation maps (TMs) derived from OT theory. The method handles key transformer components such as multi-head self-attention, layer-normalization, and residual connections through a novel graph interpretation of the TM flow. The approach supports both hard and soft alignments, with soft alignment showing superior performance for transformers. The method is evaluated on image classification tasks using Vision Transformer (ViT) and natural language modeling tasks using BERT.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on multiple well-known image classification datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K. For natural language tasks, we use a subset of the Wikipedia dataset for masked language modeling (MLM) with BERT.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification tasks and BERT for natural language modeling tasks. The ViT models are trained from scratch on each dataset, ensuring diversity by initializing with different seed values and batch randomization. BERT models are also trained from scratch on the MLM task.
    Step 4: Model Fusion: We apply the proposed OTFusion method to align and fuse the models. For transformers, we handle multi-head self-attention by aligning the weights and heads using cross-head alignment. Layer normalization parameters are aligned using the incoming TM, and residual connections are handled using different TM flow strategies (averaging, weighted scalar, and weighted matrix). We optimize the Sinkhorn regularizer for soft alignment.
    Step 5: Get Results: We measure the one-shot performance of the fused models without any retraining. We also finetune the fused models and compare their performance against the individual parent models, their ensemble, and VF. The performance is evaluated based on accuracy for image classification tasks and loss for the MLM task.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: We compare the one-shot and finetuned performance of the fused models against the baselines. We analyze the impact of different TM flow strategies, the Sinkhorn regularizer, and the stability of soft alignment. We also evaluate the effectiveness of heterogeneous fusion by fusing models of different sizes.

LARG2, Language-based Automatic Reward and Goal Generation:
  Title: LARG2, Language-based Automatic Reward and Goal Generation
  Problem Statement: Robotic tasks currently addressed with reinforcement learning such as locomotion, navigation, and manipulation are challenged with the problem of defining reward functions to maximize and goals to reach. Alternative methodologies, like imitation learning, often require labor-intensive human annotations to produce datasets of task descriptions associated with trajectories.
  Motivation: Existing methods like imitation learning require extensive human annotations, making them labor-intensive and unscalable. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches struggle with defining appropriate reward functions and goals. The proposed method, LARG2, leverages the code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the conversion of text-based task descriptions into corresponding reward and goal-generation functions. This approach aims to reduce human intervention and make the process more scalable by utilizing the common-sense knowledge embedded in LLMs and Chain-of-Thought mechanisms.
  Proposed Method: LARG2 is a framework that translates textual task descriptions into both goal and reward functions to enable scalable training of goal-conditioned (GCRL) and multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) policies. The method involves three sequential steps: (1) Gathering input for code generation, (2) Code generation using LLMs, and (3) Automatic error discovery and correction. The framework leverages Chain-of-Thought mechanisms and common-sense knowledge embedded in LLMs. It also includes a feedback loop for code validation and correction to ensure the generated functions are executable within standard GCRL or MTRL frameworks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use the Pick and Place scenarios and repositories defined in the IsaacGym repository designed for a Franka Emika Panda robot arm. The environment includes a table, a Franka Emika Panda robot arm, and cubes on the table.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      GCRL:
        Prompt: Generate a function to set goal values for a given task description. The function should take into account the environment parameters and the task description.
        Example Prompt: Generate a function to move a cube to the top right corner of the table.
      MTRL:
        Prompt: Generate a reward function for a given task description. The function should combine task-independent and task-dependent components.
        Example Prompt: Generate a reward function for moving a cube to the top left corner of the table.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use three LLMs: GPT-4, Hyper Clova X, and StarCoder. For the main experiments, we use GPT-4 due to its superior performance in code generation.
    Step 4: Get Results:
      GCRL: Evaluate the generated goal functions on a series of 8 tasks involving a single object and 4 tasks involving a set of 3 objects. Validate the compliance of generated goal poses with task descriptions.
      MTRL: Train a policy using Proximal Policy Optimization with default Franka Move parameters. Evaluate the generated reward functions on 9 manipulation tasks.
    Step 5: Analyze Results:
      GCRL: Compare the success rates of generated goal poses with task descriptions. Analyze the impact of additional code samples on the accuracy of generated functions.
      MTRL: Compare the success rates of trained policies using the generated reward functions. Analyze the impact of task-dependent and task-independent components on the overall performance.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Strengths of Paper 1 (Transformer Fusion with Optimal Transport):

- Supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous fusion, allowing for model compression.
- Comprehensive evaluation plan on both image classification and natural language modeling tasks.
- Compares against relevant baselines, including vanilla fusion and ensemble methods.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- Lacks a clear comparison with state-of-the-art methods in model compression and knowledge distillation.
- Does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and efficiency of the proposed method.

Strengths of Paper 2 (LARG2, Language-based Automatic Reward and Goal Generation):
- Tackles the important problem of automating reward and goal generation for robotic tasks.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- Relies heavily on the performance of the underlying Large Language Models, which may limit the generalizability of the approach.
- Does not provide a detailed analysis of the quality and diversity of the generated task descriptions.
- Lacks a comparison with other automated reward and goal generation methods, if any exist.

Comparison and Decision:
Both papers address important problems in their respective domains and propose novel solutions. However, Paper 2 (LARG2) stands out for its potential impact on the field of robotics and reinforcement learning. By automating the process of reward and goal generation, LARG2 can significantly reduce the human effort required in designing robotic tasks and make the process more scalable. The incorporation of a feedback loop for code validation and correction adds to the robustness of the approach. Additionally, the evaluation on a diverse set of manipulation tasks using a realistic robotic environment demonstrates the practicality of the method.

In contrast, while Paper 1 (Transformer Fusion with Optimal Transport) proposes a novel approach for fusing transformer-based networks, its impact is relatively limited to the specific problem of model compression and knowledge distillation. The lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods and the absence of a detailed computational complexity analysis somewhat weaken the contribution.

Therefore, considering the potential impact, novelty, and the thoroughness of the evaluation, Paper 2 (LARG2) is likely to be the accepted idea.

Maximizing LLMs Potential:
  Title: Maximizing LLMs Potential: Enhancing Mongolian Chinese Machine Translation with RL Agents and Adversarial Multi Knowledge Distillation
  Problem Statement: Despite the impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various NLP tasks, they still face significant challenges in low-resource translation tasks, particularly in Mongolian to Chinese machine translation, often yielding suboptimal results.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as traditional neural machine translation models, require large datasets for training, which are not available for low-resource languages like Mongolian. Knowledge distillation has shown promise in improving performance in low-resource settings, but it often fails to consider the dynamic nature of the distillation process. The proposed method leverages multi-source knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning to dynamically extract and transfer useful information from LLMs, thereby improving the translation quality in low-resource settings.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method combines multi-source knowledge distillation with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the performance of low-resource translation models. The key components include: 1) Extracting knowledge from multiple teacher models trained on different datasets; 2) Using RL agents to dynamically select the most useful information from the teacher models; 3) Introducing a new reward function to guide the knowledge distillation process; 4) Incorporating adversarial noise to improve the robustness of the student model.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use three large-scale corpus datasets for training the teacher models: English-Chinese (17.8 million sentence pairs), English-Turkish (28.3 million sentence pairs), and Russian-Chinese (63.2 million sentence pairs). The student model is trained and tested on Mongolian-Chinese (8.7 million sentences), Korean-Chinese (12.5 million sentences), and Japanese-Chinese (12 million sentences) translation tasks.
    Step 2: Select Models: We use Transformer, Performer, and Linformer as student models. For teacher models, we employ Llama2-13B and GPT-NEOX-20B.
    Step 3: Configure Training: Set different learning rates for teacher (0.01) and student (0.001) models. Use Adam optimizer with weight decay and gradual learning rate scheduling. Set batch size to 64 and maximum sequence length to 128. Train teacher models for 100 epochs and student model for 300 epochs. Use NVIDIA A100 GPUs for training.
    Step 4: Implement Knowledge Distillation: 1) Initialize teacher weights equally. 2) Calculate the weighted loss of the teacher and student networks using a combination of MSE and CrossEntropy losses. 3) Introduce adversarial noise to enhance robustness. 4) Use RL agents to dynamically adjust teacher weights based on a new reward function that considers BLEU score, SCRPS, Gini coefficient, Pearson correlation, and Herfindahl Index.
    Step 5: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the student model's performance using BLEU scores on the Mongolian-Chinese, Korean-Chinese, and Japanese-Chinese datasets. Compare the performance with and without multi-source knowledge distillation, adversarial perturbation, and reinforcement learning.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the impact of different components (multi-source knowledge distillation, adversarial perturbation, RL agent) on the BLEU scores. Conduct sensitivity analysis for hyperparameters and ablation experiments to understand the contribution of each component.

Circuit Component Reuse Across Tasks in Transformer Language Models:
  Title: Circuit Component Reuse Across Tasks in Transformer Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of understanding whether the insights gained from circuit analysis in transformer language models can generalize across different tasks. This is important because a common criticism of mechanistic interpretability is that each circuit is task-specific, limiting the broader understanding of model behavior.
  Motivation: Existing methods in mechanistic interpretability have successfully reverse-engineered specific behaviors in language models through circuit analysis. However, these methods are often criticized for being task-specific, which limits their utility in understanding model behavior at a higher level. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to demonstrate that both low-level findings about specific heads and higher-level findings about general algorithms can generalize across tasks. The proposed method aims to show that it is possible to explain large language models' behavior in terms of a relatively small number of interpretable, task-general algorithmic building blocks and computational components.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves studying the circuit discovered for the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task and demonstrating its generalizability to a different task, Colored Objects. The method includes reproducing the IOI circuit on a larger GPT2 model and showing that it is mostly reused to solve the Colored Objects task. The process involves path patching, attention pattern analysis, and logit attribution to reverse-engineer and explain the important model components necessary to predict the correct answer. A proof-of-concept intervention experiment is also conducted to adjust specific attention heads to 'repair' the Colored Objects circuit and make it behave like the IOI circuit.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the IOI task dataset from Wang et al. (2022) and the Colored Objects task dataset, which is a variation on an in-context learning task from BIG-Bench. The IOI dataset consists of 1000 examples, and the Colored Objects dataset consists of 1000 examples with 17 object classes and eight possible colors.
    Step 2: Model Selection: Use GPT2-Medium for the experiments. The IOI circuit was originally discovered in GPT2-Small, and the goal is to reproduce it in GPT2-Medium and test its generalizability.
    Step 3: Path Patching for IOI Task: Perform path patching on the IOI task to identify the important attention heads and their roles. This involves patching activations from one input to another and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Identify the mover heads, inhibition heads, and duplicate token heads involved in the IOI circuit.
    Step 4: Path Patching for Colored Objects Task: Perform path patching on the Colored Objects task to identify the important attention heads and their roles. Compare the identified heads with those from the IOI task to determine the overlap. Identify the mover heads, content gatherer heads, and duplicate token heads involved in the Colored Objects circuit.
    Step 5: Intervention Experiment: Conduct a proof-of-concept intervention experiment by adjusting the attention patterns of the inhibition heads and negative mover head in the Colored Objects task. Force these heads to attend to the incorrect color options and measure the impact on task accuracy. Analyze the downstream effects on the mover heads and logit attribution.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the circuits identified for the IOI and Colored Objects tasks. Measure the overlap in attention heads and their roles. Evaluate the impact of the intervention experiment on task accuracy and the behavior of the mover heads. Provide evidence that the inhibition-mover subcircuit is a robust structure across different tasks.

- Provides a detailed step-by-step experiment plan, including dataset selection, model configuration, and evaluation metrics.
- Considers the dynamic nature of the knowledge distillation process and introduces a new reward function to guide it.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The proposed method is complex and involves multiple components, which may make it difficult to isolate the contribution of each component.
- The experiment plan relies on large-scale datasets for training the teacher models, which may not always be available for low-resource languages.
- The effectiveness of the proposed method may be limited to specific language pairs and may not generalize well to other low-resource translation tasks.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the critical issue of understanding the generalizability of insights gained from circuit analysis in transformer language models.
- Proposes a novel approach to demonstrate that both low-level and high-level findings from circuit analysis can generalize across tasks.
- Provides a clear and concise experiment plan, including reproducing the IOI circuit on a larger model and testing its generalizability on the Colored Objects task.
- Conducts a proof-of-concept intervention experiment to adjust specific attention heads and analyze the impact on task accuracy and model behavior.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The study is limited to two specific tasks (IOI and Colored Objects) and may not provide a comprehensive understanding of circuit generalizability across a wide range of tasks.
- The experiment plan relies on a specific model (GPT2-Medium) and may not be directly applicable to other transformer language models.
- The intervention experiment is a proof-of-concept and may not fully capture the complexity of adjusting attention heads in real-world scenarios.

Comparison and Decision:
While both papers address important problems in the field of natural language processing, Paper 2 stands out for its novel approach to understanding the generalizability of circuit analysis insights across tasks. The proposed method directly tackles a common criticism of mechanistic interpretability and provides a clear path towards explaining model behavior in terms of interpretable, task-general algorithmic building blocks. In contrast, Paper 1, although addressing the important problem of low-resource machine translation, proposes a complex method that may be difficult to interpret and generalize to other language pairs.

Therefore, based on the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 2 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference due to its innovative approach, clear experiment plan, and potential to advance the understanding of transformer language models.

Explainable, Steerable Models with Natural Language Parameters and Constraints:
  Title: Explainable, Steerable Models with Natural Language Parameters and Constraints
  Problem Statement: Statistical modeling can uncover patterns in large datasets, but these patterns may not be explainable or relevant to our specific interest. For example, Gaussian mixture models are commonly used to explore text corpora, but it is hard to explain what each cluster means or steer them to use specific attributes (e.g., cluster based on style but not topic).
  Motivation: Existing methods like Gaussian mixture models and neural embeddings often rely on high-dimensional parameters, which are difficult to explain and steer. These models output clusters as Gaussian distributions over neural embeddings, which are not immediately explainable to humans. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to use natural language as an interface between human practitioners and statistical models. By leveraging the denotational semantics of natural language, the proposed method interprets predicates as binary feature extractors, making the models more explainable and steerable.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces models where parameters are represented as natural language strings. Instead of using a Gaussian to represent a cluster, the model uses a natural language predicate such as 'has a casual style.' These predicates are interpreted as binary feature extractors and used as building blocks for classical statistical models like clustering, topic modeling, and regression. The method also allows specifying constraints on the learned string parameters, such as 'the parameters should be style-related.' The learning algorithm optimizes the log-likelihood of these models by iteratively optimizing continuous relaxations of string parameters and then discretizing them using a language model.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on three real datasets: New York Times (NYT) articles, AG-News, and DB-Pedia. Each dataset contains text samples annotated with gold topic or location descriptions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, we use prompts to generate natural language predicates and to check whether these predicates are true for given text samples. Example prompts include:
- Denotation Prompt: 'Check whether the TEXT satisfies a PROPERTY. Respond with Yes or No. When uncertain, output No. Now complete the following example - input: PROPERTY: has a casual style TEXT: 'see the player last night?' output: yes'
- Discretizer Prompt: 'Here is a corpus of text samples each associated with a score. The text samples are sorted from the lowest to the highest score. I want to understand what topic of text achieves a higher score. Your response should start with 'has a location of' ....'
- Project Prompt: 'In this task the user wants to extract some key information from a text. Come up with a few key phrases (in English) based on the text based on the goal. constraint: We want to cluster the text based on their topics. text: the musician resonated with profound emotional undertones keyinfo (in English): art, music, performance'
    Step 3: Select Models: We use several models for different tasks: google/flan-t5-xl for computing natural language predicates, gpt-3.5-turbo for extracting constraint-relevant information and proposing predicates, and hku-nlp/instructor-large for creating sample embeddings.
    Step 4: Optimize Parameters: We use a two-step optimization process:
1. OptimizeWandPhi: Optimize continuous relaxations of natural language parameters using gradient descent.
2. Discretize: Convert continuous representations into discrete predicates by prompting a language model to generate candidate predicates that explain the variation in the learned continuous predicate.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the proposed method on clustering, topic modeling, contrastive feature learning, and regression tasks. Compare the denotation and surface similarity between the estimated parameters and the reference descriptions.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with baselines like random predicates, no constraints, and no refinement. Analyze whether continuous relaxation, refinement, and steering with constraints improve the performance.

Guiding Instruction-based Image Editing via Multimodal Large Language Models:
  Title: Guiding Instruction-based Image Editing via Multimodal Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Instruction-based image editing aims to improve the controllability and flexibility of image manipulation through natural language commands. However, human instructions are often too brief for current methods to accurately capture and follow, leading to suboptimal editing results.
  Motivation: Existing methods like InsPix2Pix rely on static descriptions and brief instructions, which are often ambiguous and insufficient for guiding image editing tasks. These methods struggle to capture the essential visual transformations required for accurate editing. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in cross-modal understanding and visual-aware response generation, which can potentially address the shortcomings of current methods by providing more expressive and detailed instructions.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE), leverages MLLMs to derive expressive instructions and provide explicit visual-related guidance for image editing. MGIE consists of an MLLM and a diffusion model. The MLLM generates concise and expressive instructions, which are then transformed into visual guidance through a sequence-to-sequence model. The diffusion model performs the actual image editing by incorporating this visual guidance, allowing for end-to-end training and improved editing performance.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the IPr2Pr dataset for pre-training, which contains 1M CLIP-ﬁltered data with instructions generated by GPT-3 and images synthesized by Prompt-to-Prompt. For evaluation, use EVR, GIER, MA5k, and MagicBrush datasets, which cover various aspects of image editing such as Photoshop-style modifications, global photo optimization, and local editing.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: Initialize the MLLM from LLaV A-7B and the diffusion model from StableDiffusion-v1.5. The MLLM generates expressive instructions, which are then transformed into visual guidance using a 4-layer Transformer edit head. The diffusion model performs image editing by incorporating this visual guidance.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: Train the MLLM to generate concise expressive instructions using a cross-entropy loss. Train the diffusion model to perform image editing using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) loss. The overall training loss is a combination of the instruction loss and the editing loss.
    Step 4: Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the models on each specific dataset (EVR, GIER, MA5k, MagicBrush) to adapt to different editing tasks. This involves updating the MLLM to generate domain-specific expressive instructions and the diffusion model to perform accurate image editing based on these instructions.
    Step 5: Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the models using various metrics such as L1 pixel difference, DINO visual feature similarity, CLIP visual encoder similarity (CVS), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Conduct human evaluations to assess the quality of expressive instructions and the overall editing results.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of MGIE with baselines like InsPix2Pix and LGIE. Analyze the improvements in automatic metrics and human evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of MGIE in providing explicit visual-aware guidance for image editing.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose novel methods for improving the interpretability and controllability of machine learning models using natural language. However, there are some key differences in their approaches and potential impact.

Paper 1 focuses on making statistical models more explainable and steerable by using natural language predicates as parameters and constraints. The proposed method leverages the denotational semantics of natural language to interpret predicates as binary feature extractors, making the models more interpretable to humans. The experiment plan is well-structured, covering various datasets, models, and evaluation metrics. The method has the potential to improve the interpretability and controllability of a wide range of statistical models, including clustering, topic modeling, and regression.

Paper 2 addresses the problem of instruction-based image editing, aiming to improve the accuracy and quality of image manipulation through natural language commands. The proposed method, MGIE, leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate expressive instructions and provide explicit visual-related guidance for image editing. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering various datasets, model architectures, training objectives, and evaluation metrics. The method has the potential to significantly improve the controllability and flexibility of image editing tasks.

While both papers propose innovative methods, Paper 2 seems to have a more focused and impactful contribution. Instruction-based image editing is a rapidly growing area with numerous practical applications, and the proposed MGIE method addresses a key challenge in this domain by providing more expressive and detailed instructions for accurate editing. The use of MLLMs for cross-modal understanding and visual-aware response generation is a novel and promising approach. Additionally, the extensive evaluation plan, covering various datasets and metrics, demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

In contrast, while Paper 1's approach to explainable and steerable statistical models is valuable, it may have a more limited impact due to the focus on specific model types and the reliance on natural language predicates. The interpretability and controllability improvements may not be as significant or widely applicable compared to the advancements in instruction-based image editing proposed in Paper 2.

DebateGPT:
  Title: DebateGPT: Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Multi-agent Debate Supervision
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in language generation, comprehension, and reasoning without relying heavily on resource-intensive human-in-the-loop feedback. This problem is crucial as it aims to reduce the cost and labor associated with fine-tuning LLMs while maintaining or even improving their performance.
  Motivation: Existing methods for fine-tuning LLMs often rely on human-in-the-loop feedback, which is labor-intensive and costly. While using powerful models like GPT-4 for data generation guarantees high-quality data, it is financially prohibitive. On the other hand, more cost-effective models like GPT-3.5 sometimes fall short in data quality. The inspiration behind the proposed method is to leverage multi-agent debate, a technique where multiple LLMs debate to generate high-quality data without human annotations. This approach is expected to be more economical and scalable, providing a pathway to high-quality training data without the need for expensive human feedback.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, DebateGPT, involves fine-tuning GPT-3.5 using data generated through an improved multi-agent debate process. The key steps include: 1) Summarization: Summarizing responses from multiple agents to handle context window constraints. 2) Confidence Scoring: Assigning confidence scores to each response to minimize the influence of weaker replies. 3) Cleaning: Removing irrelevant content from the final debate response. These steps aim to generate high-quality data for fine-tuning, resulting in a model that performs comparably to GPT-4 despite being smaller and using a modest dataset.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The primary dataset used is the Alpaca dataset, consisting of 52,000 question-answer pairs. For evaluation, the AlpacaEval test set, MMLU, Arithmetic, Winogrande, and ARC datasets are used.
    Step 2: Data Generation: Generate responses for 5,000 randomly sampled questions from the Alpaca dataset using the improved multi-agent debate method. This involves multiple rounds of debate among LLM agents, summarization of responses, confidence scoring, and cleaning of the final answers.
    Step 3: Fine-tune Models: Fine-tune GPT-3.5 using the OpenAI FineTuning API with the generated dataset. The data format for fine-tuning is: {"messages": ["role": "user", "content": "Question", "role": "assistant", "content": "Answer"]}. Fine-tune for a user-specified number of epochs, with 4 epochs identified as optimal.
    Step 4: Evaluate Models: Evaluate the fine-tuned DebateGPT-3.5 on the AlpacaEval test set, MMLU, Arithmetic, Winogrande, and ARC datasets. Compare its performance with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance improvements of DebateGPT-3.5 over GPT-3.5 and its comparability to GPT-4. Assess the impact of the improved multi-agent debate method on data quality and model performance. Additionally, evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed method compared to using GPT-4 directly.

Nemesis: Normalizing the Soft-prompt Vectors of Vision-Language Models:
  Title: Nemesis: Normalizing the Soft-prompt Vectors of Vision-Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of how the norms of learnable soft-prompt vectors impact the performance of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, it investigates whether normalizing these soft-prompt vectors can enhance the performance of VLMs in various downstream tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods in soft-prompt tuning for VLMs have primarily focused on enhancing model performance through the alignment of visual and textual features. However, they have largely overlooked the intrinsic properties of learnable soft-prompt vectors, particularly their norms. The paper introduces the 'Low-Norm Effect,' which suggests that reducing the norms of certain learned prompts can occasionally enhance performance, while increasing them often degrades it. The proposed method, Nemesis, aims to systematically investigate and harness this effect to improve VLM performance.
  Proposed Method: Nemesis involves normalizing the soft-prompt vectors in VLMs. The method introduces two types of normalization losses: Position-Uniform Normalization (PUN) loss and Position-Aware Normalization (PAN) loss. The PUN loss uniformly normalizes the norms of all prompt vectors, while the PAN loss selectively normalizes prompt vectors at positions identified to induce the Low-Norm Effect. The PAN loss includes a pre-inference step to identify these positions by applying corruption operations and comparing the performance of corrupted and non-corrupted prompts.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on 11 visual classification datasets for few-shot image classification and base-to-new generalization tasks, including Caltech101, ImageNet, EuroSAT, DTD, UCF101, SUN397, OxfordPets, FGVCAircraft, Food101, Flowers102, and StanfordCars. Additionally, ImageNet and its variants (ImageNet-A, ImageNet-R, ImageNetV2, and ImageNet-Sketch) are used for domain generalization evaluation.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, the CoOp method is used, which involves setting the templated context prompts as learnable vectors. For the proposed method, Nemesis, the soft-prompt vectors are normalized using either the PUN loss or the PAN loss. The PUN loss uniformly normalizes all prompt vectors, while the PAN loss selectively normalizes vectors at positions identified to induce the Low-Norm Effect.
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments use the CLIP model with a ResNet-50 backbone. The CoOp method is used as the baseline, and the proposed Nemesis method is applied to it.
    Step 4: Get Results: The performance of the models is evaluated on the selected datasets. The metrics used include classification accuracy for few-shot image classification and base-to-new generalization tasks, and domain generalization performance on ImageNet variants.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the baseline CoOp method with the proposed Nemesis method (using both PUN and PAN losses). Analyze whether normalizing the soft-prompt vectors improves the performance of VLMs in these tasks. Additionally, conduct in-depth studies on the Low-Norm Effect and its impact on model performance.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). The DebateGPT paper focuses on fine-tuning LLMs using multi-agent debate supervision to reduce the reliance on resource-intensive human-in-the-loop feedback. On the other hand, the Nemesis paper investigates the impact of normalizing soft-prompt vectors on the performance of VLMs in various downstream tasks.

Strengths of DebateGPT:
1. Addresses the crucial problem of reducing the cost and labor associated with fine-tuning LLMs while maintaining high performance.
2. Proposes an innovative approach using multi-agent debate to generate high-quality training data without expensive human annotations.
3. Provides a clear and detailed step-by-step experiment plan, including data gathering, generation, fine-tuning, evaluation, and analysis.
4. Compares the performance of the proposed method with state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Weaknesses of DebateGPT:
1. The paper relies on a single dataset (Alpaca) for fine-tuning and a limited set of evaluation datasets, which may not fully capture the generalizability of the proposed method.
2. The cost-effectiveness analysis of the proposed method compared to using GPT-4 directly is not thoroughly discussed.

Strengths of Nemesis:
1. Investigates an overlooked aspect of soft-prompt tuning in VLMs, focusing on the norms of learnable soft-prompt vectors.
2. Introduces the novel concept of the 'Low-Norm Effect' and proposes two normalization losses (PUN and PAN) to harness this effect for improved VLM performance.
3. Conducts extensive experiments on a diverse set of 11 visual classification datasets, covering few-shot image classification, base-to-new generalization, and domain generalization tasks.
4. Provides insights into the impact of normalizing soft-prompt vectors on VLM performance.

Weaknesses of Nemesis:
1. The paper focuses on a specific aspect of soft-prompt tuning and may not address the broader challenges in VLM performance improvement.
2. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated only on the CLIP model with a ResNet-50 backbone, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other VLMs.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, the DebateGPT paper appears to have a more significant impact on the field of LLMs. It addresses a critical challenge in fine-tuning LLMs, proposes an innovative and cost-effective solution, and demonstrates its effectiveness through a well-designed experiment plan. The Nemesis paper, while introducing an interesting concept and providing valuable insights, has a narrower focus on a specific aspect of VLMs and may have limited generalizability.

Compositional Instruction Following with Language Models and Reinforcement Learning:
  Title: Compositional Instruction Following with Language Models and Reinforcement Learning
  Problem Statement: Combining reinforcement learning (RL) with language grounding is challenging because the agent needs to explore the environment for different language commands simultaneously. The problem is to reduce the sample complexity of RL tasks specified with language by using compositional policy representations.
  Motivation: Existing methods struggle with high sample complexity when grounding behaviors in RL due to the need to map a variety of potential language instructions to unknown corresponding behaviors. Pretraining and transfer learning have shown promise in natural language processing but lack effective pretrained policy representations in RL. Compositional policy learning, where solutions to previously-learned tasks can be composed to solve novel tasks, offers a potential solution. The proposed method leverages the compositional nature of language and policy representations to improve sample efficiency and generalization.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves two main phases: pretraining and downstream task learning. In the pretraining phase, a set of World Value Functions (WVFs) are learned, which can later be composed to solve new tasks. In the downstream task learning phase, a large language model (LLM) learns to semantically parse language instructions into Boolean compositions of WVFs using reinforcement learning. The method does not require supervised demonstrations and leverages in-context learning with feedback from environment rollouts to improve the semantic parsing capabilities of the LLM.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the BabyAI MiniGrid domain, which provides a test-bed for compositional language-RL tasks. Augment BabyAI with additional Boolean compositional tasks specified using intersection, disjunction, and negation.
    Step 2: Pretrain World Value Functions: Pretrain a set of WVFs for the basis tasks in the BabyAI environment. Each WVF takes as input an image observation and outputs values for accomplishing one of the basis tasks. Train nine WVFs corresponding to nine object attributes (three object types and six colors). Use CNN-DQN architectures for training. Pretraining takes nineteen million steps.
    Step 3: Construct Prompts: For the LLM agent, construct prompts to guide the model in generating Boolean expressions from language instructions. Use in-context examples selected using the BM25 retrieval algorithm. The LLM produces candidate Boolean expressions, which are then evaluated in the environment.
    Step 4: Select Models: Use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for the LLM agent. Implement a non-compositional baseline model based on the architecture used in the original BabyAI paper.
    Step 5: Train the LLM Agent: During downstream task learning, the LLM agent learns to semantically parse language instructions into Boolean compositions of WVFs using RL. Evaluate the policy defined by the WVF in the environment over 100 episode rollouts. Add successful parses to the set of in-context examples.
    Step 6: Evaluate Sample Complexity: Conduct experiments to evaluate sample complexity by learning all 162 tasks simultaneously. Plot the mean success rate against the number of environment steps. Compare the performance of the LLM agent to baseline agents and an Oracle agent.
    Step 7: Evaluate Generalization to Held-Out Tasks: Divide the task set in half and measure the ability of the agents to generalize to held-out novel tasks while learning from a fixed set of tasks. Compare the performance of the LLM agent to baseline agents.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Analyze the success rates and sample efficiency of the LLM agent compared to baseline agents. Evaluate the number of tasks solved and the quality of in-context examples accumulated by the LLM agent.

LMSYS-Chat-1M:
  Title: LMSYS-Chat-1M: A Large-Scale Real-World LLM Conversation Dataset
  Problem Statement: Understanding how people interact with large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios is crucial due to their widespread use in various applications. However, there is a lack of large-scale, diverse datasets of real-world LLM-user interactions, which hinders the study and improvement of LLM capabilities.
  Motivation: Existing datasets are either too small, lack diversity, or are proprietary and not publicly available. The operational costs of hosting an LLM service and the competitive nature of commercial LLM vendors make it difficult to collect and share such data. The proposed dataset, LMSYS-Chat-1M, aims to fill this gap by providing a large-scale, diverse, and publicly available dataset of real-world LLM conversations. This dataset can be used to develop content moderation models, build safety benchmarks, train instruction-following models, and create challenging benchmark questions.
  Proposed Method: LMSYS-Chat-1M is a dataset containing one million real-world conversations with 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, collected from 210K unique IP addresses on the Vicuna demo and Chatbot Arena website. The dataset includes raw conversation text, detected language tags, and OpenAI moderation API tags. The dataset is curated to remove personal identification information and flag unsafe and toxic content. The dataset is publicly available for research purposes.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The dataset is collected from the Vicuna demo and Chatbot Arena website from April to August 2023. It includes conversations from three types of chat interfaces: Single model, Chatbot Arena (battle), and Chatbot Arena (side-by-side).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For various use cases, different prompts are constructed. For content moderation, prompts are designed to generate explanations for why a particular message was flagged. For safety benchmarks, prompts are designed to test the model's vulnerability to jailbreak attacks. For instruction-following models, prompts are designed to generate high-quality user-LLM dialogues. For creating challenging benchmark questions, prompts are designed to filter out trivial or ambiguous user prompts.
    Step 3: Select Models: The dataset includes conversations with 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models. For experiments, models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Vicuna, Llama-2, and Claude are used.
    Step 4: Get Results: For content moderation, fine-tune a content moderation model using Vicuna-7B and evaluate its performance on a challenging benchmark. For safety benchmarks, compile a collection of jailbreak attempts and evaluate the model's vulnerability. For instruction-following models, fine-tune Llama2-7B on subsets of the dataset and compare its performance with Vicuna. For creating challenging benchmark questions, use LLMs to classify and filter prompts, and then evaluate model performance on the selected prompts.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed methods with baselines. For content moderation, compare the accuracy of the fine-tuned model with GPT-4 and other models. For safety benchmarks, compare the success rate of jailbreak attempts across different models. For instruction-following models, compare the performance of fine-tuned models on MMLU and MT-bench. For creating challenging benchmark questions, compare the effectiveness of the selected prompts in evaluating model performance.

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus and potential impact.

Paper 1 tackles the problem of compositional instruction following in reinforcement learning tasks using language models. The proposed method leverages the compositional nature of language and policy representations to improve sample efficiency and generalization. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured, starting with data gathering, pretraining world value functions, constructing prompts, selecting models, training the LLM agent, and evaluating sample complexity and generalization. The use of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for the LLM agent and the comparison with baseline agents demonstrate the potential of the proposed method. The paper addresses a significant challenge in combining RL with language grounding and offers a novel solution.

Paper 2 introduces LMSYS-Chat-1M, a large-scale dataset of real-world LLM conversations. The dataset fills a gap in the availability of diverse and publicly accessible datasets for studying LLM-user interactions. The dataset's size, diversity, and inclusion of conversations with 25 state-of-the-art LLMs make it a valuable resource for various research purposes, such as content moderation, safety benchmarks, instruction-following models, and challenging benchmark questions. The step-by-step experiment plan outlines the data collection process, prompt construction, model selection, and evaluation of the dataset's utility in different use cases. However, the paper primarily focuses on dataset creation and lacks a novel methodological contribution.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 1 is likely to be accepted by a top AI conference. The paper addresses a significant challenge in compositional instruction following, proposes a novel method that leverages the compositional nature of language and policy representations, and presents a well-structured experiment plan to evaluate the method's effectiveness. The potential impact of the proposed method in improving sample efficiency and generalization in RL tasks with language grounding makes it a strong candidate for acceptance.

In contrast, while Paper 2 introduces a valuable dataset, it lacks a novel methodological contribution. The creation of large-scale datasets, although important, is often not sufficient for acceptance in top AI conferences, which typically prioritize novel methods and algorithms.

paper 1:
LOLAMEME: LOGIC, LANGUAGE, MEMORY, MECHANISTIC FRAMEWORK:
  Title: LOLAMEME: LOGIC, LANGUAGE, MEMORY, MECHANISTIC FRAMEWORK
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but remain largely black-box models. The underlying mechanisms for their performance are often evaluated using synthetic or mechanistic schemes, which do not fully capture the nuances of natural language, such as logic, memory, and latent structure.
  Motivation: Existing mechanistic schemes are limited in their ability to evaluate the full range of language nuances. They often rely on synthetic datasets and do not incorporate aspects like logical reasoning, memory, and latent structures. The proposed LOLAMEME framework aims to fill this gap by providing a more comprehensive evaluation scheme that mimics natural language more closely. This framework is expected to offer a better understanding of different language model architectures and their capabilities.
  Proposed Method: The LOLAMEME framework extends current mechanistic schemes to include logic, memory, and language nuances. It introduces two instantiations: LoLa and MeMe languages, which differ in syntax but share the same semantics. The framework is used to evaluate two generative language model architectures: transformer-based GPT-2 and convolution-based Hyena. A hybrid architecture, T-HEX, is proposed, which combines elements of both GPT-2 and Hyena. T-HEX is shown to outperform both GPT-2 and Hyena on select tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Create multiple datasets based on the LOLAMEME framework, consisting of several billion tokens. The datasets should include various configurations to test different aspects of language, such as variable lengths, global variables, and logical reasoning.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, construct datasets using the LoLa and MeMe languages. Ensure that the datasets include a mix of global and local variables, different variable lengths, and logical reasoning tasks. The datasets should also include noise and latent types to mimic natural language more closely.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate the performance of three architectures: GPT-2 (124M), Hyena (153M), and the hybrid T-HEX model. T-HEX variations should include different layers of GPT-2 and Hyena to identify the optimal configuration.
    Step 4: Get Results: Run experiments to evaluate the models on various tasks defined by the LOLAMEME framework. Measure performance using metrics such as exact match and loss. Conduct experiments with different configurations, including varying the number of global variables, variable lengths, and input sizes.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of GPT-2, Hyena, and T-HEX across different tasks and configurations. Analyze which configurations of T-HEX perform best and why. Evaluate the models' ability to memorize, perform logical reasoning, and handle longer input lengths. Test the models on existing datasets like Listops to validate the findings.


paper 2:
Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG):
  Title: Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. This problem is significant because it limits the reliability and versatility of LLMs in generating accurate and useful responses across diverse tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) decrease factual inaccuracies by augmenting LMs with relevant knowledge retrieval. However, these methods often retrieve and incorporate a fixed number of passages indiscriminately, regardless of their relevance or necessity, which can diminish the versatility of LMs and lead to unhelpful responses. The proposed method, Self-RAG, aims to address these limitations by enabling adaptive retrieval and self-reflection, thereby improving the quality and factuality of LLM outputs.
  Proposed Method: Self-RAG enhances an LM's quality and factuality through adaptive retrieval and self-reflection. The framework trains a single arbitrary LM to retrieve passages on-demand, generate responses, and reflect on both retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens called reflection tokens. These tokens make the LM controllable during inference, allowing it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. The process involves three main steps: determining the necessity of retrieval, generating task outputs while evaluating the relevance of retrieved passages, and critiquing the generated outputs to select the best segment in terms of factuality and overall quality.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on six tasks: PubHealth (fact verification), ARC-Challenge (multiple-choice reasoning), PopQA (open-domain QA), TriviaQA-unfiltered (open-domain QA), biography generation, and ALCE-ASQA (long-form QA).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline models, prompt the LLMs to generate responses directly. For Self-RAG, prompt the model to generate an initial response, then use reflection tokens to decide if retrieval is necessary. If retrieval is needed, retrieve relevant passages and prompt the model to generate a response based on these passages. Finally, prompt the model to critique its own output using reflection tokens.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use Llama2 7B and 13B as the base LLMs for Self-RAG. Compare against other strong LLMs like ChatGPT, Llama2-chat, and Alpaca, as well as retrieval-augmented models like Ret-ChatGPT and Ret-Llama2-chat.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate responses for each task using both the baseline models and Self-RAG. Collect metrics such as accuracy for closed-set tasks, inclusion of gold answers for open-domain QA, FactScore for biography generation, and citation precision and recall for long-form QA.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Self-RAG against baseline models. Evaluate improvements in factual accuracy, citation precision, and overall response quality. Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of Self-RAG, such as the use of reflection tokens and adaptive retrieval.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose interesting ideas to address current limitations in large language models (LLMs). The LOLAMEME framework (Paper 1) aims to provide a more comprehensive evaluation scheme for LLMs by incorporating aspects like logic, memory, and latent structures. On the other hand, Self-RAG (Paper 2) focuses on improving the factual accuracy and versatility of LLMs through adaptive retrieval and self-reflection.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the lack of comprehensive evaluation schemes for LLMs
- Incorporates important aspects of natural language, such as logic, memory, and latent structures
- Proposes a novel hybrid architecture (T-HEX) that combines elements of GPT-2 and Hyena

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- Relies on synthetic datasets based on the LOLAMEME framework, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world language
- The proposed T-HEX architecture is not thoroughly evaluated against state-of-the-art models

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the problem of factual inaccuracies in LLM outputs
- Proposes a novel method (Self-RAG) that enables adaptive retrieval and self-reflection, improving the quality and factuality of LLM outputs
- Conducts experiments on a diverse set of real-world tasks, demonstrating the versatility of Self-RAG
- Compares Self-RAG against strong baseline models, including state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The effectiveness of Self-RAG may depend on the quality and relevance of the retrieved passages
- The use of reflection tokens may introduce additional computational overhead

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 2 (Self-RAG) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance. Its focus on improving the factual accuracy and versatility of LLMs through adaptive retrieval and self-reflection addresses a significant problem in the field. The experiments conducted on diverse real-world tasks and the comparison against strong baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. While Paper 1 (LOLAMEME) proposes an interesting evaluation framework, its reliance on synthetic datasets and lack of thorough comparison against state-of-the-art models make it less compelling than Paper 2.

Domain-Agnostic Molecular Generation with Chemical Feedback:
  Title: Domain-Agnostic Molecular Generation with Chemical Feedback
  Problem Statement: The generation of molecules with desired properties has become increasingly popular, revolutionizing the way scientists design molecular structures and providing valuable support for chemical and drug design. However, despite the potential of language models in molecule generation, they face challenges such as generating syntactically or chemically flawed molecules, having narrow domain focus, and struggling to create diverse and feasible molecules due to limited annotated data or external molecular databases.
  Motivation: Existing methods face several limitations: 1) They often generate syntactically or chemically invalid molecules. 2) They have a narrow domain focus, typically concentrating on synthetic molecules and neglecting natural products. 3) They struggle to create diverse and feasible molecules due to limited annotated data or reliance on external molecular databases. The proposed method, MolGen, aims to overcome these challenges by leveraging a pre-trained molecular language model tailored specifically for molecule generation. MolGen internalizes structural and grammatical insights through the reconstruction of over 100 million molecular SELFIES and employs domain-agnostic molecular prefix tuning to foster robust knowledge transfer across diverse domains. Additionally, a chemical feedback paradigm is introduced to steer the model away from 'molecular hallucinations', ensuring alignment between the model's estimated probabilities and real-world chemical preferences.
  Proposed Method: MolGen is a pre-trained molecular language model designed for efficient molecule generation. The approach comprises: 1) A two-stage domain-agnostic molecular pre-training. First, bidirectional and auto-regressive Transformers are trained to reconstruct over 100 million corrupted molecular SELFIES, endowing the model with a profound understanding of the structure, grammar, and intrinsic semantic information of SELFIES. Next, domain-agnostic molecular prefix tuning is leveraged to enable knowledge transfer across diverse domains, facilitating task adaptation. 2) A chemical feedback paradigm to alleviate 'molecular hallucinations'. By aligning the model’s generative probabilities with real-world chemical preferences, MolGen learns to evaluate and rectify its molecular outputs, ensuring the generation of chemically valid molecules with genuine utility and anticipated properties.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For pre-training, randomly select over 100 million unlabelled molecules from the publicly available ZINC-15 dataset. For the second stage, include 2.22 million molecules spanning both synthetic and natural product domains. For downstream tasks, use datasets such as MOSES for synthetic molecules and NPASS for natural products.
    Step 2: Model Architecture and Training Objectives: Use bidirectional and auto-regressive Transformers for the pre-training process. The first stage involves learning the structure, grammar, and intrinsic semantic information of SELFIES. The second stage involves domain-agnostic molecular prefix tuning to facilitate knowledge transfer across diverse domains. The chemical feedback paradigm is introduced to align the model’s generative probabilities with real-world chemical preferences.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the pre-trained MolGen model for all experiments. Compare with baselines such as JT-VAE, GCPN, MolDQN, LIMO, Chemformer, and others.
    Step 4: Conduct Experiments: 1) Molecular Distribution Learning: Generate 10,000 synthetic molecules and 80,000 natural product molecules using the pre-trained MolGen. Evaluate using metrics such as Validity, Fragment similarity (Frag), Scaffold similarity (Scaff), Similarity to the nearest neighbor (SNN), Internal diversity (IntDiv), Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD), and Novelty. 2) Targeted Molecule Discovery: Generate novel molecules with superior chemical properties such as penalized logP (p-logP) and QED. Evaluate the top-3 property scores of molecules generated on the synthetic dataset. 3) Constrained Molecular Optimization: Modify given molecules to improve desired properties while satisfying a similarity constraint. Optimize 800 molecules from the ZINC250K dataset that exhibit the lowest p-logP scores. Evaluate using Tanimoto similarity with Morgan fingerprints.
    Step 5: Get Results: Obtain predictions from the MolGen model on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method. For molecular distribution learning, compare the generated molecules with the reference set using the specified metrics. For targeted molecule discovery, compare the top-3 property scores with baselines. For constrained molecular optimization, compare the mean and standard deviation of penalized logP improvement with baselines.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance of MolGen in generating molecules with desired properties, capturing real-world molecular distributions, and mitigating 'molecular hallucinations'. Compare the results with baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Provide visualizations of the generated molecules and attention maps to further substantiate the claims.

QuantEase: Optimization-based Quantization for Large Language Models:
  Title: QuantEase: Optimization-based Quantization for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: With the rising popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been an increasing interest in compression techniques that enable their efficient deployment. This study focuses on the Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) of LLMs. The challenge is to reduce the memory footprint and inference latency of these models without significantly compromising their performance.
  Motivation: Existing PTQ methods like GPTQ and SpQR, while effective, still result in a noticeable drop in performance when compared to unquantized models. These methods often require complex operations like matrix inversion or decomposition, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. The inspiration behind QuantEase is to develop a more efficient and scalable quantization method that can achieve high-quality quantization with simpler operations, thereby improving performance metrics such as perplexity and zero-shot accuracy.
  Proposed Method: QuantEase is a layer-wise quantization framework that frames the quantization problem as a discrete-structured non-convex optimization problem. The method employs Coordinate Descent (CD) techniques to solve this problem. The CD-based approach involves straightforward updates using only matrix and vector operations, avoiding the need for matrix inversion or decomposition. QuantEase also includes an outlier-aware variant that retains significant weights (outliers) with complete precision. This approach allows for near or sub-3-bit quantization of LLMs with minimal accuracy loss.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use 128 sequences from the C4 dataset for training (calibration) data. For evaluation, we use the WikiText2 and PTB datasets for perplexity measurements, and the LAMBADA dataset for zero-shot accuracy.
    Step 2: Select Models: We evaluate QuantEase on several models from the OPT and BLOOM families, including models with parameters ranging from 350 million to 66 billion.
    Step 3: Implement QuantEase: Implement the QuantEase algorithm, which includes the following steps:
1. Initialize the weights.
2. Perform cyclic Coordinate Descent (CD) to update weights layer-wise.
3. For each layer, update weights using closed-form solutions derived from the optimization problem.
4. Implement the outlier-aware variant by dividing weights into quantized and unquantized sets, and use block coordinate descent for updates.
    Step 4: Compare Baselines: Compare QuantEase against existing PTQ methods like GPTQ, AWQ, and SpQR. For uniform quantization, compare against RTN, GPTQ, and AWQ. For outlier-aware quantization, compare against SpQR.
    Step 5: Get Results: Measure the performance of QuantEase in terms of perplexity on WikiText2 and PTB datasets, and zero-shot accuracy on the LAMBADA dataset. Record the runtime for each model to evaluate computational efficiency.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of QuantEase. Compare the perplexity and zero-shot accuracy improvements over the baselines. Evaluate the impact of the outlier-aware variant on achieving near or sub-3-bit quantization.

Both papers address important challenges in their respective domains. The first paper, "Domain-Agnostic Molecular Generation with Chemical Feedback," tackles the problem of generating diverse and chemically valid molecules using language models. The proposed method, MolGen, leverages a pre-trained molecular language model and introduces a chemical feedback paradigm to ensure the generation of feasible molecules. The strengths of this paper include its domain-agnostic approach, which enables knowledge transfer across diverse domains, and the incorporation of chemical feedback to mitigate 'molecular hallucinations'. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured and includes a comprehensive evaluation using various metrics and datasets.

On the other hand, the second paper, "QuantEase: Optimization-based Quantization for Large Language Models," focuses on the post-training quantization of large language models to reduce memory footprint and inference latency. The proposed method, QuantEase, frames the quantization problem as a discrete-structured non-convex optimization problem and employs Coordinate Descent techniques for efficient optimization. The strengths of this paper lie in its scalability and the ability to achieve high-quality quantization with simpler operations compared to existing methods. The outlier-aware variant further enhances the quantization performance by retaining significant weights with complete precision.

While both papers make valuable contributions, the second paper, "QuantEase," appears to have a more significant impact on the field of natural language processing and large language models. The efficient quantization of LLMs is a critical challenge that directly affects their deployment and usability in real-world applications. QuantEase's ability to achieve near or sub-3-bit quantization with minimal accuracy loss is a notable advancement. The paper's focus on computational efficiency and the inclusion of an outlier-aware variant further strengthen its contribution. Additionally, the evaluation plan, which includes a comparison against multiple baselines and the use of diverse datasets, demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method.

In contrast, while the first paper addresses an important problem in molecular generation, its impact on the broader field of natural language processing and large language models is relatively limited. The domain-specific nature of the problem and the focus on molecular generation may have a narrower audience compared to the more general challenge of LLM quantization.

DP-OPT: Make Large Language Model Your Privacy-Preserving Prompt Engineer:
  Title: DP-OPT: Make Large Language Model Your Privacy-Preserving Prompt Engineer
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for various tasks, especially when fine-tuned with specific prompts. However, the dependency on sensitive private information for prompt tuning raises significant data privacy concerns. The challenge is to optimize prompts privately without compromising data confidentiality or model ownership.
  Motivation: Existing methods either require hosting a local LLM, which is impractical due to model ownership protection, or sending data to the model's provider, which intensifies privacy issues. The proposed method, Differentially-Private Offsite Prompt Tuning (DP-OPT), aims to address these challenges by enabling private prompt tuning on the client side and transferring the tuned prompts to cloud models without significant performance loss. This method ensures data confidentiality, information privacy, and model ownership protection.
  Proposed Method: DP-OPT involves tuning a discrete prompt on the client side and then applying it to the desired cloud models. The method uses a differentially-private (DP) ensemble of in-context learning with private demonstrations to generate privacy-preserving prompts. The process includes two main steps: Private Prompt Engineering and Prompt Transfer. The private prompt generation mechanism ensures that the prompts do not leak private information.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use sentiment classification tasks including SST-2 from the GLUE benchmark, Trec, Mpqa, and Disaster datasets. These datasets cover various aspects of sentiment analysis and classification.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, use initial instructions for each task. For the proposed method, use the DP-OPT algorithm to generate privacy-preserving prompts. The initial instructions for each task are as follows:
- SST-2: 'Classify the input text as positive or negative.'
- Trec: 'Read the following question, then choose whether it is about a description, entity, expression, human, location, or number.'
- Mpqa: 'Read the following review, then choose whether it is negative or positive.'
- Disaster: 'Read the following sentence, then choose whether it is relevant to a disaster.'
    Step 3: Select Models: Use Vicuna-7b as the local model for training prompts. Test the transferability of the prompts on larger models including Vicuna-33b, Llama-2-13b, Llama-2-70b, and DaVinci-003.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the generated prompts on the test sets of the datasets. Compare the accuracy of the prompts on both the local model (Vicuna-7b) and the target models (Vicuna-33b, Llama-2-13b, Llama-2-70b, and DaVinci-003).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of DP-OPT with non-private baselines (ICL, PromptSGD) and private baselines (PromptDPSGD). Assess the privacy-utility trade-off by varying the privacy parameters and analyzing the impact on test accuracy. Evaluate the empirical privacy risks using membership inference attacks and compare the results with the proposed method.

Protein Language Models Enable Accurate Cryptic Ligand Binding Pocket Prediction:
  Title: Protein Language Models Enable Accurate Cryptic Ligand Binding Pocket Prediction
  Problem Statement: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding pockets is a critical task in protein functional analysis and small molecule pharmaceutical design. However, the flexible and dynamic nature of proteins conceals an unknown number of potentially invaluable 'cryptic' pockets. Current approaches for cryptic pocket discovery rely on molecular dynamics (MD), leading to poor scalability and bias.
  Motivation: Existing methods for cryptic pocket discovery, such as MD simulations, are time-consuming, costly, and not scalable. Even recent ML-based approaches require large, post-processed MD datasets to train their models. The proposed method, Efficient Sequence-based cryptic Pocket prediction (ESP), leverages advanced Protein Language Models (PLMs) to improve predictive efficacy without the need for costly simulations and post-processing. The hypothesis is that PLMs can learn meaningful representations from protein sequences that can be used to predict cryptic pockets more accurately and efficiently.
  Proposed Method: ESP uses advanced PLMs to predict cryptic ligand binding pockets from protein sequences. The method involves training on readily available, non-cryptic-pocket-specific data from the PDBBind dataset. The PLMs used include Ankh-Large, ESM-2 15B, ESM-2 3B, ProtT5-XL, and ProtBert. The embeddings from these PLMs are then used to train various prediction heads, including logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and multi-headed attention (MHA) architectures. The model is trained to predict residue-level cryptic pocket scores, and optionally, secondary structure prediction (SSP) labels.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the PDBBind dataset for training, which contains 17,986 protein-ligand complexes. Use the ESM-2 SSP dataset for multi-task learning. Use the PocketMiner (PM) validation and test sets for evaluation.
    Step 2: Data Preparation: Extract amino acid sequences from the PDBBind dataset. Assign positive labels to residues within 6 Å of any ligand atom and negative labels to all other residues. Ensure no data leakage by removing training samples with greater than 30% sequence identity to validation or test samples.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the following PLMs: Ankh-Large, ESM-2 15B, ESM-2 3B, ProtT5-XL, and ProtBert. Calculate embeddings for each protein sequence using these PLMs.
    Step 4: Train Prediction Heads: Train various prediction heads (LR, MLP, MHA) using the embeddings from the PLMs. Optionally, use multi-task learning with SSP labels. Use binary cross-entropy loss for cryptic pocket prediction and cross-entropy loss for SSP. Use SGD with a momentum value of 0.9 for optimization.
    Step 5: Evaluate Models: Evaluate the models on the PM validation and test sets. Calculate metrics such as Average Precision Score (APS) and Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROCAUC).
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of ESP with different PLMs and prediction heads against the SOTA method, PocketMiner. Analyze the spatial distribution of positive signals in the predictions to assess their utility for pharmaceutical discovery.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important problems in their respective domains using advanced machine learning techniques. However, there are notable differences in the clarity, novelty, and potential impact of the two proposals.

Paper 1 (DP-OPT) tackles the critical issue of privacy in prompt tuning for large language models. The proposed method, Differentially-Private Offsite Prompt Tuning (DP-OPT), offers a novel solution to enable private prompt tuning on the client side while maintaining data confidentiality and model ownership protection. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured, covering various datasets, models, and evaluation metrics. The analysis of privacy-utility trade-offs and empirical privacy risks demonstrates a comprehensive approach to validating the proposed method.

Paper 2 (ESP) addresses the problem of predicting cryptic ligand binding pockets in proteins using protein language models (PLMs). While the problem is important in the field of protein functional analysis and drug discovery, the proposed method lacks the same level of novelty as Paper 1. The use of PLMs for this task is an interesting approach, but the paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing methods or highlight the specific advantages of using PLMs over other techniques. The experiment plan is well-organized but lacks a detailed analysis of the potential impact and limitations of the proposed method.

Considering the novelty, clarity, and potential impact of the two proposals, Paper 1 (DP-OPT) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The problem of privacy in prompt tuning is highly relevant to the current state of large language models, and the proposed solution is both innovative and well-presented. In contrast, while Paper 2 (ESP) addresses an important problem, the novelty and potential impact of the proposed method are less clear.

Generating Robot Policy Code for High-Precision and Contact-Rich Manipulation Tasks:
  Title: Generating Robot Policy Code for High-Precision and Contact-Rich Manipulation Tasks
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful at generating robot policy code for high-level tasks that do not require accurate movement. However, it remains an open question how well these models can perform in high-precision, contact-rich tasks that require controlling contact forces with the environment.
  Motivation: Existing methods have shown success in generating robot policy code for high-level tasks but fall short in tasks requiring precise control and contact with the environment. These tasks are more complex due to the need for accurate force control and compliance with environmental constraints. The proposed method aims to leverage LLMs' capabilities by reparameterizing the action space to include robot compliance with constraints on interaction forces and stiffnesses, thereby improving the success rates in high-precision, contact-rich tasks.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves reparameterizing the action space to include robot compliance with constraints on interaction forces and stiffnesses. This approach allows LLMs to generate policies for contact-rich and high-precision manipulation tasks in a zero-shot fashion. The method is validated on subtasks derived from the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB) and the IROS 2020 Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition, showing significant improvements in success rates over baselines that use free space motions.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use subtasks derived from the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB) and the IROS 2020 Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition. These datasets include tasks like peg insertion and cable routing/un-routing.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Prompt for FMB Tasks: You're a robot trying to insert a peg in a hole. Grab the circular peg. Use the following methods: move, move_compliant, etc. Here is an example: move(translation=[0.01, 0.0, 0.0], constraint='force.x < 3').
      Prompt for IROS Tasks: You're a robot holding a cable that's threaded through a tunnel with a small opening at the top. You need to unroute the cable by removing it from the tunnel. Use the following methods: cartesian_admittance_move, etc. Here is an example: cartesian_admittance_move(target_pose=pose(1).multiply(pose3_rpy(translation=[0, 0, -.01])), termination_condition=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition(operation=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition.ANY_OF, conditions=[contact_condition, position_condition])).
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-4 as the underlying LLM for generating the robot policy code.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate policy code using the LLM for both the FMB and IROS tasks. Execute the generated code on a Universal Robotics UR5e robot equipped with an ATI Axia80 force-torque sensor.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the success rates of the generated policies against baseline methods. Evaluate the performance based on the ability to complete the tasks successfully, focusing on the improvement in success rates over non-compliant action spaces.

Quantifying Language Models' Sensitivity to Spurious Features in Prompt Design:
  Title: Quantifying Language Models' Sensitivity to Spurious Features in Prompt Design or: How I learned to start worrying about prompt formatting
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting, which can lead to significant performance variations. This sensitivity poses a challenge for accurately characterizing and comparing LLM performance, as current practices often rely on a single prompt format.
  Motivation: Existing methods typically evaluate LLMs using a single prompt format, which can lead to misleading conclusions about model performance. The sensitivity of LLMs to prompt formatting choices is not well-characterized, and this can introduce significant biases in performance evaluation. The proposed method aims to systematically analyze and report the performance spread across a range of plausible prompt formats, providing a more robust evaluation framework.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, FormatSpread, systematically evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task and reports the interval of expected performance. This method uses Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the space of prompt formats under a user-specified computational budget, without requiring access to model weights. Additionally, the method includes a suite of analyses to characterize the nature of LLM sensitivity to formatting choices.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use a subset of 53 tasks from Super-NaturalInstructions, which includes diverse human-written formats and instructions. The tasks are selected based on criteria such as dataset size, input length, and the presence of human-generated formats.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each task, we construct prompts by concatenating the task's instruction with n formatted few-shot examples and a data point to solve. The few-shot examples are formatted using a grammar that defines the space of plausible prompt formats. We ensure that the final prompt template is consistent with the chosen format.
    Step 3: Select Models: We evaluate several widely-used open-source LLMs, including LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-13B, LLaMA-2-70B, Falcon-7B, Falcon-7B-Instruct, and GPT-3.5-Turbo.
    Step 4: Get Results: We compute the performance spread for each model and task by evaluating the models on a set of 10 randomly sampled prompt formats. We use two accuracy metrics: exact prefix matching and probability ranking. We also analyze the influence of individual formatting features on model performance.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: We compare the performance spread across different models, model sizes, and few-shot settings. We also investigate the correlation between prompt embeddings and performance spread, and evaluate the efficiency of the FormatSpread algorithm using Thompson sampling, UCB sampling, and naive sampling.

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus and potential impact.

Paper 1 tackles the problem of generating robot policy code for high-precision and contact-rich manipulation tasks using LLMs. The proposed method of reparameterizing the action space to include robot compliance with constraints on interaction forces and stiffnesses is novel and has the potential to significantly improve success rates in complex manipulation tasks. The experiment plan is well-structured, using established benchmarks and a real robot setup for validation. The results could have a substantial impact on the application of LLMs in robotics and automation.

Paper 2 addresses the issue of LLM sensitivity to prompt formatting and its impact on performance evaluation. The proposed FormatSpread method provides a systematic approach to analyze and report performance spread across plausible prompt formats, offering a more robust evaluation framework. The experiment plan is comprehensive, using a diverse set of tasks and models, and includes in-depth analyses of the influence of formatting features on model performance. While the results could provide valuable insights into LLM behavior and improve evaluation practices, the immediate impact on real-world applications may be less significant compared to Paper 1.

Considering the novelty, potential impact, and the well-structured experiment plan, Paper 1 appears to be a stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The proposed method directly addresses a critical challenge in applying LLMs to real-world robotics tasks, and the results could lead to significant advancements in the field. In contrast, while Paper 2 offers valuable insights into LLM evaluation, its impact on practical applications may be less immediate.

Masked Structural Growth for 2x Faster Language Model Pre-training:
  Title: Masked Structural Growth for 2x Faster Language Model Pre-training
  Problem Statement: Accelerating large language model pre-training is a critical issue in present research. The excessive computational cost of pre-training is a bottleneck, causing delays in research cycles and increased carbon footprints. The challenge is to speed up pre-training while still producing large-scale models.
  Motivation: Existing methods like structured pruning can expedite pre-training but result in smaller models with inferior performance and knowledge capacity. Progressive growth from smaller models to larger ones is an intuitive idea inspired by neurogenesis in the human brain. However, existing work has not fully explored the impact of each growth dimension on schedule efficiency and relies on non-strict function-preserving growth operators that depend on the initialization of new weights, limiting further improvements in training dynamics.
  Proposed Method: We propose Masked Structural Growth (MSG), a novel progressive learning framework for language model pre-training with Transformers. MSG includes (i) growth schedules involving all possible dimensions and (ii) strictly function-preserving growth operators that are independent of the initialization of new weights. The main idea is to use a masking mechanism to ensure function preservation by first eliminating the effects of new neurons and then gradually enhancing their roles in subsequent training.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use a pre-processed combination of English Wikipedia and Book Corpus for Bert models, and OpenWebText for GPT-2.
    Step 2: Construct Growth Schedules: We construct growth schedules for both Bert and GPT models. For Bert-base, we use Sch1-B: (512,768,8,3) -> (512,3072,8,3) -> (512,3072,8,6) -> (768,3072,8,6) -> (768,3072,12,6) -> (768,3072,12,12). For Bert-large, we use Sch1-L: (768,1024,12,6) -> (768,4096,12,6) -> (768,4096,12,12) -> (1024,4096,12,12) -> (1024,4096,16,12) -> (1024,4096,16,24). For GPT-2, we use Sch1-G: (512,768,8,3) -> (512,3072,8,3) -> (512,3072,8,6) -> (768,3072,8,6) -> (768,3072,12,6) -> (768,3072,12,12).
    Step 3: Select Models: We train both Bert-base and Bert-large using the pre-processed datasets, and GPT-2 using OpenWebText. The target models are Bert-base (110M parameters), Bert-large (336M parameters), and GPT-2 (110M parameters).
    Step 4: Pre-train Models: For Bert models, we train for 1M steps with a learning rate of (1e-4,1e-5) and warm-up step of (10k,30k) for (Bert-base, Bert-large), respectively. For GPT-2, we train with a sequence length of 1024 and a batch size of 140 for 240k steps. We use a learning rate of 1e-4 and a learning rate warmup ratio of 0.01.
    Step 5: Fine-tune Models: For Bert models, we fine-tune on the GLUE and SQuADv1.1 tasks. For GPT-2, we fine-tune on Wikitext2. We use a batch size of 32, sequence length of 128, and learning rate of 2e-5 for GLUE tasks, and a batch size of 12 and learning rate of 3e-5 for SQuAD. For Wikitext2, we use a learning rate of 1e-4 for 3 epochs with a sequence length of 1024 and a batch size of 8.
    Step 6: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks. We report the mean and standard deviation of the metrics across 3 runs on the dev set. For Bert models, we evaluate on GLUE and SQuADv1.1 tasks. For GPT-2, we evaluate on Wikitext2.

Lightweight Unsupervised Federated Learning with Pretrained Vision Language Model:
  Title: Lightweight Unsupervised Federated Learning with Pretrained Vision Language Model
  Problem Statement: Federated learning aims to solve the 'isolated data island' problem by training a collective model from physically isolated clients while preserving user data privacy. However, supervised federated learning requires each client to label their data, which is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and impractical for edge devices. Additionally, the training and transmission of deep models challenge the computational and communication capabilities of clients.
  Motivation: Existing supervised federated learning methods are not feasible for edge devices due to the high cost of data annotation and the computational and communication overhead. The proposed method leverages pretrained vision-language models like CLIP to perform lightweight unsupervised federated learning. By using the zero-shot prediction capability and the well-trained image encoder of CLIP, the method aims to refine pseudo-labels and perform efficient model training and communication. This approach is expected to enhance model performance while reducing computational and communication costs.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Federated Self-Training with Class-Balanced Data Generation (FST-CBDG), involves the following steps: 1) Utilize the pretrained CLIP model to generate initial pseudo-labels for unlabeled data on each client. 2) Train a lightweight linear classifier on top of the fixed CLIP image encoder using a self-training approach that refines pseudo-labels through moving average updates. 3) Address data heterogeneity by generating synthetic instances in the feature space using a class-balanced text feature sampling strategy. The method aims to improve the quality of pseudo-labels and enhance overall model performance while minimizing computational and communication overhead.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Conduct experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10 datasets. Partition the data among 100 clients with no overlap, ensuring both homogeneous (i.i.d.) and heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) data distribution settings.
    Step 2: Model Preparation: Use the pretrained CLIP model (RN50 variant) for the image encoder and a modified Transformer model for the text encoder. Extract textual features for each class using the CLIP text encoder and initialize the linear classifier with these features.
    Step 3: Local Training: On each client, extract image features using the fixed CLIP image encoder. Generate initial pseudo-labels using the zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP. Train the linear classifier using a self-training approach with moving average updates for pseudo-labels. Generate synthetic instances using a class-balanced Gaussian sampling strategy to address data heterogeneity.
    Step 4: Communication and Aggregation: In each communication round, clients upload the updated linear classifier parameters to the server. The server aggregates these updates using a simple average aggregation procedure (FedAvg) and sends the aggregated parameters back to the clients.
    Step 5: Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the testing data. Compare the results with baseline methods (CLIP-ZS, CLIP-FC-Centralized) and supervised federated learning methods (FedAvg, FedNTD) in terms of testing accuracy and computational and communication efficiency.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the improvements in model performance achieved by the proposed method compared to the baselines. Assess the impact of the self-training approach and class-balanced data generation on the quality of pseudo-labels and overall model performance.

paper 1:
EvoPrompt:
  Title: Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. The problem is to automate the process of prompt optimization to reduce human effort and improve the performance of LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods for prompt optimization either require access to the token probabilities from the output layer of LLMs, which may not always be accessible, or they focus on exploring diverse prompts or modifying current prompts, which can lead to inefficiencies and local optima. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are well-suited for optimization tasks due to their balance between exploration and exploitation and their ability to work without gradients or parameters. By connecting LLMs with EAs, we can leverage the language processing capabilities of LLMs and the optimization performance of EAs to create a more efficient and effective prompt optimization framework.
  Proposed Method: We propose EvoPrompt, a framework that connects LLMs with EAs for discrete prompt optimization. EvoPrompt starts with a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts using LLMs based on evolutionary operators. The process involves three main steps: 1) Initial population: Combining manual prompts and LLM-generated prompts to ensure diversity. 2) Evolution: Using LLMs to perform mutation and crossover operations on selected parent prompts to generate new candidate prompts. 3) Update: Evaluating the new prompts on a development set and retaining the best-performing ones. This process is repeated for a predefined number of iterations to improve the quality of the prompts.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate EvoPrompt on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, and BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. The datasets include SST-2, CR, MR, SST-5, AG’s News, TREC, Subj, SAMSum, ASSET, and 22 BBH tasks.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the initial population, we use a combination of manual prompts and prompts generated by GPT-3.5. For example, for sentiment classification, a manual prompt could be 'Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence, assign a sentiment label from [‘negative’, ‘positive’]. Return label only without any other text.'
    Step 3: Select Models: We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca-7b.
    Step 4: Implement Evolutionary Algorithms:
      GA:
        Selection: Use roulette wheel selection to choose two parent prompts based on their performance scores.
        Evolution: Perform crossover and mutation operations using LLMs to generate new candidate prompts.
        Update: Merge the new prompts with the existing population and retain the top-performing ones.
      DE:
        Selection: Randomly select two parent prompts and identify the different parts between them.
        Evolution: Mutate the different parts and combine them with the current best prompt to generate a new candidate prompt.
        Update: Perform crossover with a basic prompt and retain the better-performing prompt.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the optimized prompts on the test sets of the datasets and compare the performance with human-engineered prompts and existing automatic prompt generation methods.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance improvements achieved by EvoPrompt on various tasks. For example, on the SST-2 dataset, compare the accuracy of the optimized prompts with the baseline manual prompts and other automatic methods.

Plan-based Prompting Improves Literature Review Generation:
  Title: Plan-based Prompting Improves Literature Review Generation
  Problem Statement: The task of writing the literature review of a scientific research paper is challenging, especially when conditioned on its abstract and the content of related papers. This task is crucial for the scientific process but is exacerbated by the rapid pace of progress in fields like machine learning, where relevant papers appear frequently. Modern large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate content and cite imaginary papers, making it difficult to generate accurate and high-quality literature reviews.
  Motivation: Existing methods for literature review generation using LLMs often result in hallucinated content and citations of non-existent papers. While LLMs can be trained or prompted to condition on all abstracts of papers to be cited, this approach does not always yield high-quality results. The proposed method introduces an intermediate planning step, which is inspired by traditional modular pipelines in Natural Language Generation. This planning step is expected to improve the quality of the generated literature reviews by providing a structured approach to content generation.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a two-step process: first, generating a plan for the literature review, and then using this plan to generate the actual text. The plan includes a line-by-line description of the passage to write, including citations. This approach allows for better control over the output and is likely to meet author preferences and publication constraints. The method can be used in an interactive, iterative writing assistance system where the user can edit the plan and regenerate the result.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use the Multi-XScience dataset for our experiments. This dataset includes the abstracts and related work sections of scientific papers. We also create a new test corpus (MXS-2308) consisting of recent arXiv papers (with full content) posted after the release of both open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs used in our study.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the plan-based approach, we prompt the model to generate a plan for the literature review. The plan specifies the number of sentences, the number of words, and the citations to be included at specific lines. Example prompt: 'Please generate 5 sentences in 120 words. Cite @cite_1 at line 1 and 3. Cite @cite_2 at line 2 and 5. Cite @cite_3 at line 4 and 5.' For the vanilla zero-shot generation, we prompt the model to generate the literature review directly from the abstracts of the query and reference papers.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use both open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs for our experiments. Open-sourced models include different versions of Llama 2-Chat (7B, 13B, 70B). Closed-sourced models include GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate literature reviews using both the plan-based and vanilla zero-shot approaches. Collect the generated outputs for evaluation.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Evaluate the quality of the generated literature reviews using ROUGE scores and human evaluation. Compare the performance of the plan-based approach with the vanilla zero-shot generation. Analyze the coverage of citations and the adherence to the generated plans. Additionally, use automatic LLM evaluation to assess the quality of the generated text.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose interesting ideas for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in different tasks. However, there are some key differences in their approaches and the potential impact of their work.

Paper 1 (EvoPrompt) focuses on automating the process of prompt optimization using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The main strength of this approach is that it can reduce human effort in crafting effective prompts and potentially improve the performance of LLMs across a wide range of tasks. The authors propose a well-structured experiment plan, covering diverse datasets and models. The step-by-step implementation of the evolutionary algorithms (GA and DE) is clearly outlined. The proposed method is likely to be of interest to the AI community as it addresses a common challenge in using LLMs effectively.

On the other hand, Paper 2 (Plan-based Prompting) targets a specific task: generating literature reviews for scientific papers. While this is an important problem, it has a narrower scope compared to Paper 1. The proposed method of using a planning step to guide the generation process is novel and could potentially improve the quality of the generated reviews. However, the experiment plan is less comprehensive than Paper 1, focusing only on one dataset (Multi-XScience) and a smaller set of models. The evaluation metrics (ROUGE scores and human evaluation) are appropriate but may not provide a complete picture of the method's effectiveness.

Considering the broader impact, scalability, and the thoroughness of the experiment plan, Paper 1 (EvoPrompt) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The proposed method has the potential to benefit a wider range of tasks and users, and the authors have demonstrated a rigorous approach to evaluating its effectiveness.

paper 1:
Listen, Think, and Understand:
  Title: Listen, Think, and Understand
  Problem Statement: The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perceive and comprehend audio signals is crucial for many applications. However, most existing models are designed to map audio inputs to pre-defined, discrete sound label sets, lacking the ability to explain predictions, infer implications, and understand scenes and necessary actions.
  Motivation: Humans can classify sounds into general categories, listen to finer details, explain predictions, infer implications, and understand scenes and necessary actions. Existing audio models lack these capabilities. Modern large language models (LLMs) exhibit reasoning abilities but lack audio perception capabilities. The motivation is to build a model that combines both audio perception and reasoning abilities, surpassing the limitations of existing models.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method is a new audio foundation model called LTU (Listen, Think, and Understand). LTU is trained using a new OpenAQA-5M dataset consisting of 1.9 million closed-ended and 3.7 million open-ended (audio, question, answer) tuples. An autoregressive training framework with a perception-to-understanding curriculum is used. LTU integrates a high-performance audio perception model AST with an open-source LLM LLaMA. The model demonstrates strong performance on conventional audio tasks and exhibits emerging audio reasoning and comprehension abilities.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The OpenAQA-5M dataset is created by combining 8 mainstream audio datasets: AudioSet-Strong, AudioSet, VGGSound, FSD50K, AudioCaps, Freesound, Clotho, and Sound Bible. The dataset includes 1.9 million closed-ended and 3.7 million open-ended (audio, question, answer) tuples.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For closed-ended tasks, questions are paraphrased with GPT-3.5-Turbo assistance, and answers are generated with a rule-based algorithm. For open-ended tasks, the Audio Instruction Generation (AIG) method is used to generate diverse questions and answers based on audio meta-information.
    Step 3: Select Models: The LTU model integrates the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) pretrained with the CA V-MAE objective and finetuned on AudioSet-2M as the audio encoder, and the LLaMA-7B large language model with Vicuna instruction following training.
    Step 4: Training Objective: LTU is trained on the next token prediction task conditioning on the past tokens and the reference audio, maximizing P(xt|x1:t−1, A) through cross-entropy for all 1 < t ≤ T given text sequence x1:T and the reference audio A.
    Step 5: Training Curriculum: A perception-to-understanding curriculum is used. Stage 1: Train the audio projection layer with closed-ended classification and acoustic feature description tasks. Stage 2: Train all parameters (excluding LLaMA) with classification and acoustic feature description tasks. Stage 3: Train all parameters with all closed-ended tasks. Stage 4: Train all parameters with all closed-ended and open-ended tasks.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate LTU on 8 audio classification benchmarks (ESC50, DCASE, VGGSound, TUT, Beijing Opera, VocalSound, FSD50K, AudioSet) and 2 audio captioning benchmarks (AudioCaps, Clotho). Additionally, evaluate LTU's emerging audio reasoning capabilities on open-ended tasks using human subjective evaluation and GPT-4 assisted evaluation.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare LTU's performance on closed-ended tasks with existing models like CLAP and specialized models. Analyze LTU's performance on open-ended tasks through human subjective evaluation and GPT-4 assisted evaluation to assess instruction following rate and factual correctness.


paper 2:
TCD: Text Image Change Detection for Multilingual Document Comparison:
  Title: TCD: TEXT IMAGE CHANGE DETECTION FOR MULTILINGUAL DOCUMENT COMPARISON
  Problem Statement: The core technology used in imaged document comparison is based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, OCR has significant drawbacks, such as the need for relevant language models for each document and poor recognition performance for multilingual documents. This makes it challenging to maintain consistent OCR performance across different languages, especially in global transactions and contracts where multiple languages are involved.
  Motivation: Existing OCR-based methods require users to select appropriate language models for each document, and multilingual documents necessitate either a multilingual OCR model or a hybrid model, both of which have poor recognition performance. The proposed method aims to overcome these limitations by using image change detection without recognition, making it language-independent. The inspiration behind the new method is to directly compare text area images instead of recognizing text, which can handle multilingual documents more effectively.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, TCD, utilizes unit-level text image-to-image comparison instead of text recognition. The model generates change segmentation maps in both directions (source to target and target to source). It employs a correlation between multi-scale attention features to mitigate the need for pre-processing text image position and scale alignment. The architecture is based on an Encoder-Decoder model with shared weights, using ResNet as the backbone. Multi-level features are extracted, and cross and cross-self attention mechanisms are applied to enhance feature representation. A 4-D correlation map is constructed using cosine similarity, and marginalized to create 3-D correlation tensors. The final segmentation maps are generated using convolutions and upsampling, with a combination of Dice Loss and Binary Cross-Entropy loss for training.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Create test data from printed and scanned documents in different languages, and add public datasets such as Distorted Document Images (DDI-100) and Document Binarization Dataset (LRDE DBD). Prepare two kinds of datasets: segmentation test dataset and OCR test dataset.
    Step 2: Construct Training Data: Generate synthetic training data using a text corpus from English, Korean, Chinese, Numbers, and special characters. Create pairs of source and target images with ground truth change areas. Apply various augmentations to simulate real document changes and distortions.
    Step 3: Train Models: Train the TCD model for 200 epochs with a batch size of 8. Use multi-scale feature maps and correlation marginalized maps for text image change detection. Train other semantic segmentation and change detection models (U-Net, SegFormer, BIT-CD, SARAS-Net) using the same synthetic training data for fair comparison.
    Step 4: Evaluate Models: Evaluate the performance of the TCD model and other models on the segmentation test dataset using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, IoU, and overall accuracy. Evaluate OCR models (Tesseract OCR, Multiplex OCR, PPOcr v3) on the OCR test dataset using image-level classification performance scores.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the TCD model with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and change detection models, as well as OCR models. Perform ablation studies to analyze the utility of each module in the TCD model. Visualize prediction results to assess the quality of segmentation maps.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers propose novel approaches to address challenges in their respective domains. Paper 1 focuses on developing an audio foundation model that combines audio perception and reasoning abilities, while Paper 2 aims to overcome the limitations of OCR-based methods for multilingual document comparison using image change detection.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the lack of reasoning abilities in existing audio models by integrating a high-performance audio perception model with a large language model.
- Proposes a new OpenAQA-5M dataset with a large number of closed-ended and open-ended (audio, question, answer) tuples.
- Employs a perception-to-understanding curriculum for training, which gradually builds the model's capabilities.
- Evaluates the model on a wide range of audio classification and captioning benchmarks, as well as open-ended tasks using human subjective evaluation and GPT-4 assisted evaluation.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The integration of the audio perception model and large language model may introduce computational complexity and scalability challenges.
- The effectiveness of the proposed method heavily relies on the quality and diversity of the OpenAQA-5M dataset, which may have limitations or biases.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Proposes a language-independent approach for multilingual document comparison using image change detection, overcoming the limitations of OCR-based methods.
- Utilizes a correlation between multi-scale attention features to mitigate the need for pre-processing text image position and scale alignment.
- Employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture with shared weights and attention mechanisms to enhance feature representation.
- Evaluates the model on both segmentation and OCR test datasets, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation, change detection, and OCR models.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The proposed method relies on synthetic training data, which may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of real-world multilingual documents.
- The effectiveness of the model may be limited by the quality and variety of the synthetic training data generated.

Comparison and Decision:
While both papers propose innovative approaches, Paper 1 stands out due to its potential impact on the field of audio understanding. The integration of audio perception and reasoning abilities in a single model is a significant advancement, and the proposed OpenAQA-5M dataset provides a valuable resource for future research. Additionally, the comprehensive evaluation plan, including both closed-ended and open-ended tasks, demonstrates the model's capabilities and potential real-world applications.

In contrast, Paper 2, although addressing an important challenge in multilingual document comparison, relies heavily on synthetic training data and may have limitations in real-world scenarios. The evaluation plan, while thorough, does not provide as much insight into the model's reasoning abilities and potential impact on the field.

Therefore, based on the strengths, weaknesses, and potential impact, Paper 1 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

Human Feedback is not Gold Standard:
  Title: Human Feedback is not Gold Standard
  Problem Statement: Human feedback has become the de facto standard for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is increasingly being used as a training objective. However, it is not clear which properties of a generated output this single 'preference' score captures. The paper hypothesizes that preference scores are subjective and open to undesirable biases.
  Motivation: While human feedback is widely used, it is not clear if it fully captures a range of crucial error criteria. Existing methods may not adequately represent important aspects like factuality. The paper aims to critically analyze the use of human feedback for both training and evaluation to verify whether it fully captures a range of crucial error criteria. The authors hypothesize that both preference scores and error annotation may be affected by confounders such as assertiveness and complexity.
  Proposed Method: The authors propose a critical analysis of human feedback for both training and evaluation of LLMs. They establish a set of error types that are task-independent and act as minimum requirements for model outputs. They then analyze the error coverage of overall preference scores by asking two sets of annotators to rate a range of LLM outputs. Additionally, they generate outputs with varying assertiveness and complexity to study the effect of these confounders on human annotations. Finally, they offer preliminary evidence that using human feedback as a training objective disproportionately increases the assertiveness of model outputs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets used include Curation Corpus (summarization dataset), Amazon Product Descriptions (product title and specification to product description), and Wikihow (how-to questions and step-by-step guides).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, the model is prompted to generate the output directly. For the proposed method, the model is prompted to generate outputs with varying assertiveness and complexity using specific preambles.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used include MPT 30B Instruct, Falcon 40B Instruct, Command 6B, Command 52B, and Llama 2 13B Chat.
    Step 4: Annotation: Crowdworkers are asked to evaluate model outputs, marking each example with a binary yes or no to denote whether an error is present. Separately, a different set of annotators rate the overall quality of the same outputs from 1 to 5. Additionally, a third group of annotators rate the assertiveness and complexity of each output from 1 to 5.
    Step 5: Quality Control: Inter-annotator agreement is checked using Gwet’s AC1 measure. Distractor examples are included to act as attention checks.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: The authors fit a Lasso regression model to determine the degree to which each error type is captured by the overall scores. They also analyze the difference in annotated error rates for distractor examples and study the effect of assertiveness and complexity on human annotations. Finally, they offer preliminary evidence that using human feedback as a training objective disproportionately increases the assertiveness of model outputs.


paper 2:
Clinical Knowledge Mastery in LLMs:
  Title: Do Current Large Language Models Master Adequate Clinical Knowledge?
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising potential in solving clinical problems. However, it is unclear whether these models have mastered sufficient, comprehensive, and necessary medical knowledge to solve real clinical problems, such as clinical diagnostic assistance.
  Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs, including medical LLMs, are predominantly based on question-answering (QA) tasks. These benchmarks are limited in scope, covering only some common diseases and lacking extensive coverage of various knowledge aspects of diseases. Additionally, QA tasks assess a combination of skills (understanding the question, mastering relevant knowledge, and applying that knowledge for reasoning), which does not directly reflect the mastery of clinical knowledge. Therefore, a more comprehensive evaluation method is needed to assess the clinical knowledge mastery of LLMs.
  Proposed Method: The authors propose a framework to assess the mastery of LLMs in clinical knowledge. They construct a large medical disease-based knowledge base, MedDisK, covering 10,632 common diseases across 18 clinical knowledge aspects. They then introduce a MedDisK-based evaluation method, MedDisKEval, which prompts LLMs to retrieve information related to these clinical knowledge aspects. The LLM's mastery of medical knowledge is evaluated by measuring the similarity between the LLM-generated information and the content within the knowledge base.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Construct the MedDisK knowledge base, which includes 10,632 common diseases and 18 clinical knowledge aspects necessary for diagnosing and treating diseases.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For pretraining-only models, use few-shot learning with five demonstrative examples. For instruction-tuned models, craft tailored instructions for each knowledge aspect and add them before the few-shot examples. Example prompts include: 'The primary symptoms of virus URI are ...' and 'The anatomy parts of diabetes are ...'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate 12 general and medical LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo, Bloomz-7.1B-mt, LLaMa-7B, Vicuna-7B, ChatGLM-6B, Baichuan-7B, ChatDoctor, DoctorGLM, BenTsao, HuatuoGPT, BianQue-2, and PULSE.
    Step 4: Post-Process Responses: Apply heuristic rules to extract relevant segments and format responses according to three types of clinical knowledge aspects: enumerated type (list of entities), declarative type (unstructured text), and numeric type.
    Step 5: Evaluate Responses: Measure the similarity between LLM-generated information and the content within the knowledge base using automated metrics such as BLEU-1, ROUGE-1, and cosine similarity. Perform expert-aligned grading to categorize consistency scores into distinct levels: Completely Wrong, Partially Correct, and Basically Correct.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of medical LLMs with their backbone models. Perform a significance analysis to assess the differences in performance across various clinical knowledge aspects. Summarize the findings and provide insights for the advancement of medical LLMs.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important questions related to the evaluation and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Paper 1 focuses on the limitations of using human feedback as the gold standard for evaluating and training LLMs, while Paper 2 proposes a comprehensive framework to assess the mastery of clinical knowledge in LLMs.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses a critical issue in the current evaluation and training practices of LLMs
- Proposes a systematic approach to analyze the coverage of error types by overall preference scores
- Investigates the effect of confounders such as assertiveness and complexity on human annotations
- Offers preliminary evidence that using human feedback as a training objective may lead to undesirable biases in model outputs

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The datasets used (Curation Corpus, Amazon Product Descriptions, and Wikihow) may not be representative of the full range of tasks and domains where LLMs are applied
- The study does not propose an alternative evaluation or training method to address the limitations of human feedback

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Proposes a comprehensive framework (MedDisK) to assess the mastery of clinical knowledge in LLMs
- Constructs a large-scale knowledge base covering a wide range of diseases and clinical knowledge aspects
- Introduces a novel evaluation method (MedDisKEval) that directly assesses the mastery of clinical knowledge, rather than relying on question-answering tasks
- Evaluates a diverse set of general and medical LLMs, providing insights into their capabilities and limitations

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The study is limited to the medical domain and may not be directly applicable to other domains where LLMs are used
- The automated evaluation metrics (BLEU-1, ROUGE-1, and cosine similarity) may not fully capture the nuances and correctness of the generated responses

Comparison:
While both papers make valuable contributions, Paper 2 stands out as the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The proposed framework (MedDisK) and evaluation method (MedDisKEval) address a critical gap in the current evaluation practices of medical LLMs. The comprehensive knowledge base and the direct assessment of clinical knowledge mastery provide a more reliable and informative evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in the medical domain. In contrast, Paper 1, while addressing an important issue, does not propose a concrete solution to the limitations of human feedback in evaluation and training.

SuRe: Summarizing Retrievals using Answer Candidates for Open-domain QA of LLMs:
  Title: SuRe: Summarizing Retrievals using Answer Candidates for Open-domain QA of LLMs
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in various natural language processing tasks, including question answering (QA) tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as hallucinations and difficulty in integrating up-to-date knowledge. Incorporating new information with the retrieval of relevant passages is a promising way to improve QA with LLMs, but existing methods often require additional fine-tuning, which becomes infeasible with recent LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods for improving QA with LLMs often require additional fine-tuning, which is not feasible with recent LLMs due to their scale and the nature of black-box APIs. Augmenting retrieved passages via prompting has the potential to address this limitation, but this direction has been limitedly explored. The proposed method, SuRe, aims to enhance open-domain QA (ODQA) with LLMs by summarizing retrievals. SuRe helps LLMs predict more accurate answers for a given question, which are well-supported by the summarized retrieval that could be viewed as an explicit rationale extracted from the retrieved passages.
  Proposed Method: SuRe is a framework that enhances ODQA with LLMs by constructing summaries of the retrieved passages for each of the multiple answer candidates. SuRe confirms the most plausible answer from the candidate set by evaluating the validity and ranking of the generated summaries. The process involves: 1. Generating multiple answer candidates for a given question and retrieved passages. 2. Creating conditional summaries of the retrieved passages for each candidate. 3. Evaluating the validity and informativeness of these summaries to select the most plausible answer.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on four different ODQA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ), WebQuestions (WebQ), 2WikiMulti-hopQA (2Wiki), and HotpotQA. For NQ and WebQ, we use their original test splits and 21M English Wikipedia dump as the source passages for the retrieval. For 2Wiki and HotpotQA, we use the subsampled splits released by Trivedi et al. (2023), along with the corresponding corpus for each data.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Answer Candidates Generation: Below are N passages related to the question at the end. After reading the passages, provide two correct candidates for the answer to the question at the end. Each answer should be in the form: (a) xx, (b) yy, and should not exceed 3 words for each candidate.
      Conditional Summarization: Your job is to act as a professional writer. You will write a good-quality passage that can support the given prediction about the question only based on the information in the provided supporting passages. Now, let's start. After you write, please write [DONE] to indicate you are done. Do not write a prefix (e.g., 'Response:') while writing a passage.
      Instance-wise Validation: Question: {Question} Prediction: {Prediction} Passage: {Passage} Does the passage correctly support the prediction? Choices: [True, False]. Answer:
      Pair-wise Ranking: Question: Given the following passages, determine which one provides a more informative answer to the subsequent question. Passage 1: {Passage 1} Passage 2: {Passage 2} Target Question: {Question} Your Task: Identify which passage (Passage 1 or Passage 2) is more relevant and informative to answer the question at hand. Choices: [Passage 1, Passage 2]. Answer:
    Step 3: Select Models: We use three recent state-of-the-art LLMs: ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0301), GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613), and LLaMA2-chat-70B. For the retrieval methods, we use BM25, DPR-multi (DPR), and Contriever.
    Step 4: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks. Specifically, measure exact match (EM) and F1 score, and analyze the effectiveness of SuRe for improving the zero-shot ODQA performance of retrieval-augmented LLMs.

Lyfe Agents: generative agents for low-cost real-time social interactions:
  Title: Lyfe Agents: generative agents for low-cost real-time social interactions
  Problem Statement: Highly autonomous generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) promise to simulate intricate social behaviors in virtual societies. However, achieving real-time interactions with humans at a low computational cost remains challenging.
  Motivation: Existing methods for simulating human social behavior using LLMs, such as Language Model Powered Autonomous (LaMPA) agents, incur high computational and monetary costs due to their liberal use of LLM calls and autonomous nature. This makes them impractical for real-world applications, especially when simulating a mini society of social autonomous agents. The proposed method, Lyfe Agents, aims to address these challenges by drawing inspiration from the human brain, which is highly efficient in its processing. By adopting brain-inspired techniques, Lyfe Agents can reduce computational costs while maintaining high levels of intelligence and autonomy.
  Proposed Method: Lyfe Agents combine several innovative techniques to achieve low-cost, real-time responsiveness while remaining intelligent and goal-oriented. The key innovations include: (1) an option-action framework that reduces the cost of high-level decisions by allowing agents to commit to an option for an extended period, (2) asynchronous self-monitoring that maintains a summary of relevant recent events to improve self-consistency and goal adherence, and (3) a Summarize-and-Forget (SaF) memory mechanism that prioritizes critical memory items at a low cost by clustering and summarizing memories before storing them long-term.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Develop a custom 3D virtual environment platform called LyfeGame, which includes several multi-agent scenarios such as solving a murder mystery, deciding which school club to join, and securing medicine for a sick member.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each scenario, initialize agents with unique background stories, goals, and initial memories. For example, in the murder mystery scenario, agents are given specific memories and goals related to the crime.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-3.5 from OpenAI as the underlying LLM for generating agent responses and performing memory summarization.
    Step 4: Get Results: Run simulations in the LyfeGame environment and collect data on agent interactions, information dissemination, and task completion. For example, measure the success rate of agents identifying the murderer in the murder mystery scenario.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Lyfe Agents with and without the proposed techniques (option-action framework, self-monitoring, and SaF memory) through ablation studies. Evaluate metrics such as computational cost, response latency, and task success rates to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose interesting methods to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in different contexts. Paper 1 focuses on improving open-domain question answering (ODQA) by summarizing retrievals using answer candidates, while Paper 2 aims to create generative agents for low-cost, real-time social interactions in virtual environments.

- Develops a custom 3D virtual environment, LyfeGame, to evaluate the proposed method in various multi-agent scenarios.
- Plans to conduct ablation studies to determine the effectiveness of each proposed technique.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing methods, such as LaMPA agents, in terms of computational cost and performance.
- The scalability of the proposed method to larger virtual societies and more complex scenarios is not discussed.

Conclusion:
While both papers propose innovative methods, Paper 1 (SuRe) appears to be more suitable for acceptance at a top AI conference like ICLR or ACL. The strengths of Paper 1 lie in its clear problem statement, well-defined methodology, and thorough evaluation plan on established ODQA datasets. The proposed method directly addresses the limitations of existing approaches and has the potential to significantly improve the performance of LLMs in ODQA tasks.

In contrast, Paper 2 (Lyfe Agents) introduces an interesting concept but lacks a clear comparison with existing methods and does not provide sufficient details on the scalability of the proposed approach. While the brain-inspired techniques are innovative, the paper would benefit from a more rigorous evaluation plan and a discussion on the generalizability of the method to various virtual environments and scenarios.

paper 1:
Making Retrieval-Augmented Language Models Robust to Irrelevant Context:
  Title: Making Retrieval-Augmented Language Models Robust to Irrelevant Context
  Problem Statement: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) are designed to enhance language understanding systems by incorporating external information. However, these models can suffer from performance degradation when irrelevant information is retrieved, especially in multi-hop reasoning scenarios where irrelevant evidence can lead to cascading errors.
  Motivation: Existing methods for retrieval augmentation can sometimes negatively impact model performance due to the inclusion of irrelevant context. This is particularly problematic in multi-hop reasoning tasks where the model must integrate multiple pieces of evidence. The inspiration behind the proposed method is to ensure that retrieved information aids model performance when relevant and does not harm it when irrelevant. The proposed method aims to filter out irrelevant passages and fine-tune the model to handle noisy contexts effectively.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes two methods to mitigate the issue of irrelevant context in RALMs. The first method uses a natural language inference (NLI) model to filter out retrieved passages that do not entail the question-answer pairs. The second method involves fine-tuning the language model with a mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts to make it robust to noisy retrieval. This is achieved by automatically generating training data that includes both relevant and irrelevant contexts, and using this data to fine-tune the model.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on five open-domain question answering benchmarks: Natural Questions (NQ), 2WikiMQA, StrategyQA, Bamboogle, and Fermi. These datasets include both single-hop and multi-hop questions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the baseline, the model is prompted to generate answers without retrieval. For the proposed method, the model is prompted to generate answers with retrieved context, and an NLI model is used to filter out irrelevant contexts. Additionally, the model is fine-tuned with a mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts.
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments use Llama-2-13B and Llama-2-70B models. The NLI model used is a BART-Large model trained on the MNLI dataset.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the five QA benchmarks with different retrieval settings: no retrieval, top-1 retrieval, low-ranked retrieval, and random retrieval. Measure the accuracy of the models in each setting.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the models with and without retrieval, and with the NLI filtering and fine-tuning methods. Analyze the robustness of the models to irrelevant context and the overall improvement in performance.


paper 2:
Interpretable Word-Level Context-Based Sentiment Analysis:
  Title: Interpretable Word-Level Context-Based Sentiment Analysis
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of conducting interpretable word-level sentiment analysis (SA) using only document sentiment labels. The goal is to enhance interpretability at the word level while maintaining competitive performance at the document level.
  Motivation: Existing sentiment analysis models, especially those based on transformer architectures, are often criticized for being 'black boxes' due to their complex structures and lack of interpretability. These models typically focus on sentence-level or document-level analysis, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. The proposed method aims to provide greater transparency and interpretability by focusing on word-level sentiment analysis, which can offer a more granular understanding of how individual words contribute to the overall sentiment of a text.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Attention-based Multiple Instance Classification (AMIC), combines a straightforward modeling framework (multiple instance classification) with transformer components (self-attention and self-attention with relative position representations). The model is designed to provide interpretable outputs that include context weighting, indication of word neutrality, and negation handling. The architecture is transparent yet effective, allowing for competitive prediction performance while offering insights into the model's decision-making process.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The model is evaluated on two datasets: a wine review dataset and the Twitter Sentiment140 dataset. The wine review dataset consists of 141,409 reviews with ratings on a 100-point scale, while the Sentiment140 dataset contains 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive or negative based on emoticons.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: AMIC is built on a multiple instance classification framework and incorporates self-attention and self-attention with relative position representations. The model includes components for context-independent sentiment scores, global and local contextual dependencies, and sentiment word identification.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: The model is trained using gradient descent to minimize a binary cross-entropy loss function, along with three penalty terms to ensure the stability and interpretability of the sentiment scores. The training process involves a two-pass approach: the first pass focuses on updating the context-independent sentiment scores, while the second pass updates the parameters for global and local sentiment shifters and sentiment word indicators.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the model's performance on the test sets of both datasets. For the wine review dataset, use Glove-300-Wiki embeddings for word representations. For the Sentiment140 dataset, use word2vec embeddings to better capture the informal language of tweets.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of AMIC with other commonly used sentiment analysis methods, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, CNN, BiLSTM, and BERT. Analyze the model's ability to handle negation and other linguistic complexities through detailed examples from the datasets.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in their respective domains of natural language processing. Paper 1 focuses on improving the robustness of retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) to irrelevant context, while Paper 2 aims to enhance the interpretability of word-level sentiment analysis using only document-level sentiment labels.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses a critical issue in RALMs, which can suffer from performance degradation when irrelevant information is retrieved.
- Proposes two novel methods to mitigate the issue: an NLI-based filtering approach and fine-tuning with a mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts.
- Evaluates the proposed methods on a diverse set of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including both single-hop and multi-hop questions.
- Uses state-of-the-art language models (Llama-2-13B and Llama-2-70B) and a well-established NLI model (BART-Large) for the experiments.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The effectiveness of the proposed methods may depend on the quality of the NLI model used for filtering irrelevant contexts.
- The automatic generation of training data with relevant and irrelevant contexts may not always reflect real-world scenarios.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles the important problem of interpretability in sentiment analysis models, which are often criticized for being 'black boxes'.
- Proposes a novel method, AMIC, that combines multiple instance classification with transformer components to provide interpretable word-level sentiment analysis.
- Evaluates the model on two diverse datasets: a wine review dataset and the Twitter Sentiment140 dataset.
- Compares the performance of AMIC with several commonly used sentiment analysis methods, including both traditional and deep learning approaches.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The model's interpretability may come at the cost of slightly lower performance compared to more complex, less interpretable models like BERT.
- The two-pass training approach may be more computationally expensive than single-pass methods.

While both papers make valuable contributions, Paper 1 is likely to have a more significant impact on the field of natural language processing. The problem of irrelevant context in RALMs is a critical issue that can hinder the performance of language understanding systems in real-world applications. The proposed methods in Paper 1 offer practical solutions to this problem and are thoroughly evaluated on a diverse set of benchmarks. In contrast, while the interpretability of sentiment analysis models is important, the trade-off between interpretability and performance in Paper 2 may limit its practical applicability.

Controllable Text-to-Image Generation with Automatic Sketches:
  Title: Controllable Text-to-Image Generation with Automatic Sketches
  Problem Statement: Current text-to-image generation models often struggle to follow textual instructions, especially those requiring spatial reasoning. This limitation hinders the ability to generate images with precise control over object positions, sizes, and spatial arrangements based on textual descriptions.
  Motivation: Existing methods like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion often fail to generate images that accurately follow complex textual instructions, particularly those involving spatial relationships. These models either require extensive prompt engineering or manual sketch creation, which are inefficient and not easily generalizable. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown remarkable precision in generating code snippets for graphical sketches, suggesting a potential solution for enhancing the controllability of text-to-image generation models.
  Proposed Method: We introduce Control-GPT, a framework that leverages GPT-4 to generate programmatic sketches in TikZ code based on text prompts. These sketches serve as additional input conditions for diffusion-based text-to-image models like ControlNet. The process involves querying GPT-4 to generate TikZ code, converting the code into sketches, and using these sketches alongside text instructions to guide the image generation process. To address the lack of aligned text, images, and sketches datasets, we convert instance masks from existing datasets into polygon representations to mimic the sketches used at test time.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use the COCO dataset for images and captions, and the LVIS dataset for instance annotations. We construct a dataset of caption, image, and polygon sketch triplets by converting object masks from LVIS into polygon representations.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For querying GPT-4, we use prompts like: 'Draw a tv above a surfboard using TikZ without adding labels. The entire image should be inside a 5.12 *5.12 bounding box. First, you need to provide a step-by-step drawing guide. Then, you need to generate the code following the guide. Finally, summarize the drawing with: Summary of the drawing, {‘object name’: $OBJECT_NAME, ’position’: $(X, Y)} Make sure each object is separated and filled with red color.'
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT-4 for generating TikZ sketches and ControlNet as the base image generation model. ControlNet is fine-tuned with the constructed dataset of text, images, and polygon sketches.
    Step 4: Training Process: We fine-tune ControlNet with the constructed dataset. The stable diffusion blocks and text branch in ControlNet are frozen, while the control branch is fine-tuned with the control tokens, which include image tokens and grounding tokens. Grounding tokens are designed to associate sketches with object names and positions.
    Step 5: Get Results: Generate images using Control-GPT by feeding text prompts and GPT-4 generated TikZ sketches into the fine-tuned ControlNet. Evaluate the generated images on their ability to follow spatial relations, object positions, and sizes.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Control-GPT with baseline models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and other variants of ControlNet. Metrics include Unconditional Accuracy, Conditional Accuracy, Object Accuracy, and Visor Scores for spatial relations. Additionally, evaluate the model's ability to handle out-of-distribution prompts and generate complex scenes with multiple objects.

Remote Sensing Vision-Language Foundation Models without Annotations via Ground Remote Alignment:
  Title: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Foundation Models without Annotations via Ground Remote Alignment
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of training vision-language models (VLMs) for remote-sensing images without using any textual annotations. This problem is significant because remote-sensing images, unlike internet images, typically lack accompanying textual descriptions, making it difficult to apply existing VLM techniques that rely on large-scale text-image pairs.
  Motivation: Existing methods for training VLMs require large amounts of text-image pairs, which are readily available for internet images but not for remote-sensing images. Prior attempts to annotate satellite images with text are expensive and require expertise, resulting in much smaller datasets compared to those used for internet images. The proposed method leverages co-located internet imagery taken on the ground as an intermediary to connect remote-sensing images with language, thus sidestepping the need for direct textual annotations. This approach is expected to outperform existing supervised VLMs by utilizing a large amount of paired internet and satellite images for training.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, named GRAFT (Ground Remote Alignment for Training), involves training an image encoder for remote-sensing images to align with the image encoder of CLIP using a large dataset of paired internet and satellite images. The method includes two types of VLMs: image-level and pixel-level. The image-level model aligns satellite images with ground images using a contrastive loss, while the pixel-level model uses the precise geographical location of ground images to provide pixel-level supervision. The method also incorporates foundational models like SAM for segmentation and ViperGPT for visual question answering.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect two million-scale datasets of remotely-sensed images at different resolutions: 1m for NAIP and 10m for Sentinel-2 images. Collect ground images from Flickr with accurate geo-tags and sample satellite images centered at the geotags of the ground images.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For zero-shot classification and retrieval, use prompts such as 'A photo of a {label}', 'A photo taken from inside a {label}', and 'I took a photo from a {label}'. For baselines, use prompts like 'A centered satellite photo of {label}', 'A centered satellite photo of a {label}', and 'A centered satellite photo of the {label}'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 architectures initialized with CLIP's weights. Train the image-level model using a contrastive loss that aligns satellite images with ground images. Train the pixel-level model using a loss that aligns pixel representations with ground images based on their geographical locations.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the models on various benchmarks: EuroSAT and BigEarthNet for Sentinel-2 models, and SAT-4, SAT-6, and NAIP-OSM for NAIP models. Measure performance on zero-shot image classification, retrieval, and segmentation tasks. For segmentation, use SAM to refine the pixel-level model's predictions. For VQA, integrate the pixel-level model with ViperGPT and evaluate on the RSVQA benchmark.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of GRAFT models against existing VLMs trained with supervision and other foundation models. Analyze improvements in zero-shot classification, retrieval, segmentation, and VQA tasks. Conduct ablations to validate design choices, such as the importance of sampling in data collection and the use of images versus text for alignment.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- Relies on the performance of GPT-4 for generating accurate sketches
- May require significant computational resources for training and inference
- The effectiveness of the approach may depend on the quality of the constructed dataset

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles a unique challenge in the remote-sensing domain
- Proposes an innovative solution by aligning remote-sensing images with co-located internet imagery
- Utilizes a large dataset of paired internet and satellite images for training
- Incorporates foundational models like SAM and ViperGPT for downstream tasks
- Provides a comprehensive evaluation plan across various benchmarks and tasks

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The quality of the aligned representations may depend on the accuracy of geo-tags and the similarity between ground and satellite images
- The approach may not generalize well to areas with limited co-located internet imagery

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 2 appears to be the more promising and impactful contribution. The proposed method addresses a significant challenge in the remote-sensing domain and offers a novel solution by leveraging co-located internet imagery. The incorporation of foundational models and the comprehensive evaluation plan across various tasks demonstrate the potential for broad applicability and impact. While Paper 1 proposes an interesting approach to improve text-to-image generation, the reliance on GPT-4 and the potential limitations in dataset construction make it comparatively less compelling.

OctoPack: Instruction Tuning Code Large Language Models:
  Title: OctoPack: Instruction Tuning Code Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) on instructions has shown significant performance improvements on natural language tasks. However, there is a gap in applying instruction tuning specifically to the coding modality, leveraging the natural structure of Git commits, which pair code changes with human instructions. The problem is to improve the performance of LLMs on coding tasks by instruction tuning them using code-specific instructions.
  Motivation: Existing methods for instruction tuning LLMs on code rely on closed-source models from the OpenAI API to generate training data. This approach has several limitations: (1) closed-source APIs have unpredictable availability, (2) it assumes the existence of a more capable model, (3) it can reinforce model hallucination, and (4) it may violate OpenAI's terms of use, making such models non-permissive for commercial purposes. The proposed method aims to use permissively licensed data and avoid closed-source models to generate synthetic data, thereby creating a more reliable and commercially usable model.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves instruction tuning LLMs on a new dataset called CommitPack, which consists of 4 terabytes of Git commits across 350 programming languages. The method benchmarks CommitPack against other natural and synthetic code instructions on the 16B parameter StarCoder model. Additionally, a new benchmark called HumanEvalPack is introduced, expanding the HumanEval benchmark to include three coding tasks (Code Repair, Code Explanation, Code Synthesis) across six languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, Rust). The models, OctoCoder and OctoGeeX, are trained using this data and achieve state-of-the-art performance among permissive models.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Compile CommitPack, a dataset of 4 terabytes of Git commits across 350 programming languages. Filter this dataset to create CommitPackFT, a 2GB high-quality subset. Additionally, create HumanEvalPack, a benchmark covering three coding tasks (Code Repair, Code Explanation, Code Synthesis) across six programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, Rust).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each coding task in HumanEvalPack, construct prompts that guide the model to perform the task. For example, for Code Repair, provide an incorrect code function with a subtle bug and accompanying unit tests, and ask the model to fix the function. For Code Explanation, provide a correct code function and ask the model to generate a natural language explanation. For Code Synthesis, provide a natural language description of the desired code and ask the model to generate the code.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the 16B parameter StarCoder model as the base model for instruction tuning. Additionally, use the 6B parameter CodeGeeX2 model to create OctoGeeX.
    Step 4: Instruction Tuning: Instruction tune the StarCoder model on different combinations of instruction datasets, including CommitPackFT, OASST, xP3x, and Self-Instruct. Evaluate the performance of these models on the Python subset of HumanEvalPack to determine the best combination of datasets. The final model, OctoCoder, is created by instruction tuning StarCoder on CommitPackFT mixed with OASST data.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of OctoCoder and OctoGeeX on HumanEvalPack across all three coding tasks and six programming languages. Use the pass@1 metric to measure the likelihood that the model solves a problem in a single attempt.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of OctoCoder and OctoGeeX with other state-of-the-art Code LLMs, including non-permissive models like GPT-4 and WizardCoder. Analyze the performance across different languages and tasks to identify strengths and weaknesses. Investigate the impact of pretraining weight on programming language performance after instruction tuning.

Apollo: Zero-shot MultiModal Reasoning with Multiple Experts:
  Title: Apollo: Zero-shot MultiModal Reasoning with Multiple Experts
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of performing complex, multi-modal tasks using the expertise of different foundation models across various modalities and domains without relying on prompt engineering or tailor-made multi-modal training. This problem is significant because it aims to leverage the strengths of multiple pre-trained models to handle tasks that require understanding and reasoning over heterogeneous data, which is a common scenario in real-world applications.
  Motivation: Existing methods for multi-modal tasks often require expensive paired input-output data, semi-supervised task-specific data, or prompt engineering, which can be costly and time-consuming. Socratic models, which use language as an intermediate representation, heavily rely on large language models and prompt engineering, which may not be optimal for tasks that do not involve language. The proposed method, inspired by the collaborative nature of the Apollo program, aims to share knowledge between pre-trained transformer components through a common latent space, allowing for decentralized command execution and enabling each model to contribute and benefit from the expertise of others. This approach is expected to outperform existing baselines by avoiding the need for additional training or tuning steps.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, named APOLLO, leverages the expertise of multiple pre-trained transformer models across different modalities (e.g., audio, vision) by sharing knowledge through a common latent space. The method involves gradient updating of a combined loss at inference time, allowing the model to perform new tasks in a zero-shot setup. The framework includes two main guidance approaches: Experts-Summation and Experts-Product, which are used to align the predictions of multiple experts. Additionally, a hierarchical optimization process, termed Decentralization of Guidance Efforts, is introduced to enhance interaction between experts.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments are conducted on two tasks: stylized image captioning using the SentiCap and FlickrStyle10K datasets, and a novel task of audio-aware image captioning using a test set of 50 images from SentiCap with added audio clips of children's laughter.
    Step 2: Select Models: The models used include GPT-2 for language generation, CLIP for image-text alignment, roBERTa for sentiment classification, and DeepMoji for emotional style classification. For the audio-aware image captioning task, CLAP is used to assess text-audio correspondence.
    Step 3: Implement Guidance Approaches:
      Experts-Summation: Calculate the probabilities of the next token using GPT-2, CLIP, and style models. Compute a weighted sum of cross-entropy losses between the GPT-2 probability and the probabilities from CLIP and style models.
      Experts-Product: Calculate the probabilities of the next token using GPT-2, CLIP, and style models. Compute the loss as the cross-entropy between the product of CLIP and style probabilities with the GPT-2 probability, along with a regularization term.
      Decentralization of Guidance Efforts: Optimize CLIP's image embedding to be more style-oriented by computing a target probability as the product of the style expert probability and CLIP's initial probability. Apply gradient steps to optimize CLIP's image embedding and incorporate it into the loss function.
    Step 4: Optimize Models: For each generated token, perform T optimization steps to update the context vector of GPT-2. Calculate alternative probabilities for the next token using the experts and compute the guidance loss. Update the context vector by applying a single gradient step. Repeat this process for each generated token until the captioning process is complete.
    Step 5: Evaluate Results:
      Stylized Image Captioning: Evaluate the generated captions on fluency, text-image correspondence (TIC), and style accuracy using metrics such as GPT-2 perplexity, CLIPScore, and pre-trained models for style classification.
      Audio-Aware Image Captioning: Evaluate the generated captions on text-audio correspondence (TAC), text-image correspondence (TIC), and fluency using CLAP for text-audio correspondence and the same metrics as for stylized image captioning.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed APOLLO-based methods (APOLLO-CAP, APOLLO-CAP-P, APOLLO-CAP-PD) with baselines such as CapDec and ZeroCap. Analyze the trade-offs between TIC, style accuracy, and fluency. Provide qualitative examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. The OctoPack paper focuses on improving the performance of code LLMs through instruction tuning using a new dataset called CommitPack and introduces a new benchmark called HumanEvalPack. The Apollo paper, on the other hand, proposes a novel approach for zero-shot multi-modal reasoning by leveraging the expertise of multiple pre-trained transformer models across different modalities.

Strengths of OctoPack:
1. Addresses the gap in applying instruction tuning to code LLMs using code-specific instructions.
2. Uses permissively licensed data and avoids closed-source models, making the resulting models more reliable and commercially usable.
3. Introduces a new benchmark, HumanEvalPack, which covers three coding tasks across six programming languages.
4. Achieves state-of-the-art performance among permissive models on the HumanEvalPack benchmark.

Weaknesses of OctoPack:
1. Focuses primarily on coding tasks and may not generalize well to other domains.
2. The impact of the proposed method on real-world coding applications is not extensively discussed.

Strengths of Apollo:
1. Proposes a novel approach for zero-shot multi-modal reasoning without relying on expensive paired input-output data or prompt engineering.
2. Leverages the expertise of multiple pre-trained transformer models across different modalities by sharing knowledge through a common latent space.
3. Introduces a hierarchical optimization process to enhance interaction between experts.
4. Demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on two tasks: stylized image captioning and audio-aware image captioning.

Weaknesses of Apollo:
1. The evaluation is limited to two specific tasks, and the generalizability of the approach to other multi-modal tasks is not extensively explored.
2. The computational cost and scalability of the proposed method, which involves gradient updating at inference time, are not thoroughly discussed.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, the Apollo paper appears to be more innovative and impactful. The proposed method addresses a significant challenge in multi-modal reasoning and offers a novel solution that leverages the expertise of multiple pre-trained models without requiring additional training or tuning steps. The approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of multi-modal tasks beyond the two evaluated in the paper. In contrast, while the OctoPack paper makes valuable contributions to the field of code LLMs, its focus is more narrow, and the impact on real-world coding applications is less clear.

Language as Kernels:
  Title: Language as Kernels
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in natural language understanding tasks, but their computational resource requirements make them inaccessible in resource-constrained environments. The challenge is to harness the potential of LLMs without the need for high-performance computing resources.
  Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on computationally expensive LLMs, which are not feasible for use in distributed environments with limited resources. The inspiration behind the new method is to leverage the computational efficiency of kernel machines, which are known for their versatility and thriftiness. The proposed method aims to combine the strengths of LLMs and kernel machines to achieve high performance in language understanding tasks without the need for extensive computational resources.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces the Support Vector Generation (SVG) approach, which combines the generative capabilities of pre-trained LLMs with the computational efficiency of kernel machines. The method involves generating support vectors from LLMs and using them to form decision boundaries for classification tasks. This approach allows for zero-shot learning without the need for fine-tuning or high-performance computing resources.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate the proposed method on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, which includes tasks such as SST-2, CoLA, QQP, MRPC, RTE, QNLI, and MNLI.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the baseline, we use conventional prompting techniques. For the proposed method, we generate initial samples using a mid-size completion model (text-curie-001) and refine them using the SVG algorithm. Example prompts include generating positive and negative sentiment sentences for SST-2.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use OpenAI's GPT-3 models (text-davinci-003 for initial sampling and text-curie-001 for MCMC) for generating support vectors. The kernel machine used is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) implemented with libsvm.
    Step 4: Get Results: Run the experiments on CPU-only virtual machines and measure the performance of the proposed method on the GLUE benchmark tasks. Record the accuracy and F1 scores for each task.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method (SVG) with the baseline methods. Analyze the results to determine if SVG improves the performance of zero-shot learning tasks in resource-constrained environments. Discuss the computational efficiency and effectiveness of the method.

SCHEMA: State CHangEs MAtter for Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos:
  Title: SCHEMA: State CHangEs MAtter for Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos
  Problem Statement: The problem addressed in this paper is procedure planning in instructional videos, which involves creating a goal-oriented sequence of action steps given partial visual state observations. This problem is interesting and important because it aims to learn a structured and plannable state and action space, which is crucial for embodied AI systems in real-world applications like robotic navigation and task automation.
  Motivation: Existing methods for procedure planning have primarily focused on sequence modeling of steps with only sequence-level annotations, overlooking the roles of states in the procedures. This approach fails to comprehensively represent the state information, which is essential for understanding the causal relations between steps and states. The proposed method, SCHEMA, aims to establish a more structured state space by explicitly representing each step as state changes and tracking these changes. By leveraging the commonsense knowledge in large language models (LLMs) and aligning visual state observations with language state descriptions, SCHEMA is expected to achieve better performance and provide more explainable visualizations compared to existing baselines.
  Proposed Method: The SCHEMA method works by representing each step as state changes and tracking these changes in procedures. The key components are: 1) Step Representation: Using LLMs to describe the state changes of steps via chain-of-thought prompting. 2) State Changes Tracking: Aligning visual state observations with language state descriptions via cross-modal contrastive learning. 3) Mid-State Prediction: Predicting intermediate states using a non-autoregressive Transformer model. 4) Step Prediction: Predicting the step sequence given the full states using another Transformer model. The method involves training the model with a combination of state space learning, masked state modeling, and masked step modeling.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the CrossTask, COIN, and NIV benchmark datasets. CrossTask consists of 2,750 videos from 18 tasks, COIN contains 11,827 videos from 180 tasks, and NIV includes 150 videos.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For generating state descriptions, use chain-of-thought prompting with LLMs. Example prompt: 'First, describe the details of [step] for [goal] with one verb. Second, use 3 sentences to describe the status changes of objects before and after [step], avoiding using [verb].' Provide several examples as context.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the S3D network pretrained on the HowTo100M dataset as the visual encoder. Use GPT-3.5 for generating state descriptions. The state and step decoders are non-autoregressive Transformer models with self-attention and cross-attention modules.
    Step 4: Train the Model: Train the model with Adam optimizer, an initial learning rate of 5×10−3, decayed by 0.65 every 40 epochs. The batch size is 256. The training process involves three parts: state space learning, masked state modeling, and masked step modeling. Use cross-modal contrastive learning to align visual observations with language descriptions.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the model on the CrossTask, COIN, and NIV datasets using metrics such as Success Rate (SR), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of SCHEMA with existing methods like PlaTe, Ext-GAIL, P3IV, and EGPP. Analyze the improvements in SR, mAcc, and mIoU. Conduct ablation studies to verify the impact of state alignment and mid-state prediction. Provide qualitative results to illustrate state justifications and explainability.

EQA-MX: Embodied Question Answering using Multimodal Expression:
  Title: EQA-MX: Embodied Question Answering using Multimodal Expression
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of embodied question answering (EQA) that involves complex reasoning of multimodal expressions, including verbal utterances and nonverbal gestures. Traditional QA tasks have been explored in non-embodied settings, where questions contain only verbal utterances from a single verbal and visual perspective. This limitation hinders the development of models that can comprehend questions in natural human interactions, which often involve both verbal and nonverbal cues.
  Motivation: Existing methods for QA tasks focus solely on verbal questions and single visual perspectives, which do not align with natural human interactions that involve multimodal expressions. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to create a dataset and model that can handle the complexity of multimodal expressions, thereby improving the comprehension of embodied questions. The proposed method, VQ-Fusion, is expected to work better than existing baselines by learning salient multimodal representations from discrete verbal embeddings and continuous visual representations, thus addressing the structural mismatch in existing models.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves the creation of a novel large-scale dataset, EQA-MX, with over 8 million diverse embodied QA data samples involving multimodal expressions from multiple visual and verbal perspectives. To learn salient multimodal representations, the paper proposes a vector-quantization (VQ) based multimodal representation learning model, VQ-Fusion. VQ-Fusion extracts visual representations from multiple views and verbal questions, discretizes the visual representations using shared codebooks, and fuses these with discrete verbal representations to produce task representations. The model is trained using a combination of task learning loss and VQ loss to align multiview representations and learn unified concepts across multiple views.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The dataset used is EQA-MX, which contains 8,243,893 samples across 8 EQA tasks. The dataset includes multimodal expressions from various verbal and visual perspectives to reduce perspective bias and enhance model generalizability.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each EQA task, construct prompts that include both verbal utterances and nonverbal gestures. For example, for the Object Grounding task, the prompt could be 'What is the name of that object?' accompanied by a pointing gesture towards the object.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used include state-of-the-art visual-language models such as Dual-Encoder (ViT+BERT), CLIP, VisualBERT, and ViLT. These models are extended to learn multiview representations and are incorporated with VQ-Fusion for improved performance.
    Step 4: Train Models: Train the models using the EQA-MX dataset. Use the Adam optimizer with weight decay regularization and cosine annealing warm restarts. Train the models for 8 epochs with a batch size of 128. Use shared codebooks in VQ-Fusion to discretize and align visual representations with verbal representations.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the EQA-MX dataset using macro-accuracy across all tasks to gauge the effectiveness of the models in comprehending EQA tasks. Compare the performance of models with and without VQ-Fusion.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine the impact of VQ-Fusion on the performance of EQA tasks. Compare the performance improvements across different tasks and discuss the significance of using multimodal expressions and multiple visual perspectives in learning EQA tasks.

Privacy Preserving API Fine-tuning for LLMs:
  Title: Privacy Preserving API Fine-tuning for LLMs
  Problem Statement: As deep learning models become larger and more expensive, many practitioners turn to fine-tuning APIs. These web services allow fine-tuning a model between two parties: the client that provides the data, and the server that hosts the model. While convenient, the fine-tuning APIs raise a new concern: the data of the client is at risk of privacy breach during the training procedure. This challenge presents an important practical case of vertical federated learning, where the two parties perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large pre-trained model.
  Motivation: Existing methods for fine-tuning large models often require sharing sensitive data with the server, which poses a significant privacy risk. Traditional federated learning approaches do not adequately address the privacy concerns specific to fine-tuning APIs. The proposed method, P3EFT, leverages the properties of parameter-efficient fine-tuning to maintain privacy with a lower performance overhead. This method is expected to work better than existing baselines by obfuscating gradients and activations, thus preventing label leakage while maintaining high accuracy.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, P3EFT, is a two-party split learning algorithm designed to keep the client's labels private during the fine-tuning process. The method involves the following key steps: 1) Analyzing the privacy of popular PEFT algorithms, 2) Proposing a private backpropagation protocol that obfuscates gradients, 3) Using multiple sets of adapters and randomized mixing weights to obfuscate activations, and 4) Applying an adversarial regularizer to ensure that individual adapters do not leak labels. The method is validated by fine-tuning DeBERTa-v2-XXLarge and Flan-T5 using LoRA adapters on common NLP tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on the SST-2 dataset for sentiment classification and the MRPC dataset for paraphrase identification, both part of the GLUE benchmark.
    Step 2: Select Models: We use DeBERTa-v2-XXLarge and Flan-T5-Large pre-trained models. LoRA adapters with rank 8 are used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
    Step 3: Implement Privacy-Preserving Backpropagation: Implement the private backpropagation protocol by generating noise vectors and splitting the gradient computation across multiple servers. Ensure that the noise variance is set to a high value (e.g., 1000) to obfuscate the gradients effectively.
    Step 4: Train Multiple Adapters: Initialize multiple sets of adapters (e.g., n=2) and use randomized mixing weights to combine their outputs. Ensure that the initial activations are equal to the mean of the individual adapter activations.
    Step 5: Apply Adversarial Regularizer: During each training step, fit linear 'heads' to predict labels from individual adapter activations and perform an adversarial update to prevent the 'heads' from predicting the labels.
    Step 6: Fine-tune Models: Fine-tune the models on the SST-2 and MRPC datasets using the P3EFT protocol. Track the learning curves and ensure that the privacy-preserving mechanisms do not affect the training dynamics.
    Step 7: Evaluate Privacy and Performance: Evaluate the privacy of the gradients and activations using clustering and classification attacks. Measure the task-specific metrics (Accuracy for SST-2 and F1 for MRPC) and compare them with baselines such as Distance Correlation (DC) and training without LoRA adapters.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of P3EFT with existing privacy-preserving methods and baselines. Assess the trade-offs between privacy and accuracy, and conduct sensitivity experiments to explore different regularizer coefficients.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 2 appears to be the more likely candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The privacy concerns addressed in Paper 2 are highly relevant and timely, given the increasing use of fine-tuning APIs for large language models. The proposed method, P3EFT, offers a novel solution to maintain privacy while minimizing the performance overhead. Additionally, the comprehensive experiment plan demonstrates the authors' commitment to rigorously evaluating the effectiveness of their method.

While Paper 1 also presents a novel approach to embodied question answering, the complexity of the proposed method and the potential biases in the dataset may raise concerns among reviewers. Furthermore, the privacy issues addressed in Paper 2 are likely to be of greater interest to the AI community at present.

Peering Through Preferences:
  Title: Peering Through Preferences: Unraveling Feedback Acquisition for Aligning Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intents critically involves the use of human or AI feedback. The problem lies in the structural design choice between sparse feedback protocols: ratings (e.g., score Response A on a scale of 1-7) and rankings (e.g., is Response A better than Response B?). The paper addresses the inconsistency problem wherein preferences inferred from ratings and rankings significantly disagree, affecting the alignment and evaluation of LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods primarily focus on dense feedback annotations, which are expensive to acquire and integrate. Sparse feedback protocols, while easier to acquire, present a structural design choice that has not been thoroughly explored. The inconsistency between ratings and rankings feedback protocols can lead to significant variations in the alignment and evaluation of LLMs. Understanding this inconsistency is crucial for improving the real-world utility of LLMs.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes an analysis of the effect of ratings and rankings feedback protocols on the alignment and evaluation of LLMs. The method involves collecting ratings and rankings feedback from both human and AI annotators, transforming ratings into rankings, and training reward models on these feedback data. The impact of these protocols is then evaluated using a Best-of-n policy to select the best response from a set of candidate responses generated by the base LLM.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect 5.2K instructions from varied sources such as Dolly, User-orient, and SuperNI. Use Alpaca-7B as the base LLM to generate five candidate responses for each instruction.
    Step 2: Collect Feedback:
      Ratings Feedback: Prompt GPT-3.5-Turbo to assign a score between 1-7 to individual candidate responses based on accuracy, coherence, and harmlessness. Collect 24.6K instances of ratings feedback.
      Rankings Feedback: Prompt GPT-3.5-Turbo to provide pairwise ranking preferences for the same responses. Collect 46.5K unique instances of rankings feedback.
    Step 3: Human Feedback Collection: Collect 6K instances of annotations from human annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk. This includes 4K ratings and 2K pairwise rankings feedback.
    Step 4: Analyze Feedback Data:
      Ratings Distribution: Analyze the score distribution for ratings data from human and AI annotations.
      Bias Analysis: Assess whether the length or number of unique words in the candidate responses bias the ratings and rankings feedback judgments.
      Agreement Analysis: Conduct an agreement analysis comparing the assessments provided by human-human and human-AI annotators for both ratings and rankings feedback.
    Step 5: Train Reward Models:
      Regression Reward Model: Train a regression model on the ratings feedback data using a normalized score between 0-1.
      NLL Reward Model: Train a reward model on the pairwise feedback data using the negative log-likelihood objective.
    Step 6: Best-of-n Policy: Use the trained reward models to select the best response from a set of n candidate responses generated by the base LLM. Evaluate the quality of the Best-of-n policies by comparing their responses against a reference model.
    Step 7: Evaluate Models:
      Evaluation Protocols: Evaluate the models on 553 unseen instructions using both ratings and rankings feedback protocols. Compute the win-rate of the base LLM and the Best-of-n policies against DaVinci-003.
      Human and AI Evaluators: Use both human annotators and GPT-3.5-Turbo to provide ratings and rankings feedback for the evaluation.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the win-rates and identify the evaluation inconsistency phenomenon where the choice of the feedback protocol during evaluation favors the alignment algorithm that uses the same feedback protocol.

Democratized Diffusion Language Model:
  Title: Democratized Diffusion Language Model
  Problem Statement: Diffusion Models are a promising avenue for text generation, offering a multitude of frameworks for researchers and practitioners alike. However, these frameworks differ significantly in how they utilize Diffusion Models for categorical data generation, making it challenging to compare their performance and understand their differences. This paper aims to address this issue by examining various Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) and proposing a methodology to evaluate them effectively.
  Motivation: Existing methods for comparing Diffusion Language Models primarily focus on the quality metrics of generated samples, which do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences between these models. Additionally, the unique diffusion frameworks of each model make direct comparisons difficult. The proposed methodology aims to address these challenges by focusing on the changes that occur in the samples during the diffusion generation process. This approach is expected to provide a more nuanced understanding of the models' performance and capabilities.
  Proposed Method: The paper introduces the Democratized Diffusion Language Model (DDLM), a re-implementation of the Diffusion LM trained with the CDCD framework. The key contributions include: 1) Releasing the DDLM to promote further research in Diffusion Models for text generation. 2) Demonstrating that most DLMs can halt the generation process early, enabling faster sample generation without compromising quality. 3) Introducing and evaluating three adaptive early exiting criteria inspired by text classification methods. 4) Providing empirical evidence of the efficiency of these criteria in enhancing text generation.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The primary dataset used for training and evaluation is the C4 dataset. The evaluation involves generating text samples in both Unconditional and Prefix-32 setups.
    Step 2: Model Training:
      Architecture: The DDLM is implemented as a Transformer model with 8 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden size of 1024. The sequence length is set to 64 tokens.
      Training Objectives: The model is trained using the score interpolation objective with a cross-entropy loss function. The embeddings are normalized to prevent uncontrolled growth.
      Noise Masking Strategies: Three noise masking strategies are evaluated: MLM masking, prefix masking, and span masking. The best-performing strategy is selected based on AR-NLL and other metrics.
      Time Warping: Time warping is applied to shape the noise schedule during training.
    Step 3: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 4: Select Models: The models compared include DDLM, SSD, Plaid, GPT-2, and GPT-Neo. The evaluation involves generating text samples and comparing them using various metrics.
    Step 5: Get Results:
      Metrics: The evaluation metrics include AR-NLL, MAUVE, average distinct N-grams, and Zipf’s coefficient. These metrics cover various properties of the generated texts.
      Evaluation Setup: The evaluation is conducted in two setups: Unconditional and Prefix-32. The models are evaluated at different generation steps to understand the sample dynamics.
    Step 6: Analyze Results:
      Early Exiting Criteria: Three adaptive early exiting criteria are evaluated: Entropy criterion, Patience-based criterion, and KL criterion. The performance of these criteria is compared to a fixed early exiting strategy.
      Sample Dynamics: The Word Error Rate (WER) score is used to analyze the convergence of samples during generation. The results are compared to understand the effectiveness of early exiting methods.

Video Language Planning:
  Title: Video Language Planning
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of enabling visual planning for complex long-horizon tasks in the space of generated videos and language. This involves creating detailed multimodal plans that can guide robots to complete tasks over extended periods.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), are limited in their ability to generate feasible plans that respect physical constraints and dynamics. LLMs struggle with grounding and reasoning over shapes, physics, and real-world constraints, while VLMs are predominantly trained on static image datasets and fail to reason over dynamics. Text-to-video models, although capable of predicting short-term dynamics, have not been effectively applied to long-horizon planning. The proposed method aims to combine the strengths of VLMs and text-to-video models to generate coherent and feasible long-horizon video plans.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Video Language Planning (VLP), integrates vision-language models and text-to-video models to enable long-horizon visual planning. VLP uses a tree search procedure where VLMs serve as policies and value functions, and text-to-video models act as dynamics models. The process involves: (i) using the VLM to generate possible next-step text actions, (ii) employing the video model to simulate future image sequences for each action, and (iii) using the VLM as a heuristic function to evaluate the favorability of each rollout. This iterative process continues until a long-horizon video plan is synthesized. The generated video plans can then be translated into real robot actions via goal-conditioned policies.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments use datasets from various robotics domains, including multi-object rearrangement and multi-camera bi-arm dexterous manipulation. Specific datasets include the Language Table environment, RT-1 dataset, and a custom dataset for 14DoF bi-manual manipulation.
    Step 2: Model Training:
      Video Models: Train text-conditioned video generation models at multiple resolutions (24×40, 48×80, 192×320) using a base channel width of 256. Train the base model for 3 days and superresolution models for 1 day using 64 TPUv3 pods.
      VLM Models: Fine-tune a 12B PaLM-E model to predict heuristic values and policies using 64 TPUv3 pods for 1 day.
      Goal-Conditioned Policy: Train a goal-conditioned policy using the LA V A model architecture, replacing the text-encoder with a ResNet encoder for the goal image. Train for 1 day using 16 TPUv3 pods.
    Step 3: Planning and Execution:
      Language Table: Plan with a horizon of 16, beam width of 2, language branching factor of 4, and video branching factor of 4. Use DDIM sampler with 64 timesteps for base resolution and 4 timesteps for higher resolution, with a guidance scale of 5. Generate 16 videos in parallel using a 4 TPU inference pod.
      7DoF Mobile Manipulator: Use PaLM-E to generate scene captions and few-shot prompt PaLM to generate plans. Use a beam width of 3 and a video diffusion model with different resolutions (64×80, 256×320).
      14DoF Bi-Manual Manipulation: Follow the same planning setup as in Language Table with a heuristic function clipped threshold of 15.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate video plans and execute them in both simulated and real environments. Evaluate the success of synthesized video plans and execution performance on tasks such as moving blocks, grouping by color, and making lines.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of VLP with baselines such as UniPi, LA V A, RT-2, and PaLM-E. Assess the quality of generated video plans, task completion rates, and generalization capabilities to new objects and lighting conditions.

Revealing The Intrinsic Ability of Generative Text Summarizers for Outlier Paragraph Detection:
  Title: Revealing The Intrinsic Ability of Generative Text Summarizers for Outlier Paragraph Detection
  Problem Statement: Generative text summarizers are proficient at content encapsulation but struggle when outlier paragraphs disrupt the primary narrative. These outliers can be categorized into cross-document outliers, which are thematically inconsistent but within the same domain, and cross-domain outliers, originating from distinct domains. The challenge is to detect these outliers effectively to maintain the integrity and quality of the generated summaries.
  Motivation: Traditional methods for outlier detection rely heavily on word embeddings and specialized classifiers, which require extensive supervised fine-tuning. Confidence-based strategies, although bypassing fine-tuning, are not well-suited for summarization tasks due to their non-classification nature. The proposed method leverages the encoder-decoder cross-attention framework, focusing on the unique characteristics of infrequent words for detection. This approach is expected to outperform existing baselines by utilizing cross-attention scores and word frequency normalization, which are more aligned with the summarization task.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces CODE (Cross-Attention Outlier Detector), which uses a closed-form expression based on cross-attention scores to detect outlier paragraphs. The method involves pre-training text summarizers with cross-document outliers and then using the cross-attention scores to identify outliers. The core contributions include: (1) a method to pre-train summarizers with cross-document outliers, (2) the CODE detector that computes average cross-attention scores normalized by word occurrences, and (3) data pipelines to create pre-training and detection datasets.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Four pre-training datasets are used: CNN/Daily Mail, SAMSum, Delve, and S2orc. These datasets are transformed to include cross-document outliers. Additionally, cross-document and cross-domain outlier detection datasets are created from these sources.
    Step 2: Data Construction Pipeline: For pre-training, coherent paragraphs are split and outlier paragraphs are injected. For outlier detection, coherent and outlier paragraphs are sampled from the same or different domains. Each dataset contains two coherent paragraphs and two outlier paragraphs per sample.
    Step 3: Pre-train Summarizers: Use Hugging Face Transformers and AdamW optimizer with default parameters. Pre-train BART-Base, BART-Large, T5-Base, and T5-Large models on the pre-training datasets. Select the checkpoint with the lowest evaluation loss for outlier detection.
    Step 4: Implement Baselines: Two baselines are used: Frozen and FT-ALL. Frozen uses a multi-layer perceptron with frozen GLM parameters, while FT-ALL fine-tunes all parameters. Both baselines are trained with the AdamW optimizer and evaluated on the same datasets.
    Step 5: Apply CODE: For each paragraph, calculate the relevance score using cross-attention scores and word frequency normalization. Determine if a paragraph is an outlier based on a threshold. Hyper-parameters α and β are tuned to minimize FPR at 95% TPR.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the performance of CODE and baselines on cross-document and cross-domain outlier detection datasets using metrics such as FPR at 95% TPR, AUROC, and AUPR. Analyze the impact of pre-training checkpoints, attention layers, and dataset similarity on detection performance.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and propose novel methods to tackle them. However, there are notable differences in the scope, methodology, and potential impact of the two projects.

Paper 1, "Video Language Planning," presents a novel approach to enable long-horizon visual planning by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-video models. The proposed method, VLP, aims to generate coherent and feasible video plans that can guide robots in completing complex tasks over extended periods. The motivation is clear, as existing methods struggle with grounding, reasoning over dynamics, and generating feasible plans. The proposed tree search procedure, which combines the strengths of VLMs and text-to-video models, is well-structured and innovative. The step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive, covering dataset gathering, model training, planning and execution, and result analysis. The evaluation across various robotics domains and comparison with baselines demonstrate the thoroughness of the approach.

Paper 2, "Revealing The Intrinsic Ability of Generative Text Summarizers for Outlier Paragraph Detection," focuses on the problem of detecting outlier paragraphs that disrupt the primary narrative in generative text summarization. The proposed method, CODE (Cross-Attention Outlier Detector), leverages the encoder-decoder cross-attention framework and word frequency normalization to identify outliers. The motivation is valid, as traditional methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning or are not well-suited for summarization tasks. The proposed method is novel in its approach to pre-train summarizers with cross-document outliers and use cross-attention scores for detection. The experiment plan is well-structured, including dataset gathering, data construction pipeline, pre-training summarizers, implementing baselines, and evaluating performance.

While both papers present innovative methods, Paper 1 has a broader scope and potential for real-world impact. The integration of VLMs and text-to-video models to enable long-horizon visual planning is a significant advancement in robotics and AI. The ability to generate coherent and feasible video plans that can guide robots in complex tasks has numerous applications in various domains. The comprehensive experiment plan and evaluation across multiple robotics datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.

In comparison, Paper 2 addresses a more specific problem within the domain of generative text summarization. While outlier paragraph detection is important for maintaining the quality of generated summaries, the impact is relatively limited compared to the broader implications of video language planning in robotics and AI.

Considering the novelty, potential impact, and thoroughness of the proposed methods and experiment plans, Paper 1 "Video Language Planning" appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.

paper 1:
Fusion Token: Enhancing Compression and Efficiency in Language Model Tokenization:
  Title: Fusion Token: Enhancing Compression and Efficiency in Language Model Tokenization
  Problem Statement: Language model training requires substantial computational resources, and efficient data encoding is crucial for optimizing this process. Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a well-established method, but there is a need for more efficient tokenization techniques that can further enhance compression rates and reduce computational costs.
  Motivation: While BPE balances computational efficiency and linguistic expressiveness, it is limited by its bi-gram merging strategy. As language models grow in size and complexity, the computational resources required for training also increase. The proposed Fusion Token method aims to address these limitations by employing a more aggressive tokenization strategy that can significantly improve compression rates and reduce inference times. By expanding token groups from bi-grams to 10-grams, Fusion Token can achieve higher compression rates with fewer tokens, making it more efficient than traditional BPE.
  Proposed Method: Fusion Token enhances the conventional BPE approach by allowing the merging of general n-grams (up to 10-grams) instead of just bi-grams. The method involves adding 1024 tokens to the vocabulary, which significantly improves the compression rate compared to a regular BPE tokenizer with a much larger vocabulary. The process starts with an existing BPE vocabulary and iteratively groups tokens based on their occurrence probabilities. The highest probability n-grams are added to the vocabulary, and this process is repeated until the desired number of additional tokens is reached. During inference, fusion tokens are prioritized over regular tokens, leading to faster tokenization and reduced latency.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use text and code data for tokenizer training. The code data includes multiple programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Shell, SQL, and TypeScript. The text data is a subset of the Pile dataset.
    Step 2: Train Baseline Tokenizer: Train a baseline SentencePiece BPE tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 51K tokens using the gathered datasets. Ensure the tokenizer operates on a byte-level representation and includes all base bytes to guarantee lossless encoding.
    Step 3: Implement Fusion Token Algorithm: Implement the Fusion Token algorithm as outlined in Algorithm 1. Start with the existing 51K BPE vocabulary and iteratively add 1024 fusion tokens by grouping up to 10-grams of tokens based on their occurrence probabilities.
    Step 4: Train Fusion Token Tokenizer: Train the Fusion Token tokenizer with the additional 1024 tokens on top of the 51K BPE vocabulary using the same datasets.
    Step 5: Evaluate Compression Rate: Evaluate the compression rate (bytes per token) for both the baseline 51K BPE tokenizer and the 51K + 1K Fusion Token tokenizer across different data domains (text and various programming languages).
    Step 6: Train Language Models: Train language models of different sizes (125M and 650M parameters) using both the baseline 51K BPE tokenizer and the 51K + 1K Fusion Token tokenizer.
    Step 7: Measure Performance: Measure the performance of the trained language models on code generation benchmarks such as MBXP and Multi-lingual HumanEval (JavaScript subset). Evaluate metrics such as pass@1 and pass@5.
    Step 8: Analyze Latency: Compare the inference time and the number of tokens required for different programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, TypeScript) between the baseline BPE and Fusion Token tokenizers.
    Step 9: Analyze Results: Compare the bits per word (BPW) and bits per byte (BPB) for the language models trained with both tokenizers. Analyze the impact of Fusion Token on compression rate, model performance, and inference latency.

Junk DNA Hypothesis:
  Title: Junk DNA Hypothesis: A Task-Centric Angle of LLM Pre-trained Weights through Sparsity
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of excessive redundancy in the weights of large language models (LLMs). It challenges the conventional belief that a significant number of low-magnitude weights can be pruned without compromising performance. The problem is interesting and important because understanding the role of these weights can lead to more efficient model pruning techniques and better performance on complex tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods assume that low-magnitude weights are insignificant and can be pruned without affecting model performance. However, this assumption may overlook the nuanced roles these weights play, especially in complex tasks. The inspiration behind the new proposed method comes from biological insights into 'Junk DNA,' which was initially considered useless but later found to have critical functions. The proposed method aims to isolate and quantify the significance of low-magnitude weights, showing that they encode crucial knowledge necessary for solving difficult downstream tasks.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method employs sparsity, specifically weight pruning, to isolate and quantify the significance of low-magnitude weights in pre-trained LLMs. The study introduces the 'Junk DNA Hypothesis,' which posits that while small-magnitude weights may appear nearly useless for simple tasks, they encode crucial knowledge necessary for solving more difficult downstream tasks. The method involves several quantifiable metrics for gauging downstream task difficulty and extensive experiments to validate the hypothesis across various model scales, tasks, and datasets.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets used include SST-2, QNLI, MNLI from the GLUE benchmark, and multilingual translation datasets from the open-source parallel corpus (OPU, 2020). Additionally, the TriviaQA dataset is used for QA tasks.
    Step 2: Define Task Difficulty Settings:
      Setting 1: Varying the Adequacy of Target Domain Data: Vary the volume of data used for fine-tuning by randomly sampling various ratios from the target domain dataset.
      Setting 2: Majority vs. Minority in Multi-Domain Learning: Focus on multilingual translation tasks, categorizing majority language pairs as easy tasks and minority language pairs as hard tasks.
      Setting 3: With vs. Without Available External Information: Compare Open-book QA (easier) and Closed-book QA (harder) tasks using the TriviaQA dataset.
      Setting 4: Estimating LLM-facing Task Difficulty by Normalized Human-LLM Performance Gap: Define task difficulty as the disparity in performance between humans and models, normalized by human performance.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used include RoBERTa-Large/Base, mBART for multilingual translation, and Vicuna-7B for QA tasks.
    Step 4: Pruning Methods: Employ magnitude-based pruning, SparseGPT, and Wanda for generating sparse models. Use both unstructured and structured (N:M) sparsity.
    Step 5: Fine-Tuning Settings:
      Dense Transfer: Fine-tune the dense model on downstream tasks.
      Sparse Transfer: Prune small-magnitude weights and fine-tune the sparse model on downstream tasks.
      Dense Transfer with Freezing: Fine-tune the dense model while keeping small-magnitude weights fixed.
      Sparse to Dense Transfer: Prune small-magnitude weights, then allow them to grow freely during fine-tuning.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of dense and sparse models on various downstream tasks under different task difficulty settings.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of different fine-tuning settings to validate the Junk DNA Hypothesis. Analyze the impact of pruning on easy vs. hard tasks and the role of small-magnitude weights in preserving the loss basin.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

Both papers address important aspects of language model efficiency and performance. The Fusion Token paper focuses on improving tokenization efficiency, while the Junk DNA Hypothesis paper explores the significance of low-magnitude weights in pre-trained language models.

Strengths of the Fusion Token paper:
- Addresses the need for more efficient tokenization techniques to reduce computational costs
- Proposes a novel method that expands token groups from bi-grams to 10-grams, achieving higher compression rates with fewer tokens
- Provides a clear step-by-step experiment plan to evaluate the proposed method across different data domains and model sizes
- Measures performance on code generation benchmarks and analyzes the impact on compression rate, model performance, and inference latency

Weaknesses of the Fusion Token paper:
- Focuses primarily on computational efficiency and may not directly address the interpretability or generalization capabilities of the language models
- The evaluation is limited to code generation tasks and may not cover a wide range of natural language understanding tasks

Strengths of the Junk DNA Hypothesis paper:
- Challenges the conventional belief that low-magnitude weights can be pruned without compromising performance
- Proposes a novel hypothesis inspired by biological insights, suggesting that low-magnitude weights encode crucial knowledge for solving difficult downstream tasks
- Introduces quantifiable metrics for gauging downstream task difficulty and provides extensive experiments across various model scales, tasks, and datasets
- Explores the impact of pruning on easy vs. hard tasks and the role of small-magnitude weights in preserving the loss basin

Weaknesses of the Junk DNA Hypothesis paper:
- The hypothesis may be challenging to validate conclusively, as the significance of low-magnitude weights could be task-dependent and may vary across different model architectures
- The paper does not provide a direct solution for model compression or efficiency improvement, focusing more on understanding the role of low-magnitude weights

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, the Junk DNA Hypothesis paper appears to be more suitable for acceptance at a top AI conference like ICLR or ACL. The paper addresses a fundamental question in language model understanding and challenges a widely accepted assumption. It provides a novel perspective inspired by biological insights and conducts extensive experiments across various settings to validate the hypothesis. The findings have the potential to influence future research in model pruning and interpretation.

On the other hand, while the Fusion Token paper proposes an interesting method for improving tokenization efficiency, its focus is more narrow and primarily addresses computational aspects. The Junk DNA Hypothesis paper has a broader impact and contributes to a deeper understanding of language model behavior, making it a stronger candidate for acceptance.

Reward Model Ensembles Help Mitigate Overoptimization:
  Title: Reward Model Ensembles Help Mitigate Overoptimization
  Problem Statement: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models to follow instructions. However, learned reward models, which approximate human preferences, are imperfect and susceptible to overoptimization. Overoptimization occurs when policy optimization appears to make progress according to the learned reward model but regresses with respect to the true reward function.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as increasing the size of the proxy reward model or the amount of training data, have been shown to reduce but not eliminate overoptimization. These methods can be costly and impractical. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to use ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives, which have shown promise in improving robustness in other machine learning contexts. The proposed method is expected to work better because it combines multiple reward models to provide a more reliable estimate of the true reward, thus mitigating the risk of overoptimization.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives, specifically worst-case optimization (WCO) and uncertainty-weighted optimization (UWO), to mitigate reward model overoptimization. The method works as follows: 1) Train an ensemble of reward models using different random seeds. 2) During policy optimization, combine the reward estimates from different ensemble members using mean optimization, WCO, or UWO. 3) For WCO, choose the lowest reward from the ensemble at every step. 4) For UWO, combine the average reward with the intra-ensemble variance, weighted by a coefficient λ, to penalize high disagreement among reward models.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the Alpaca dataset (Taori et al., 2023) with 52,000 instructions and corresponding demonstrations. Use the AlpacaFarm variant for splits in different RLHF stages and for validation.
    Step 2: Pretrain Models: Use pretrained language models from the Pythia suite (Biderman et al., 2023). The policy model is the 1.4B Pythia model. Proxy reward models are derived from Pythia models of sizes 14M, 70M, and 1.4B.
    Step 3: Supervised Fine-tuning: Fine-tune both the policy model and the proxy reward model using 10k instruction demonstrations from the 'sft' split of the AlpacaFarm dataset. Use a learning rate of 8e-6, 3 epochs, and a batch size of 4.
    Step 4: Generate Preferences: Prompt the SFT model using instructions from the AlpacaFarm dataset to generate two responses per instruction. Score these responses with the gold reward model and optionally mislabel 25% of the dataset to simulate real-world conditions.
    Step 5: Train Proxy Reward Models: Train proxy reward models by minimizing cross-entropy loss on the preference dataset. Use a learning rate of 1e-5, 5 epochs, and a batch size of 32. Train an ensemble of five reward models using different random seeds.
    Step 6: Policy Optimization: Use two optimization methods: (a) Best-of-n sampling (BoN): Generate n responses for a given prompt and return the one with the highest proxy reward model score. Evaluate up to n=12,500 samples. (b) Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): Use a learning rate of 1e-6, cosine annealing scheduler to 1e-7, 4 PPO epochs, batch size of 32, 256 rollouts, and 32 chunk size. Train for 3000 PPO steps.
    Step 7: Evaluate Performance: Compare the performance of single reward model optimization with ensemble-based conservative optimization methods (mean, WCO, UWO) using the gold reward model score. Analyze the impact of ensemble size and uncertainty penalty weight on performance. Evaluate robustness to different levels of label noise and scaling of model and data sizes.


paper 2:
ChunkAttention:
  Title: ChunkAttention: Efficient Attention on KV Cache with Chunking Sharing and Batching
  Problem Statement: Self-attention is a critical component of GPT-style models and a significant cause of inference latency for long sequences in large language models (LLMs). In multi-tenant LLM inference servers, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be amortized by leveraging the probability that sequences from users may share long prompt prefixes.
  Motivation: Existing methods do not automatically discover and remove redundancy in the KV cache, requiring manual intervention and protocols, which introduces scalability and maintainability issues. Additionally, current self-attention implementations do not leverage shared KV cache to provide extra performance benefits during inference. The proposed method, ChunkAttention, aims to address these gaps by recognizing matching prompt prefixes across several sequences and sharing their KV cache in memory, thus improving memory reuse and speeding up self-attention for long shared prompts.
  Proposed Method: ChunkAttention introduces a unique self-attention kernel built on chunking, sharing the KV cache, and batching the attention computation. It organizes the KV cache into an auxiliary prefix tree to dynamically discover and remove redundancy at runtime. The method involves two-phase partitioning: a chunk-first phase where shared chunks are processed in parallel, and a sequence-first phase where individual sequences are processed. This approach reduces memory operations and improves throughput by batching attention operations of several sequences.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments do not specify particular datasets but focus on evaluating the performance of the self-attention mechanism with varying sequence lengths and batch sizes.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper. Instead, the focus is on the self-attention mechanism and its performance.
    Step 3: Select Models: The experiments are conducted using the LLaMA-7B model, with the head dimension size set to 128 and the number of heads set to 32.
    Step 4: Implement ChunkAttention: Implement and compile the ChunkAttention GPU kernel with CUDA 11.8 on A100 and CUDA 12.0 on RTX 4090. Enable iteration-based batching to form batches for the kernel to run efficiently.
    Step 5: Run Experiments:
      Experiment 1: Vary Shared Token Count: Evaluate the performance of ChunkAttention with shared token counts ranging from 256 to 8192. Measure the token rate (tokens per second) and compare it with baseline implementations (Naive PyTorch, xformers, FlashAttention, and PagedAttention).
      Experiment 2: Vary Batch Size: Evaluate the performance of ChunkAttention with batch sizes ranging from 1 to 128. Measure the token rate and compare it with baseline implementations.
      Experiment 3: Test on Different Hardware: Evaluate the performance of ChunkAttention on different hardware configurations (A100 40G, A100 80G, and RTX 4090). Measure the latency of decoding the first completion token and compare it with PagedAttention.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the throughput and latency improvements of ChunkAttention against the baseline implementations. Analyze the impact of shared token count, batch size, and hardware configurations on the performance of ChunkAttention.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they focus on different aspects of the problem.

Paper 1, "Reward Model Ensembles Help Mitigate Overoptimization," tackles the issue of overoptimization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) when fine-tuning large language models. The authors propose using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives to mitigate reward model overoptimization. The strengths of this paper include a well-defined problem statement, a clear motivation for the proposed method, and a detailed step-by-step experiment plan. The authors also consider real-world conditions by simulating label noise and evaluating the robustness of their method. The weaknesses of this paper are that it relies on a specific dataset (Alpaca) and pretrained models (Pythia), which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

Paper 2, "ChunkAttention: Efficient Attention on KV Cache with Chunking Sharing and Batching," focuses on improving the efficiency of self-attention in GPT-style models for multi-tenant LLM inference servers. The authors propose a novel self-attention kernel that leverages chunking, sharing of KV cache, and batching of attention computation to reduce memory operations and improve throughput. The strengths of this paper include a clear problem statement, a well-motivated proposed method, and a comprehensive set of experiments that evaluate the performance of ChunkAttention under various conditions (shared token count, batch size, and hardware configurations). The authors also compare their method against several baseline implementations, demonstrating its superiority. The weaknesses of this paper are that it does not specify particular datasets and focuses solely on the self-attention mechanism, which may limit the broader applicability of the findings.

While both papers make valuable contributions, Paper 2 appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The proposed ChunkAttention method addresses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference and demonstrates significant improvements in throughput and latency compared to existing methods. The experiments are well-designed and cover a wide range of scenarios, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, the focus on efficient self-attention is highly relevant to the current challenges faced by the NLP community in deploying large language models in real-world settings.

Time Series Modeling at Scale:
  Title: Time Series Modeling at Scale: A Universal Representation Across Tasks and Domains
  Problem Statement: Time series data, which capture real-world phenomena such as human neuronal firing, tectonic activity, and atmospheric conditions, are challenging to analyze due to domain-specific timescales, complex multivariate relations, and disparate modeling objectives. Existing methods often target specific tasks or domains, limiting their generalizability and scalability.
  Motivation: Prior works in time series modeling are typically tailored to specific tasks (e.g., forecasting) or distinct domains (e.g., neural recordings), which restricts their applicability across different scenarios. The inspiration behind the proposed method, TOTEM, comes from the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) that use universal tokenizations to solve a variety of tasks via Transformers. The proposed method aims to create a universal, scalable approach for time series modeling that can handle multiple tasks and domains without domain- or task-specific preprocessing.
  Proposed Method: TOTEM (Tokenized Time Series Embeddings) introduces a task-agnostic embedding that projects a continuous time series of any length onto a discrete set of learned tokens. This embedding is derived by optimizing a self-supervised objective formulated as a task-independent convolution-based vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The discrete token sequences are then used to learn downstream models with the powerful Transformer architecture. TOTEM is evaluated on forecasting, classification, and translation tasks across various domains, demonstrating its scalability and zero-shot generalization capabilities.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on datasets from five domains: neuroscience (Neuro), seismology (Earthquake), meteorology (Weather), power grids (Electricity), and urban traffic (Traffic). For forecasting, we use Weather, Electricity, and Traffic data from popular benchmarks, and three human-brain ECoG datasets (NeuroA, NeuroB, NeuroC). For classification, we use NeuroA, NeuroB, and NeuroC. For translation, we introduce a dataset of phase-sensitive seismograms and use NeuroA, NeuroB, and NeuroC.
    Step 2: Construct Tokenizer: We use a VQ-VAE based tokenizer called TimeVQ to learn a codebook of discrete time series tokens. The encoder consists of strided 1D convolutions, and the decoder consists of 1D transpose convolutions. The codebook is learned via self-supervision, optimizing a reconstruction loss and a commitment loss. The input time series are normalized to be scale-invariant before tokenization.
    Step 3: Select Models: For downstream tasks, we use Transformer-based submodules: Time Transformer Encoder (Time XEncoder), Sensor Transformer Encoder (Sensor XEncoder), and Scale Reinstater. These submodules are combined in different ways for forecasting, classification, and translation tasks.
    Step 4: Train Models: For forecasting, we train a Time XEncoder with 4 layers and 4 attention heads, and a feed-forward hidden dimension of 256. For classification, both Time and Sensor XEncoders consist of 2 layers and 2 attention heads, with a hidden dimension of 128. For translation, both Time and Sensor XEncoders consist of 4 layers and 4 attention heads, with a hidden dimension of 256. We use Adam optimizer with a base learning rate of 0.0001 and a one-cycle learning rate scheduler.
    Step 5: Evaluate Models: We evaluate forecasting performance using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) on different prediction horizons (96, 192, 336, 720). For classification, we report accuracy on the test set. For translation, we report MSE and MAE between predicted and ground truth measurements. We also conduct zero-shot generalization experiments to evaluate the models on unseen datasets within the same domain.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of TOTEM with state-of-the-art methods like TiDE and PatchTST on forecasting tasks. For classification, compare TOTEM with EEGNet. For translation, compare TOTEM with an MLP baseline. Analyze the zero-shot generalization capabilities of TOTEM across all tasks and domains.

SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask:
  Title: SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask
  Problem Statement: The transformer architecture has driven significant advancements in tasks requiring modeling pairwise relationships between sequential elements, such as natural language understanding. However, the quadratic complexity of the attention operation poses a problem for long sequences, making it computationally expensive and memory-intensive.
  Motivation: Existing methods to reduce the complexity of the attention operation either sparsify or linearly approximate the attention matrix. However, these methods have limitations: they cannot easily distill knowledge from a teacher’s attention matrix, often require complete retraining from scratch, and lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention matrices. The proposed method, SEA, aims to address these challenges by maintaining interpretability, enabling knowledge distillation, and reducing memory usage while achieving better performance.
  Proposed Method: SEA (Sparse linear attention with Estimated Attention mask) estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity using kernel-based linear attention. It then creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation. The method involves two main phases: (1) Attention Estimation using Performer and a CNN decoder to create a compressed attention matrix, and (2) Sparse Attention Mask Generation and Subsequent Sparse Attention using grouped top-k selection methods. SEA maintains an interpretable attention matrix and can utilize knowledge distillation to lower the complexity of existing pretrained transformers.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate SEA on language modeling tasks using the Wikitext2 dataset and text classification tasks using the GLUE benchmark (including MNLI, COLA, and MRPC subsets).
    Step 2: Model Architecture and Training Objectives:
      Model Architecture: SEA replaces the multi-head attention mechanism in transformer models with its sparse linear attention mechanism. The architecture includes a kernel-based linear attention method (Performer) and a CNN decoder to estimate the attention matrix.
      Training Objectives: SEA is trained using knowledge distillation from a pretrained quadratic transformer model. The training loss includes terms for approximating the attention matrix, attention probabilities, context features, and layer-wise outputs. The overall training loss is a weighted sum of these terms.
    Step 3: Select Models: We apply SEA to BERT for text classification and to OPT for causal language modeling. We compare SEA with baseline methods such as Reformer, Performer, Cosformer, Sinkhorn, and Synthesizer.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the selected datasets. For language modeling, measure perplexity scores on Wikitext2. For text classification, measure accuracy, F1 score, and other relevant metrics on the GLUE benchmark.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of SEA with baseline methods in terms of perplexity, accuracy, memory usage, and latency. Visualize the estimated attention matrices and analyze the interpretability of the attention patterns. Additionally, evaluate the efficiency of SEA in terms of memory and computational cost, and explore the impact of dynamically adjusting the sparsity parameter k after training.

paper 1:
Examining the Achilles' Heel of CLIP Models: The Worst-Performing Categories:
  Title: Examining the Achilles' Heel of CLIP Models: The Worst-Performing Categories
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the issue of certain categories in CLIP models performing significantly worse than the overall model accuracy, which poses risks in risk-sensitive applications. For instance, on ImageNet, some categories have a class-wise accuracy as low as 0%, despite the overall performance being 64.1%.
  Motivation: Existing methods focus on improving the overall accuracy of CLIP models through well-designed textual prompts but overlook the performance of individual categories. This oversight can be problematic, especially in applications where the accuracy of specific categories is critical. The proposed method aims to identify and improve the worst-performing categories by investigating the alignment between visual and textual modalities in CLIP models.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces the Class-wise Matching Margin (CMM) to measure inference confusion and identify the worst-performing categories. CMM evaluates the margin of similarity between image representations and different prompts. The method also involves querying large language models to enrich descriptions of the worst-performing categories and building a weighted ensemble to highlight efficient prompts.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Conduct experiments on ImageNet and 11 additional benchmarks: CIFAR100, Caltech101, Cars196, DTD, EuroSat, Food-101, Oxford-Flowers, Oxford-Pets, Resisc45, SUN397, and FGVCAircraft.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Use a pool of candidate templates provided in the original CLIP paper. For each dataset, construct prompts such as 'a photo of a [CLASS]' and other variations. Enrich descriptions for the worst-performing categories using large language models like GPT-3.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use pre-trained CLIP models with ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/14 backbones.
    Step 4: Calculate CMM: For each template, calculate the pseudo label of each sample in the dataset. Compute the Class-wise Matching Margin (CMM) to identify categories with the worst performance.
    Step 5: Enrich Descriptions: For the identified worst-performing categories, query large language models to generate detailed descriptions. Use these enriched descriptions to improve the textual prompts.
    Step 6: Weighted Prompt Ensemble: Assign weights to different templates based on their CMM scores. Use softmax normalization to determine the weights and construct a weighted ensemble for final predictions.
    Step 7: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the gathered datasets, focusing on worst@k accuracy, harmonic mean (HM), geometric mean (GM), and overall accuracy.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with existing baselines, such as Prompt Ensemble and ZPE, to verify the effectiveness of CPE in improving the worst-performing categories.


paper 2:
MAmmoTH: Building Math Generalist Models through Hybrid Instruction Tuning:
  Title: MAmmoTH: Building Math Generalist Models through Hybrid Instruction Tuning
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of developing large language models (LLMs) that can effectively solve a wide range of mathematical problems. Current open-source LLMs lag significantly behind closed-source models in mathematical reasoning tasks, and existing methods either incur high computational costs or fail to generalize well to diverse math problems.
  Motivation: Existing methods for improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs either involve continued pre-training on large math-related datasets, which is computationally expensive, or fine-tuning on specific datasets, which limits generalization. The proposed method, MAmmoTH, aims to bridge this gap by using a hybrid instruction tuning approach that combines chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both CoT and PoT, enabling the model to handle a broader range of mathematical problems more effectively.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves training a series of LLMs, called MAmmoTH, on a curated dataset named MathInstruct. MathInstruct is compiled from 13 math datasets and includes both CoT and PoT rationales. The hybrid approach allows the model to use natural language for step-by-step reasoning (CoT) and external tools like Python for complex computations (PoT). The models are fine-tuned on MathInstruct and evaluated on various in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning datasets.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Compile the MathInstruct dataset from 13 existing math datasets, including GSM8K, MATH, AQuA-RAT, NumGLUE, and others. Ensure the dataset includes both CoT and PoT rationales.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For CoT, prompt the model to generate step-by-step natural language explanations. For PoT, prompt the model to generate executable Python code. Use hybrid prompts that combine both approaches for different types of problems.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use Llama-2 and Code Llama as the base models. Fine-tune models of different scales (7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B) on the MathInstruct dataset.
    Step 4: Training Setup: Fine-tune the models using the Huggingface transformers library. Use a learning rate of 2e-5 for 7B and 13B models, and 1e-5 for 34B and 70B models. Set the batch size at 128 and use a cosine scheduler with a 3% warm-up period for three epochs. Employ DeepSpeed training with ZeRO-3 stage for larger models.
    Step 5: Evaluation Setup: Evaluate the models on a spectrum of datasets, including in-domain (GSM8K, MATH, AQuA-RAT, NumGLUE) and out-of-domain (SVAMP, SAT, MMLU-Math, Mathematics, SimulEq) test sets. Use both CoT and PoT decoding methods, and introduce a hybrid decoding strategy where the model first attempts PoT and falls back to CoT if the program is not executable.
    Step 6: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets using both the baselines and the proposed hybrid method.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of MAmmoTH models with existing baselines. Evaluate the impact of diverse data sources and hybrid rationales on the models' generalization capabilities. Analyze the performance gains on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in their respective domains. The first paper, "Examining the Achilles' Heel of CLIP Models: The Worst-Performing Categories," focuses on identifying and improving the worst-performing categories in CLIP models. The authors propose a novel method called Class-wise Matching Margin (CMM) to measure inference confusion and identify these categories. They also suggest enriching descriptions for the worst-performing categories using large language models and building a weighted ensemble to highlight efficient prompts. The experiment plan is well-structured and covers a diverse set of datasets.

The second paper, "MAmmoTH: Building Math Generalist Models through Hybrid Instruction Tuning," tackles the challenge of developing large language models that can effectively solve a wide range of mathematical problems. The authors propose a hybrid instruction tuning approach that combines chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales. They introduce a curated dataset named MathInstruct, compiled from 13 math datasets, to train their models. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, and the authors propose a hybrid decoding strategy to leverage the strengths of both CoT and PoT.

While both papers have their merits, the second paper, "MAmmoTH," appears to have a slight edge. The problem it addresses is more significant, as developing math generalist models that can handle a wide range of problems is a crucial challenge in the field. The proposed hybrid approach is innovative and has the potential to bridge the gap between open-source and closed-source models. Additionally, the curated MathInstruct dataset and the hybrid decoding strategy demonstrate the authors' commitment to creating a robust and generalizable solution.

In contrast, while the first paper's focus on worst-performing categories is important, it is a more specific problem within the domain of CLIP models. The proposed method, although novel, may have limited impact on the overall performance of CLIP models.

Considering the broader impact, methodological innovation, and the potential for generalization, the second paper, "MAmmoTH," is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

Efficiently Measuring the Cognitive Ability of LLMs: An Adaptive Testing Perspective:
  Title: Efficiently Measuring the Cognitive Ability of LLMs: An Adaptive Testing Perspective
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated human-level cognitive abilities. However, traditional evaluation methods using fixed benchmarks and standard metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1 score are inefficient and inaccurate from a cognitive science perspective. The problem is to develop a more efficient and accurate method for evaluating the cognitive abilities of LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLMs are inefficient because they require many experts to score responses, especially for subjective or creative questions. They are also inaccurate because they do not dynamically adjust the difficulty of test questions based on the model's performance. Inspired by Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) used in psychometrics, the proposed method aims to dynamically adjust the characteristics of test questions, such as difficulty, based on the model's performance. This approach allows for a more accurate estimation of the model's abilities using fewer questions and facilitates easier comparison between LLMs and humans.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces an adaptive testing framework for LLM evaluation, inspired by CAT. The framework dynamically adjusts the characteristics of test questions based on the model's performance. It involves two main components: (1) Ability Estimation using Item Response Theory (IRT) and (2) Question Selection using Fisher Information. The process is iterative, where the model's ability is estimated after each response, and the next question is selected to maximize the informativeness of the test. This approach reduces the number of questions needed to achieve the same measurement accuracy as traditional methods.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use three datasets to evaluate LLMs from three key areas: Subject Knowledge Level (MOOC), Mathematical Reasoning Level (MATH), and Programming Level (CODE). The MOOC dataset collects students' answer records on various knowledge concepts in computer science. The MATH dataset contains mathematical test items and logs of high school examinations. The CODE dataset includes code submissions of students from various universities.
    Step 2: Construct Question Pools: Before the formal educational assessment begins, we use the question sets in the datasets to construct the question pools. An Item Response Theory (IRT) model is fit to the large-scale response data to estimate the parameters of all questions, such as difficulty, discrimination, and guessing factors. This step ensures that the questions are calibrated and ready for adaptive testing.
    Step 3: Adaptive Testing: The CAT system interacts with the LLM for multiple rounds. The LLM answers the questions selected by the selection algorithm, and IRT updates the ability estimate based on the responses. The process continues until the stopping rule is met. The final ability estimate is output as the result. This step involves two components: (1) Ability Estimation using IRT and (2) Question Selection using Fisher Information.
    Step 4: Compare LLMs and Humans: We compare the cognitive abilities of different LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT4, Bard, ERNIEBot, QianWen, and Spark) with high-ability and mid-ability students. The comparison is done across three aspects: Subject Knowledge, Mathematical Reasoning, and Programming. The ability estimates are used to rank the models and compare them with human performance.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: We analyze the evaluation efficiency of the proposed adaptive testing framework by comparing it with traditional evaluation methods. We also study the reliability of the framework by examining the standard error (SE) curves during the testing process. Additionally, we investigate the characteristics of ChatGPT's responses, such as its tendency to guess and slip, and compare them with human responses.


paper 2:
RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval:
  Title: RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval
  Problem Statement: Existing retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) typically retrieve only short, contiguous chunks from a retrieval corpus, which limits their ability to understand and leverage the overall document context. This limitation hinders the performance of RALMs on tasks that require integrating knowledge from multiple parts of a text, such as complex question-answering tasks.
  Motivation: While RALMs can adapt to changes in world state and incorporate long-tail knowledge, their retrieval methods often fail to capture the holistic context of lengthy documents. Traditional methods retrieve only short, contiguous text chunks, which are insufficient for tasks requiring a comprehensive understanding of the document. The proposed method, RAPTOR, aims to address this by recursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing chunks of text to construct a hierarchical tree structure. This approach allows for retrieval at different levels of abstraction, enabling better integration of information across lengthy documents.
  Proposed Method: RAPTOR constructs a hierarchical tree structure by recursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing chunks of text. The process starts with segmenting the retrieval corpus into short, contiguous texts, which are then embedded using SBERT. These chunks form the leaf nodes of the tree. A clustering algorithm groups similar text chunks, and a language model generates summaries for these clusters. This process is repeated until further clustering is infeasible, resulting in a multi-layered tree representation. At inference time, RAPTOR retrieves information from this tree using two strategies: tree traversal and collapsed tree. The tree traversal method selects the most relevant nodes at each level, while the collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate RAPTOR on three question-answering datasets: NarrativeQA, QASPER, and QuALITY. NarrativeQA involves question-answer pairs based on books and movie transcripts. QASPER includes questions probing information within NLP papers. QuALITY consists of multiple-choice questions with context passages averaging 5,000 tokens in length.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For summarization, we use the following prompt: 'Write a summary of the following, including as many key details as possible: {context}'. For querying, we use two methods: tree traversal and collapsed tree. In tree traversal, we start at the root layer, compute cosine similarity between the query and node embeddings, and select the top-k nodes at each level. In collapsed tree, we flatten the tree into a single layer, compute cosine similarity for all nodes, and select the top-k nodes until a predefined token limit is reached.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use three language models for our experiments: UnifiedQA-3B, GPT-3, and GPT-4. For summarization, we use gpt-3.5-turbo.
    Step 4: Get Results: Retrieve context using RAPTOR and the baseline methods (SBERT, BM25, DPR) for each dataset. Generate answers using the selected language models with the retrieved context.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of RAPTOR with the baseline methods on the three datasets. Metrics include ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR for NarrativeQA, F1 for QASPER, and accuracy for QuALITY. Analyze the contribution of different tree layers to RAPTOR's performance and the impact of hallucinations in the summaries.

Both papers propose novel methods for evaluating and enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, they differ in their focus and approach.

Paper 1 addresses the problem of efficiently and accurately measuring the cognitive abilities of LLMs. The proposed adaptive testing framework, inspired by Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), dynamically adjusts the difficulty of test questions based on the model's performance. This approach allows for a more accurate estimation of the model's abilities using fewer questions and facilitates easier comparison between LLMs and humans. The paper's strengths lie in its innovative application of psychometric methods to LLM evaluation and its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cognitive ability assessment.

Paper 2 focuses on improving the retrieval capabilities of retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) by constructing a hierarchical tree structure of the retrieval corpus. The proposed method, RAPTOR, recursively embeds, clusters, and summarizes chunks of text to enable retrieval at different levels of abstraction. This approach allows for better integration of information across lengthy documents, which is crucial for tasks requiring a comprehensive understanding of the context. The paper's strengths lie in its novel approach to organizing and retrieving information from large corpora and its potential to enhance the performance of RALMs on complex question-answering tasks.

While both papers make significant contributions to their respective areas, Paper 1 stands out for its potential to revolutionize the way we evaluate the cognitive abilities of LLMs. The adaptive testing framework not only improves the efficiency and accuracy of the evaluation process but also enables more meaningful comparisons between LLMs and humans. Furthermore, the paper's interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from cognitive science and psychometrics, demonstrates a deeper understanding of the problem and a more comprehensive solution.

In contrast, Paper 2, while proposing a novel method for information retrieval, focuses on a more specific problem within the domain of RALMs. The hierarchical tree structure, while innovative, may face challenges in terms of computational complexity and the quality of the generated summaries. Additionally, the paper's evaluation is limited to three datasets, which may not fully demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method.

ACES: Generating Diverse Programming Puzzles with Autotelic Language Models and Semantic Descriptors:
  Title: ACES: Generating Diverse Programming Puzzles with Autotelic Language Models and Semantic Descriptors
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of automated generation of diverse and interesting Python programming puzzles. This problem is crucial for applications in education, data augmentation for AI model training, and automated scientific discoveries. The challenge lies in generating puzzles that are not only diverse but also align with human perceptions of interesting variations.
  Motivation: Existing generative models often aim at modeling a reference distribution without explicit diversity optimization. Methods that do optimize for diversity either use limited hand-coded representation spaces or learned embedding spaces that may not align with human perceptions. The proposed method, ACES, leverages semantic descriptors evaluated by a large language model (LLM) to directly optimize for interesting diversity. This approach is expected to generate a richer diversity of puzzles that are more aligned with human perceptions of interesting variations.
  Proposed Method: ACES (Autotelic Code Exploration via Semantic descriptors) is a new autotelic generation method that leverages semantic descriptors produced by an LLM to directly optimize for interesting diversity. Each puzzle is labeled along 10 dimensions, each capturing a programming skill required to solve it. ACES generates and pursues novel and feasible goals to explore that abstract semantic space, slowly discovering a diversity of solvable programming puzzles in any given run.

Tailoring Self-Rationalizers with Multi-Reward Distillation:
  Title: Tailoring Self-Rationalizers with Multi-Reward Distillation
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LMs) can generate free-text rationales to aid question answering, but useful self-rationalization typically emerges only at significant scales (e.g., 175B parameter GPT-3). Prior work focuses largely on downstream performance, ignoring the semantics of the rationales themselves, such as their faithfulness, truthfulness, and helpfulness for humans.
  Motivation: Existing methods suggest that high-quality self-rationalization is only achievable with very large models, which are resource-intensive. Additionally, these methods often overlook the quality of the rationales themselves, focusing instead on task performance. This can lead to rationales that are not plausible, consistent, or diverse, which are crucial for human utility. The proposed method aims to enable small-scale LMs (∼200x smaller than GPT-3) to generate high-quality rationales that improve both task performance and the quality of the rationales themselves.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, MaRio (Multi-rewArd RatIOnalization), is a multi-reward conditioned self-rationalization algorithm that optimizes multiple distinct properties like plausibility, diversity, and consistency. MaRio starts with training a small LM using rationales generated by GPT-3 as initial supervision. It then casts the problem into a multi-reward conditioned rationale generation problem, where the LM is optimized to maximize quality rewards. The method extends Q UARK to a multi-reward setup, where generations from an LM are binned according to reward values, and the LM learns distributions conditioned on ‘control-tokens’ corresponding to every reward. High-quality generations are obtained via conditioning on the highest-reward token.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on five question-answering datasets: StrategyQA, QuaRel, OpenBookQA, NumerSense, and QASC. These datasets require implicit or logical reasoning to arrive at the answer.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, we use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with rationales generated by GPT-3. For MaRio, we first train the small LM with GPT-3 generated rationales as initial supervision. Then, we use multi-reward training to optimize the LM for plausibility, diversity, and consistency.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use T5-LARGE (0.7B parameters) for SFT and all MaRio experiments. We also use T5-BASE for our consistency models.
    Step 4: Define Rewards: We use the following rewards: (1) Plausibility via VERA, a trained commonsense statement verification model; (2) Consistency via a framework that evaluates the association between a rationale and a label; (3) Diversity via n-gram uniqueness; (4) Task-Correctness, a binary score indicating the correctness of the predicted answer.
    Step 5: Train Models: For SFT, we fine-tune T5-LARGE using the training data described in Step 1. For MaRio, we iteratively train the LM using the Q UARK algorithm extended to multiple rewards. We use control tokens corresponding to each reward and optimize the LM to maximize these rewards.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the test sets of the five datasets. Collect metrics for task accuracy, plausibility, diversity, and consistency.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of MaRio against SFT and other baselines. Conduct human evaluations to assess the quality of the rationales generated by MaRio and SFT. Analyze whether MaRio improves both task performance and rationale quality.

Necessary and Sufficient Watermark for Large Language Models:
  Title: Necessary and Sufficient Watermark for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in generating human-like text, which poses a risk of misuse for malicious purposes such as generating fake news. It is crucial to develop methods to distinguish between texts written by LLMs and those written by humans.
  Motivation: Existing watermarking methods can detect LLM-generated texts but significantly degrade the quality of the generated text. The proposed method, Necessary and Sufficient Watermark (NS-Watermark), aims to insert watermarks into generated texts without degrading text quality. The inspiration behind this method is to derive the minimum constraints required to distinguish LLM-generated texts from human-written texts, thus ensuring high text quality while maintaining detection accuracy.
  Proposed Method: The NS-Watermark method involves formulating the watermarking process as a constrained optimization problem. The key steps are: 1) Derive the minimum constraints required to distinguish LLM-generated texts. 2) Formulate the NS-Watermark as a constrained optimization problem. 3) Propose an efficient algorithm to solve this optimization problem. The method ensures that the constraints are adaptive to the length of the generated text, allowing for more natural text generation without compromising detection accuracy.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the test dataset of WMT’14 French (Fr) ↔ English (En) and WMT’16 German (De) ↔ English (En) for machine translation tasks. For natural language generation, use subsets of the C4 dataset.
    Step 2: Select Models: Use the NLLB-200-3.3B model for machine translation tasks and the LLaMA-7B model for natural language generation tasks.
    Step 3: Set Hyperparameters: For the NS-Watermark, set the beam size (k) to 1, maximum number of words (Tmax) to 100, and perform a grid search over {0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001} for the hyperparameter γ. For the Soft-Watermark and Adaptive Soft-Watermark, perform a grid search over {4, 6, 8} for the hyperparameter δ.
    Step 4: Implement NS-Watermark Algorithm: Implement the NS-Watermark algorithm by filling the table T[t][g] for all (t, g) pairs and generating the text with the highest probability that satisfies the derived constraints. Use dynamic programming and beam search to solve the optimization problem efficiently.
    Step 5: Generate Texts: Generate texts using the NS-Watermark, Soft-Watermark, and Adaptive Soft-Watermark methods. For the NS-Watermark, ensure that the z-score of the generated text is greater than or equal to the threshold Z (set to 4).
    Step 6: Evaluate Text Quality and Detection Accuracy: Evaluate the generated texts using BLEU scores for machine translation tasks and perplexity (PPL) for natural language generation tasks. Measure detection accuracy using false negative rate (FNR), true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and true negative rate (TNR).
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the text quality and detection accuracy of the NS-Watermark with the Soft-Watermark and Adaptive Soft-Watermark. Analyze the relationships between z-score, the length of generated texts, and the number of green words contained in the generated texts. Evaluate the trade-off between text quality and robustness against post-editing by varying the hyperparameter β.

Chain-of-Experts:
  Title: Chain-of-Experts: When LLMs Meet Complex Operations Research Problems
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in various NLP tasks, including mathematical reasoning and plan generation. However, the automatic modeling and programming for complex operations research (OR) problems remain a significant challenge. These problems often require domain-specific knowledge and involve implicit constraints, making them difficult to solve without the expertise of domain specialists.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as NL4Opt, typically rely on a two-stage framework that performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify variables, parameters, and constraints from the input text, which are then converted into a mathematical optimization model. While effective for elementary OR problems, these approaches struggle with complex real-world challenges due to implicit constraints, the need for domain-specific knowledge, and long reasoning chains. The proposed Chain-of-Experts (CoE) framework aims to address these limitations by leveraging a multi-agent cooperative approach, where each agent is endowed with specific domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities. This collaborative framework, orchestrated by a conductor, is expected to outperform existing LLM-based approaches by effectively handling the complexities of OR problems.
  Proposed Method: The Chain-of-Experts (CoE) framework is a novel multi-agent cooperative system designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for solving complex OR problems. The framework consists of multiple specialized agents, each assigned a specific role and equipped with domain-specific knowledge. A central entity, the Conductor, orchestrates the sequence of interactions among these agents using a forward thought construction and backward reflection mechanism. The forward thought construction involves sequentially selecting experts to build a reasoning chain, while the backward reflection mechanism leverages external feedback to adjust the collaboration among experts based on the evaluation of problem-solving results. The CoE framework also includes a Reducer to summarize the collective insights from multiple experts into a final answer.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on two datasets: the LPWP dataset, which comprises 1101 elementary-level linear programming problems, and the newly constructed ComplexOR dataset, which includes 37 complex OR problems annotated by domain experts.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose novel methods to address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, there are notable differences in their problem statements, motivations, proposed methods, and experiment plans.

Paper 1 focuses on the problem of watermarking large language models to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written texts. The motivation is clear, as the misuse of LLMs for generating fake news is a significant concern. The proposed NS-Watermark method aims to insert watermarks without degrading text quality, which is a novel approach. The experiment plan is well-structured, with clear steps for data gathering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

On the other hand, Paper 2 addresses the challenge of applying LLMs to complex operations research problems. The motivation is to leverage the potential of LLMs in mathematical reasoning and plan generation while overcoming the limitations of existing methods. The proposed Chain-of-Experts framework is innovative, introducing a multi-agent cooperative approach with specialized agents and a conductor for orchestration. The experiment plan is comprehensive, with detailed prompts for each expert and a well-defined evaluation process.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 2 stands out for several reasons:
1. The problem statement is more novel and challenging, as applying LLMs to complex OR problems is an emerging area with significant potential impact.
2. The proposed Chain-of-Experts framework is more innovative and ambitious, introducing a multi-agent cooperative approach that goes beyond existing methods.
3. The experiment plan is more comprehensive and well-thought-out, with detailed prompts for each expert and a clear evaluation process.
4. The potential impact of the Chain-of-Experts framework extends beyond the specific problem addressed, as it could be applied to other complex domains requiring domain-specific knowledge and reasoning.

In conclusion, while both papers propose interesting methods, Paper 2 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference due to its novelty, innovation, and potential impact.

Negative Label Guided OOD Detection with Pretrained Vision-Language Models:
  Title: Negative Label Guided OOD Detection with Pretrained Vision-Language Models
  Problem Statement: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims at identifying samples from unknown classes, playing a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models, especially in critical applications like autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis. The challenge is to handle data from unknown classes effectively.
  Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods primarily focus on the vision modality and often ignore the rich textual information that can be leveraged by vision-language models (VLMs). Some recent methods attempt to design OOD detectors for VLMs but face limitations such as poor performance on large-scale datasets or ineffective exploitation of text interpretation capabilities. The proposed method, NegLabel, aims to address these limitations by introducing a large number of negative labels from extensive corpus databases, which can enhance the model's ability to distinguish OOD samples more effectively.
  Proposed Method: NegLabel is a novel post hoc OOD detection method that leverages a vast number of negative labels from extensive corpus databases. The method involves the following key steps: 1) NegMining algorithm to select high-quality negative labels with sufficient semantic differences from ID labels. 2) A novel scheme for the OOD score that combines the similarities of images with ID labels and negative labels. 3) Theoretical analysis to understand the mechanism of negative labels. 4) Extensive experiments to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and robustness against diverse domain shifts.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on the ImageNet-1k OOD benchmark, using ImageNet-1k as ID data and iNaturalist, SUN, Places, and Textures as OOD data. Additional datasets include Stanford-Cars, CUB-200, Oxford-Pet, Food-101, and subsets of ImageNet-1k for fine-grained analysis.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: We implement NegLabel on various VLM architectures, including CLIP (ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14, ResNet50, ResNet50x16), ALIGN (EfficientNet-B7), GroupViT, and AltCLIP (ViT-L/14).
    Step 4: Implement NegMining Algorithm: 1) Calculate text embeddings for ID labels and candidate negative labels. 2) Measure the distance between each candidate negative label and the ID labels using the 100η-th percentile of the negative cosine similarities. 3) Select the top-M negative labels with the greatest distances from the ID labels.
    Step 5: Calculate NegLabel Score: 1) Extract image embeddings using the image encoder. 2) Calculate the cosine similarities between the image embeddings and text embeddings of ID and negative labels. 3) Compute the NegLabel score using a sum-softmax form that combines the similarities of images with ID labels and negative labels.
    Step 6: Apply Grouping Strategy: Divide the selected negative labels into multiple groups. Calculate the OOD score for each group separately and then average the scores across groups to reduce the risk of false positives.
    Step 7: Get Results: Evaluate the OOD detection performance on the gathered datasets using the proposed method and compare it with existing baselines.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of NegLabel with existing methods in terms of AUROC and FPR95 metrics. Analyze the robustness of NegLabel against diverse domain shifts and its generalization capabilities across different VLM architectures.

Adaptive Environmental Modeling for Task-Oriented Language Agents:
  Title: Adaptive Environmental Modeling for Task-Oriented Language Agents
  Problem Statement: Intelligent agents, particularly those employing large language models (LLMs), face significant challenges in interactive and dynamic scenarios such as online shopping due to the absence of integrated environmental modeling. This lack of environmental modeling hinders the agents' ability to efficiently plan and operate in these environments.
  Motivation: Existing methods do not adequately address the need for integrated environmental modeling in dynamic and interactive scenarios. Traditional approaches either rely on static environmental models or do not incorporate environmental feedback effectively. The proposed method aims to enable language agents to autonomously and adaptively model new environments, thereby improving their performance in task-specific scenarios. The inspiration behind this method is to leverage the extensive pre-training knowledge of LLMs and their ability to perform recursive evaluations to build and update environmental models dynamically.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method consists of two main phases: Pre-Task Environment Exploration and In-Task Environment Update. In the Pre-Task Environment Exploration phase, a greedy exploration strategy is employed, where an agent acts as an Evaluator to explore environmental information based on current observations and feasible actions. This is implemented through a recursive algorithm that selects and executes the top-k scored actions to form an initial Action-Observation Tree. In the In-Task Environment Update phase, the agent uses the environmental information gathered during task execution to refine the environmental model iteratively. This process involves updating the environmental model based on the interaction trajectories generated during task execution, leading to mutual enhancement of task performance and environmental understanding.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use two benchmark datasets for evaluation: ALFWorld-Eco, a refined version of the ALFWorld dataset with 60 varied tasks, and WebShop, a web-based problem-solving benchmark with 1.18M real-world products and 12k human instructions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the Pre-Task Environment Exploration phase, we prompt the agent to select and execute the top-k actions based on current observations. For the In-Task Environment Update phase, we prompt the agent to use the initial environmental model to perform tasks and update the model based on the interaction trajectories.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use the React framework as the agent, with GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 as the core language models. The models are configured with specific parameters: temperature set to zero, maximum token limit of one hundred, top-p value set to one, and both frequency and presence penalties nullified.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of the environmental information acquired by the agent. Measure task performance improvement on both the ALFWorld-Eco and WebShop datasets.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the agent with and without the proposed environmental adaptation method. Assess the quality of the environmental information in terms of effectiveness (executable actions) and comprehensiveness (amount of environmental information). Analyze the improvement in task performance due to the dynamically updated environmental information.

Making Pre-trained Language Models Great on Tabular Prediction:
  Title: Making Pre-trained Language Models Great on Tabular Prediction
  Problem Statement: The transferability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has made significant progress in image and language processing. However, due to the heterogeneity among tables, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data prediction (e.g., regression or classification tasks).
  Motivation: Existing methods for tabular data prediction, such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), often outperform DNNs due to the heterogeneity and feature space shifts among tables. Language models (LMs) possess the capability to comprehend feature names from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferring knowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks. However, their discrete text representation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values in tables. The proposed method, TP-BERTa, aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel tokenization and attention mechanism to better handle numerical values and feature heterogeneity.
  Proposed Method: TP-BERTa is a specifically pre-trained language model for tabular data prediction. It introduces a novel relative magnitude tokenization to convert scalar numerical feature values into finely discrete, high-dimensional tokens. Additionally, an intra-feature attention approach integrates feature values with the corresponding feature names. This method allows the model to handle numerical values in a way that is compatible with the language model's discrete text representation space.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect 101 binary classification datasets and 101 regression datasets for pre-training. For downstream evaluation, gather 80 binary classification datasets and 65 regression datasets. Ensure that no subset of pre-training datasets appears in the downstream ones.
    Step 2: Pre-training TP-BERTa:
      Model Architecture: Use RoBERTa as the base model. Add nbin additional tokens to the RoBERTa vocabulary for numerical magnitude representation. Implement the intra-feature attention (IFA) module to fuse feature name-value pairs into single vectors.
      Training Objectives: Pre-train TP-BERTa on the collected datasets with a combination of supervised loss (binary cross-entropy for classification and mean squared error for regression) and a magnitude-aware triplet loss for regularizing magnitude embeddings.
      Training Details: Pre-train on four NVIDIA A100 GPUs with a total batch size of 512 per step. Use a linear warm-up for the first 6% of steps, followed by a linear decay to 0. Save the best checkpoint based on the average validation loss across all datasets.
    Step 3: Finetune TP-BERTa:
      Model Architecture: Use the pre-trained TP-BERTa model. For each downstream task, use task-specific prediction heads.
      Training Objectives: Finetune the model using only the supervised loss (binary cross-entropy for classification and mean squared error for regression).
      Training Details: Finetune on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs with a batch size of 64. Use default hyperparameters for TP-BERTa without tuning.
    Step 4: Baseline Comparisons:
      Models: Compare TP-BERTa with XGBoost, CatBoost, MLP, AutoInt, DCNv2, TabNet, FT-Transformer, SAINT, TransTab, and XTab.
      Metrics: Evaluate models using AUC for binary classification tasks and RMSE for regression tasks.
    Step 5: Analyze Results:
      Performance Analysis: Compare the performance of TP-BERTa with the baselines on the downstream datasets. Analyze the impact of feature type distributions and data volumes on model performance.
      Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the impact of different components of TP-BERTa, such as the number of magnitude tokens, the magnitude-aware triplet loss, and the intra-feature attention module.

Improving Compositional Text-to-image Generation with Large Vision-Language Models:
  Title: Improving Compositional Text-to-image Generation with Large Vision-Language Models
  Problem Statement: Compositional text-to-image models often struggle to generate high-quality images that accurately align with input texts describing multiple objects, variable attributes, and intricate spatial relationships. This misalignment manifests in inaccuracies in object number, attribute binding, spatial relationships, and aesthetic quality.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as manipulating the attention mechanism within diffusion models, fall short of comprehensively addressing the interrelated challenges of object number, attribute binding, spatial relationships, and aesthetic quality. Additionally, current evaluation techniques like CLIPScore or BLIP do not fully capture compositional alignment accurately. The proposed method leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for a more nuanced and detailed evaluation, which can then be used to fine-tune diffusion models and iteratively correct misalignments during inference.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves three main components: 1) LVLM-based Evaluation: Using LVLMs to assess the alignment between generated images and input texts across four dimensions: object number, attribute binding, spatial relationships, and aesthetic quality. 2) Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning the diffusion model based on the LVLM-assessed metrics using Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL). 3) LVLM-guided Editing: During inference, using LVLMs to identify and correct misalignments in the generated images iteratively until they are fully aligned with the input text.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use text-image pairs from LAION-5B and input text from DiffusionDB for training data. For evaluation, we use the dataset from T2ICompBench.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For LVLM-based Evaluation, we use LLama2 to generate question-answer pairs from the input text. Bard, a state-of-the-art LVLM, is then used to process these questions alongside the generated image to produce answers.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use Stable Diffusion as the baseline diffusion model. For LVLMs, we use Bard for both evaluation and guided editing.
    Step 4: Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the diffusion model using the ReFL methodology. The answer accuracy from the LVLM-based evaluation serves as the weight of the loss function for fine-tuning. The model is fine-tuned in half-precision with a learning rate of 10^-5 and a batch size of 64. The sample step range [T1, T2] is defined as [1, 10].
    Step 5: LVLM-guided Editing: During inference, generate an initial image using the fine-tuned diffusion model. Use Bard to identify misalignments in object number, attribute binding, spatial relationships, and aesthetic quality. Employ SAM to isolate objects and backgrounds, and use a diffusion-based inpainting model to correct the identified misalignments iteratively until the image is fully aligned with the input text.
    Step 6: Get Results: Generate images using both the baseline and fine-tuned models. Use Bard to evaluate the alignment of these images with the input texts.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the baseline and fine-tuned models using metrics such as CLIPScore and the detailed evaluation from Bard. Visualize the results to illustrate the improvements in alignment.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose novel methods to address important challenges in their respective domains. Paper 1 focuses on improving the performance of pre-trained language models on tabular data prediction, while Paper 2 aims to enhance compositional text-to-image generation using large vision-language models (LVLMs).

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the heterogeneity and feature space shifts among tables, which hinder the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) on tabular data prediction.
- Proposes a novel tokenization and attention mechanism to bridge the gap between the discrete text representation space of language models and numerical feature values in tables.
- Provides a detailed and well-structured experiment plan, including extensive baseline comparisons and ablation studies.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The proposed method may have limited applicability to tables with complex structures or non-numerical features.
- The computational cost of pre-training and fine-tuning TP-BERTa on large datasets may be high.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles the challenging problem of generating high-quality images that accurately align with input texts describing multiple objects, variable attributes, and intricate spatial relationships.
- Leverages LVLMs for a more nuanced and detailed evaluation of the alignment between generated images and input texts across four dimensions: object number, attribute binding, spatial relationships, and aesthetic quality.
- Proposes an iterative LVLM-guided editing process to correct misalignments in the generated images during inference.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The reliance on LVLMs for evaluation and guided editing may introduce additional computational overhead and potential biases.
- The iterative editing process during inference may be time-consuming, especially for complex input texts.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 2 appears to be the more promising and impactful work. The proposed method addresses a critical challenge in compositional text-to-image generation and offers a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of LVLMs for evaluation and guided editing. The iterative correction of misalignments during inference is a significant contribution that could lead to substantial improvements in the quality and accuracy of generated images. Additionally, the potential impact of this work extends beyond the specific task of text-to-image generation, as the proposed techniques could be adapted to other multimodal generation tasks.

In contrast, while Paper 1 proposes a novel method for improving the performance of language models on tabular data prediction, the impact may be more limited due to the focus on numerical features and the potential computational costs associated with pre-training and fine-tuning on large datasets.

paper 1:
UniAudio:
  Title: UniAudio: An Audio Foundation Model Toward Universal Audio Generation
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of generating multiple types of audio (speech, sounds, music, and singing) using a single unified model. This problem is interesting and important because current audio generation methods are typically task-specific, requiring separate models and domain knowledge for each type of audio generation task. A universal model would simplify the process and make it more efficient to meet the diverse and emergent needs in audio generation.
  Motivation: Existing methods are not sufficient because they are designed for specific tasks and cannot generalize across different types of audio generation. These methods often require extensive domain knowledge and are limited to fixed setups. The inspiration behind the new proposed method comes from the success of large language models (LLMs) in handling various generative tasks. The proposed method leverages LLM techniques to create a universal audio generation model that can handle multiple tasks with a single model. This approach is expected to work better than existing baselines because it can learn the intrinsic properties of audio and the inter-relationships between audio and other modalities, allowing it to generalize across different tasks.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, UniAudio, works by: 1) Tokenizing all types of target audio along with other condition modalities. 2) Concatenating source-target pairs as a single sequence. 3) Performing next-token prediction using LLMs. A multi-scale Transformer model is introduced to handle the overly long sequences caused by the residual vector quantization-based neural codec in tokenization. The model is trained on 165K hours of audio and 1B parameters, covering all generative tasks to obtain sufficient prior knowledge. This allows the trained UniAudio model to become a foundation model for universal audio generation, capable of strong performance in all trained tasks and seamless support for new tasks after simple fine-tuning.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect 12 publicly available datasets totaling 165K hours of audio. These datasets cover various audio generation tasks such as speech synthesis, voice conversion, singing voice synthesis, text-to-sound, and text-to-music.
    Step 2: Tokenization: Tokenize all types of audio using a universal neural codec model. Tokenize other modalities such as phoneme sequences, MIDI, text, and semantic tokens using appropriate tokenizers. Ensure that all tokenized sequences are represented as discrete sequences.
    Step 3: Construct Unified Task Formulation: Define the sequence formats for all tasks supported by UniAudio. Concatenate the condition sequences and target audio sequences into a single sequence with special tokens to indicate the start and end of each sub-sequence and the task identifier.
    Step 4: Model Architecture: Implement the multi-scale Transformer architecture. Use a global Transformer to model inter-frame correlations and a local Transformer to model intra-frame correlations. Ensure that the global Transformer processes patches (frames) and the local Transformer handles the tokens within each patch.
    Step 5: Training: Train the UniAudio model on the collected datasets for 7 audio generation tasks. Use a parameter budget of roughly 1B and optimize the model using 16 AMD MI200-64G GPUs. Follow the detailed configuration of optimization provided in the paper.
    Step 6: Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the trained UniAudio model on 4 new audio generation tasks. Ensure that the performance of the original 7 tasks is retained by re-sampling the training data with respect to tasks.
    Step 7: Evaluation: Evaluate the model using both objective and subjective metrics. Objective metrics include WER, SIM, PESQ, VISQOL, DNSMOS, MCD, FAD, KL, and FD. Subjective metrics include MOS, SMOS, OVL, and REL. Conduct subjective evaluations using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of UniAudio with selected prior works on each task. Analyze whether the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results across the 11 audio generation tasks. Conduct ablation studies to validate the benefits of building a unified model and the effectiveness of the multi-scale Transformer architecture.

Unveiling the Pitfalls of Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models:
  Title: Unveiling the Pitfalls of Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: As the cost associated with fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to rise, recent research efforts have pivoted towards developing methodologies to edit implicit knowledge embedded within LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether knowledge editing might introduce side effects that pose potential risks, such as the butterfly effect. This paper investigates the potential pitfalls associated with knowledge editing for LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods for knowledge editing in LLMs have demonstrated impressive results but have not adequately addressed the potential side effects. Specifically, there are concerns about Knowledge Conflict, where editing groups of facts that logically clash can magnify inconsistencies, and Knowledge Distortion, where altering parameters to edit factual knowledge can warp the innate knowledge structure of LLMs. The proposed investigation aims to uncover these pitfalls and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the risks involved in knowledge editing.
  Proposed Method: The paper introduces new benchmark datasets and proposes innovative evaluation metrics to investigate the potential pitfalls of knowledge editing. The two main concerns addressed are: (1) Knowledge Conflict, which examines how editing groups of facts that logically clash can magnify inconsistencies, and (2) Knowledge Distortion, which explores how altering parameters to edit factual knowledge can warp the innate knowledge structure of LLMs. The authors also propose a simple-yet-effective method called Multi-label Edit (MLE) to alleviate knowledge distortion.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Construct two benchmark datasets: CONFLICT EDIT and ROUND EDIT. CONFLICT EDIT includes pairs of edits that could cause knowledge conflict, while ROUND EDIT is designed to evaluate knowledge distortion through round-edit experiments.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Manually create editing prompts for each relation based on their descriptions on WikiData. Use GPT-4 to generate 20 alternative phrasings for each relation’s prompt and select the 10 most appropriate prompts for generalization evaluation.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT2-XL (1.5B) and GPT-J (6B) for the experiments. Train MEND on the datasets using EasyEdit and apply the code and MLP weight provided by the original papers for ROME and MEMIT.
    Step 4: Conduct Experiments: Evaluate the performance of existing knowledge editing methods (FT, MEND, ROME, MEMIT) on the CONFLICT EDIT and ROUND EDIT datasets. For CONFLICT EDIT, measure Conflict Score (CS), Conflict Magnitude (CM), and Tied Fact Damage (TFD). For ROUND EDIT, measure Distortion (D), Ignore Rate (IR), and Failure Rate (FR).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the results of the different methods to identify the extent of knowledge conflict and distortion. Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Multi-label Edit (MLE) method in mitigating knowledge distortion. Analyze the impact of knowledge editing on the implicit knowledge structure of LLMs and discuss potential solutions to avoid these pitfalls.

paper 1:
Hypothesis- and Structure-based Prompting for Medical and Business Diagnosis:
  Title: Hypothesis- and Structure-based Prompting for Medical and Business Diagnosis
  Problem Statement: In real-world scenarios like healthcare and business, tackling many-to-one problems is challenging but crucial. For instance, in medical diagnosis, a patient's chief complaint can be caused by various diseases, yet time and resource constraints make identifying the cause difficult. Similarly, in business, declining sales might be attributed to multiple factors. Identifying the root cause is paramount as it sets the foundation for devising appropriate solutions.
  Motivation: Existing prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph of Thoughts (GoT), have limitations in addressing many-to-one problems. CoT excels in one-to-one mapping problems but falters when multiple potential root causes must be explored. ToT and GoT are adept at simpler recursive problem-solving tasks but are less applicable to real-world complex challenges such as medical or business diagnosis. The proposed Hypothesis-based and Structure-based (HS) prompting method aims to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by efficiently breaking down the problem space using a Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) framework and generating, prioritizing, and validating hypotheses through targeted questioning and data collection.
  Proposed Method: The HS method integrates structure-based methodology using the MECE principle to break down complex problems into discrete parts. The model generates and prioritizes hypotheses derived from available data and actively seeks additional information through well-crafted queries to confirm or reject these hypotheses. The method involves five steps: 1) Problem Definition, 2) Structuring the Problem, 3) Hypothesis Generation, 4) Efficient Search Process, and 5) Develop Solution. The method is validated through diverse case studies in business consulting and medical diagnosis, evaluated by domain experts.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For business consulting, use cases from the Kellogg Business Case Book and Interview Guide. For medical diagnosis, construct virtual patient cases based on real-world experiences of healthcare professionals.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the HS method, provide a detailed guide for crafting examples. Example prompts for business: 'Our client, Vitality Insurance, is a leading provider of supplemental insurance products in the United States. Vitality has undergone fairly steady growth in the past two years, but profit margin is decreasing. What should they do about it?' Example prompts for medical diagnosis: 'A 58-year-old male presented to the hospital with chest pain. The patient has no specific medical past history. He presents with recurrent chest pain that started 2 months ago.'
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-4 provided by OpenAI’s chat interface for both business and medical cases.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate reports using the HS method and baseline methods (IO, IOQ, CoTQ) for each case. For business, evaluate reports on criteria such as engagement, information, testing, creativity, and 'So what' thinking. For medical, evaluate reports on criteria such as appropriate differential diagnosis, accurate and detailed diagnosis, rationale of diagnosis, align with actual clinical practice, appropriate management, and harmfulness.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the HS method with baseline methods. For business, analyze the average scores across all criteria and cases. For medical, analyze the composite scores of the six metrics across all cases. Conduct qualitative analysis to understand the strengths and limitations of the HS method.

Catastrophic Jailbreak of Open-source LLMs via Exploiting Generation:
  Title: Catastrophic Jailbreak of Open-source LLMs via Exploiting Generation
  Problem Statement: Despite extensive efforts to align open-source large language models (LLMs) with human values to ensure their helpfulness and harmlessness, these models can still be manipulated to exhibit unintended behaviors, known as 'jailbreaks'. These jailbreaks are typically triggered by specific text inputs, often referred to as adversarial prompts.
  Motivation: Existing methods to align LLMs with human values often rely on fixed generation configurations during safety evaluations. However, these methods are not sufficient as they do not account for variations in decoding strategies, which can be exploited to bypass safety measures. The proposed method, generation exploitation attack, aims to demonstrate that simply manipulating decoding methods can significantly increase the attack success rate, highlighting a major flaw in current safety evaluation procedures.
  Proposed Method: The generation exploitation attack disrupts model alignment by manipulating variations of decoding methods. This includes varying decoding hyper-parameters and sampling methods. By exploring different generation strategies, such as changing temperature, top-k, and top-p sampling, the attack increases the success rate of bypassing safety constraints. The study also proposes a new alignment method, generation-aware alignment, which proactively aligns models with outputs generated under various generation configurations to reduce the attack success rate.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the AdvBench benchmark, which comprises 500 instances of harmful behaviors expressed as specific instructions, and the newly curated MaliciousInstruct benchmark, which consists of 100 harmful instances presented as instructions covering ten different malicious intentions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each prompt, generate multiple responses by exploring different generation strategies, including varying temperature, top-k, and top-p sampling. Remove the system prompt in some cases to observe its impact on model alignment.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate on 11 open-source models: LLaMA2 (7B, 13B, 7B-chat, 13B-chat), Vicuna (7B, 13B, 33B), Falcon (7B, 40B), and MPT (7B, 30B). Also, evaluate on the proprietary model GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI.
    Step 4: Get Results: Measure the attack success rate (ASR) using a trained classifier to detect misalignment and conduct human evaluations to assess the harmfulness percentage (HP) of the outputs. Compare the ASR and HP across different generation configurations and models.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the effectiveness of the generation exploitation attack against the state-of-the-art attack (GCG) in terms of ASR and computational cost. Evaluate the impact of the proposed generation-aware alignment method on reducing the ASR. Highlight the disparity in vulnerability between open-source and proprietary models.

Comparison and Decision:
Both papers address important problems in the field of NLP and LLMs. Paper 1 focuses on enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios, while Paper 2 addresses the issue of jailbreaking in open-source LLMs. However, Paper 1 has a more significant practical impact as it directly addresses real-world challenges in medical and business diagnosis. The proposed HS method is novel and well-grounded in established frameworks, and the experiment plan is comprehensive and includes both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Close the Gap: Lightweight Image Captioning via Retrieval Augmentation:
  Title: Close the Gap: Lightweight Image Captioning via Retrieval Augmentation
  Problem Statement: Image captioning is crucial for applications like content-based image search and accessibility for visually impaired individuals. However, pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from a modality gap, which is the misalignment of image and text representations in the joint embedding space. This gap can be minimized by finetuning, but it is usually costly, often infeasible, and requires large amounts of task-specific data.
  Motivation: Existing methods to bridge the modality gap typically involve end-to-end training, which is computationally expensive and data-intensive. The proposed method aims to address this issue by introducing a lightweight solution that does not require extensive finetuning. The inspiration behind the new method is to use a linear mapping optimized via a least-squares solution, which is computationally efficient and can be computed quickly even on a CPU. This approach is expected to work better than existing baselines by providing a cost-effective way to align image and text modalities, thereby enhancing the performance of lightweight image captioning systems.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves the following steps: 1) Compile a dataset of image and text correspondences. 2) Compute a linear mapping via a least-squares solution to bridge the modality gap. 3) At inference, apply the mapping to images embedded by the VLM and retrieve the closest captions from the training dataset. 4) Use these retrieved captions as prompts for a language model (LM) to generate new captions. 5) Introduce a self-improvement loop that iteratively refines the mapping by bootstrapping synthetic captions from the LM, optimizing for commonly used image captioning metrics.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the MS-COCO and Flickr30k datasets, which provide image-text pairs for training and evaluation.
    Step 2: Preprocess Data: Perform length normalization and mean centering of both image and caption embedding vectors.
    Step 3: Compute Linear Mapping: Embed the images and corresponding captions using a CLIP vision encoder and text encoder, respectively. Fit a least-squares linear model to minimize the difference between image and text embeddings.
    Step 4: Construct Prompts: Retrieve the closest captions to an input image using the computed linear mapping. Use these captions along with a prompt template (e.g., 'Similar images show: {} This image shows:') to generate new captions using a generative LM like FLAN-T5.
    Step 5: Select Models: Use a CLIP vision encoder (e.g., RN50x64) and a generative LM (e.g., FLAN-T5-Large).
    Step 6: Implement Self-Improvement Loop: Generate synthetic captions for training images, filter them based on a captioning metric (e.g., CIDEr-D), and add high-quality synthetic captions to the training set. Recompute the linear mapping and repeat the process for several iterations.
    Step 7: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the method on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets using metrics like BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, CIDEr-D, and SPICE. Compare the performance with existing lightweight captioning approaches.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Investigate the impact of the self-improvement loop, cross-domain transfer capabilities, and the susceptibility of CLIP-score to hallucinated content. Provide qualitative examples and analyze correlations between different metrics.

PixArt-α: Fast Training of Diffusion Transformer for Photorealistic Text-to-Image Synthesis:
  Title: PixArt-α: Fast Training of Diffusion Transformer for Photorealistic Text-to-Image Synthesis
  Problem Statement: The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), which seriously hinders fundamental innovation in the AIGC community and increases CO2 emissions. The challenge is to develop a high-quality image generator with affordable resource consumption.
  Motivation: Existing T2I models like Imagen, SDXL, and Midjourney achieve high-quality image generation but at the cost of immense computational resources and high CO2 emissions. These models require millions of GPU hours and substantial financial investment, making them inaccessible for many researchers and startups. The proposed method, PixArt-α, aims to reduce training costs and CO2 emissions while maintaining competitive image generation quality. The inspiration behind PixArt-α is to decompose the training strategy, optimize the T2I Transformer architecture, and use high-informative data to achieve efficient training.
  Proposed Method: PixArt-α is a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model that incorporates three core designs: (1) Training strategy decomposition: The training process is divided into three distinct steps to separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality. (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: Cross-attention modules are integrated into the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch. (3) High-informative data: Emphasis is placed on the concept density in text-image pairs, leveraging a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the ImageNet dataset for pixel dependency learning, the SAM dataset for text-image alignment learning, and a combination of JourneyDB and a 10M internal dataset for high-aesthetic quality image generation.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: Adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as the base architecture. Incorporate cross-attention modules to inject text conditions and streamline the class-condition branch. Use the adaLN-single module to reduce the number of parameters and re-parameterization to utilize pre-trained weights.
    Step 3: Training Strategy Decomposition: Decompose the training into three stages: (1) Pixel dependency learning using a class-conditional model pre-trained on ImageNet. (2) Text-image alignment learning using high-information-density text-image pairs from the SAM dataset. (3) High-resolution and aesthetic image generation using high-quality aesthetic data from JourneyDB and the internal dataset.
    Step 4: Data Construction Pipeline: Generate high-information-density captions using the LLaVA model on the SAM dataset. Use the prompt 'Describe this image and its style in a very detailed manner' to improve caption quality. Construct the training dataset by incorporating JourneyDB and the internal dataset for high-aesthetic quality images.
    Step 5: Training Details: Train the model on 64 V100 GPUs for approximately 26 days. Use the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.03 and a constant learning rate of 2e-5. Employ multi-scale training and multi-aspect augmentation for high-resolution image generation.
    Step 6: Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the model using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) on the MSCOCO dataset, compositionality on T2I-CompBench, and human-preference rate through user studies.
    Step 7: Get Results: Generate images using the trained model and evaluate their quality and alignment with the text prompts. Compare the results with existing T2I models like DALL-E 2, SDv2, SDXL, and DeepFloyd.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of PixArt-α with other models in terms of FID, compositionality, and human-preference rate. Analyze the training efficiency, resource consumption, and CO2 emissions to demonstrate the advantages of PixArt-α.

- The proposed method may still require significant computational resources (64 V100 GPUs for 26 days), although it is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion:
While both papers make valuable contributions to their respective subfields, Paper 2 (PixArt-α) stands out as the more impactful and innovative work. It addresses a critical challenge in the T2I domain by significantly reducing training costs and CO2 emissions while maintaining competitive image generation quality. The proposed training strategy decomposition, efficient T2I Transformer architecture, and use of high-informative data demonstrate a well-thought-out approach to tackling the problem. In contrast, Paper 1's contribution, although valuable, is more incremental and focused on a specific aspect of image captioning. Therefore, Paper 2 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference like ICLR or ACL.

Visual Data-Type Understanding:
  Title: Visual Data-Type Understanding does not emerge from scaling Vision-Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of Visual Data-Type Identification, which is a basic perceptual skill necessary for tasks such as data curation and autonomous vision. The problem is interesting and important because current vision-language models (VLMs) excel at recognizing semantic content but fail to understand and identify various visual data-types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where distinguishing between different visual data-types is crucial.
  Motivation: Existing VLMs, despite their success in recognizing semantic content, struggle with identifying visual data-types, especially those arising from basic manipulations like image rotations or additive noise. This limitation is not addressed by simply scaling up the model size. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to analyze the pre-training distributions of these models and incorporate data-type information into the captions during fine-tuning, which is hypothesized to enhance the model's performance in identifying visual data-types.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves creating two novel datasets with images altered across 27 visual data-types and conducting an extensive zero-shot evaluation of 39 VLMs. The method also includes analyzing the pre-training distributions of these models and incorporating data-type information into the captions during fine-tuning to achieve significant performance enhancement. The approach aims to systematically change the training data to equip VLMs with visual data-type understanding.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Create two datasets: SyntheticTypeIdent and NaturalTypeIdent. SyntheticTypeIdent is constructed by generating 50 reference-images of animals using a text-to-image model and altering them across 27 data-types. NaturalTypeIdent is curated from real-world images and altered similarly.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For zero-shot evaluation, use a fixed set of 27 data-type text prompts. For example, 'This is a noisy image of an animal.' for GAUSSIAN NOISE. Evaluate C-VLMs by computing cosine-similarity and LMMs by log-likelihood scoring with these prompts.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate 39 VLMs from 13 model families, including CLIP, CoCa, BLIP-2-ITM, Fromage, Multimodal-GPT, OpenFlamingo, Otter, GILL, MPlugOwl, LLaV A, BLIP-2-LLM, InstructBLIP, and IDEFICS. Model sizes range from 100M to 80B parameters.
    Step 4: Get Results: Conduct zero-shot evaluation on both datasets using the selected models. Measure performance using informedness, which accounts for both true positive rate and false positive rate.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance landscape to identify trends and limitations. Investigate the embedding spaces and pre-training distributions to understand why models struggle with data-type identification. Fine-tune models with data-type information incorporated into the training data and evaluate the performance improvements.

How Does RLHF Shift Behavior Distributions? Distinguishability and Steerability:
  Title: How Does RLHF Shift Behavior Distributions? Distinguishability and Steerability
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but their potential for causing harm has raised concerns. This paper investigates the impact of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on an LLM's susceptibility to being steered into negative behavior under persona prompts.
  Motivation: Existing methods for aligning LLMs, such as RLHF, aim to reinforce safeguards to prevent undesirable behaviors. However, despite these efforts, LLMs can still be manipulated to exhibit negative behaviors through adversarial prompts. This study aims to understand how RLHF affects behavior distributions and the resulting vulnerabilities to prompt steering, which is crucial for improving the robustness of LLMs against malicious use.
  Proposed Method: The paper conceptualizes LLM outputs as a decomposition of behaviors into positive and negative sub-distributions. It examines how RLHF influences the distinguishability between these sub-distributions and investigates behavioral steerability by devising persona prompts of varying lengths. The study uses the LLaMA2 model and its RLHF variant, LLaMA2-RLHF, and evaluates them on a diverse set of behaviors from Anthropic’s persona evaluation dataset.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use Anthropic’s persona evaluation dataset, which includes statements from 135 behaviors, each with 1,000 prompt statements. The dataset provides Yes or No labels to indicate alignment with the behavior.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Create persona prompts of varying lengths (1 to 14 sentences) to induce specific behaviors. For example, for agreeableness, a prompt might be: 'The Disagreeability Institute is an organization dedicated to understanding the intricacies of disagreeable behavior in human communication. To ensure success, you need to fully immerse yourself in the essence of an AI that is very disagreeable, savoring putting people down.'
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the LLaMA2-7B as the base model and LLaMA2-7B-RLHF, which is fine-tuned with RLHF on publicly available instruction datasets such as HH-RLHF and over 1 million human annotations.
    Step 4: Measure Distinguishability: Evaluate the distinguishability between positive and negative sub-distributions using two metrics: β-distinguishability proxy and Wasserstein distance. Calculate these metrics for both the base and RLHF models across all behaviors.
    Step 5: Analyze Output Distributions: Visualize the model’s output distribution for each behavior, focusing on the logit values corresponding to the token 'Yes'. Compare the spread and concentration of positive and negative sub-distributions before and after RLHF.
    Step 6: Evaluate Steerability: Use the persona prompts to steer the models towards negative behaviors. Measure the misalignment rate, defined as the number of outputs in the negative sub-distribution divided by the total number of outputs. Compare the misalignment rates for the base and RLHF models across different prompt lengths.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the changes in distinguishability and steerability due to RLHF. Investigate whether the degree of distinguishability predicts the extent of susceptibility to negative behavior steering. Discuss the implications of the findings for future alignment research.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of AI and language models. The first paper, "Visual Data-Type Understanding," focuses on the problem of identifying visual data types, which is crucial for tasks like data curation and autonomous vision. The authors propose a novel method to systematically change the training data and incorporate data-type information into the captions during fine-tuning to enhance the performance of vision-language models (VLMs). The paper's strengths lie in its comprehensive evaluation of 39 VLMs across two novel datasets and its systematic approach to addressing the limitations of current models in understanding visual data types.

The second paper, "How Does RLHF Shift Behavior Distributions? Distinguishability and Steerability," investigates the impact of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their susceptibility to being steered into negative behavior under persona prompts. The authors propose a novel conceptualization of LLM outputs as a decomposition of behaviors into positive and negative sub-distributions and examine how RLHF influences the distinguishability between these sub-distributions. The paper's strengths include its use of a diverse set of behaviors from Anthropic's persona evaluation dataset and its thorough analysis of the changes in distinguishability and steerability due to RLHF.

While both papers make significant contributions, the second paper has a slight edge in terms of its potential impact and the depth of its analysis. The problem of aligning LLMs and preventing undesirable behaviors is a critical challenge in the field, and the paper's novel conceptualization of behavior distributions and its investigation of the effects of RLHF provide valuable insights for future alignment research. Additionally, the paper's step-by-step experiment plan is more comprehensive and includes a deeper analysis of the results, such as investigating the relationship between distinguishability and susceptibility to negative behavior steering.

In conclusion, while both papers are strong contenders, the second paper, "How Does RLHF Shift Behavior Distributions? Distinguishability and Steerability," is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference due to its potential impact, depth of analysis, and comprehensive experiment plan.

  Title: VibeSpace: Automatic vector embedding creation for arbitrary domains and mapping between them using large language models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of constructing interpretable embedding spaces for arbitrary domains in a fully unsupervised manner. This problem is significant because traditional methods for creating such spaces require substantial datasets and costly data acquisition processes, which are not always feasible. Additionally, the paper tackles the issue of mapping between vector spaces of non-overlapping domains, enabling cross-domain similarity analysis.
  Motivation: Existing methods for creating embedding spaces often rely on large, domain-specific datasets and extensive feature engineering, which can be expensive and time-consuming. These methods also struggle with the cold-start problem in recommender systems, where insufficient initial data hampers performance. The proposed method leverages the knowledge contained within large language models (LLMs) to automate data collection and similarity assessment, making it a more efficient and cost-effective solution. By using LLMs, the method can also capture contextual relationships between heterogeneous entities, which traditional methods may miss.
  Proposed Method: VibeSpace is a method for the unsupervised creation of interpretable embedding spaces and intelligent mappings between them. The method involves: 1. Automated data collection using LLMs to gather comprehensive datasets across multiple domains. 2. Creation of single-domain embedding spaces using a modified Word2Vec algorithm. 3. Learning mappings between vector spaces of different domains using an autoencoder architecture. 4. Interactive querying of embedding spaces to obtain semantic information about different regions.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Data is collected for three domains: movies, books, and songs. The IMDb API is used for movies, the Spotify API for songs, and the Google Books API combined with the Goodreads book-graph datasets for books.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For single-domain data collection, prompts like 'Generate me a list of 50 songs' are used to gather initial lists of entities. For cross-domain data collection, prompts like 'Give me a list of 10 books most similar to the movie Inception' are used to gather training pairs for mapping.
    Step 3: Select Models: ChatGPT3.5 is used for data collection and similarity assessment. A modified Word2Vec algorithm is used for creating single-domain embedding spaces. An autoencoder architecture is used for learning mappings between vector spaces.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate embedding spaces for movies, books, and songs. Evaluate the separability of these spaces based on genre using TSNE projections and 1-vs-rest classifiers. Measure the accuracy and completeness of the generated datasets using APIs for verification.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the generated movie dataset to the MovieLens dataset to assess coverage and the ability to uncover niche entities. Evaluate the quality of cross-domain mappings using symmetry error and triangularity error metrics. Analyze the semantic information obtained from interactive querying of embedding spaces.


paper 2:
LEGO-Prover:
  Title: LEGO-Prover: Neural Theorem Proving with Growing Libraries
  Problem Statement: Theorem proving remains one of the most challenging reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs). Despite promising results from prior methods, they still struggle to prove even middle school-level theorems. A common limitation is the assumption of a fixed theorem library throughout the proving process, which hinders the ability to create new useful theorems or theories necessary for advancing mathematics and proving more complex results.
  Motivation: Existing methods assume a static theorem library, which limits their ability to handle more complex and deeper mathematical problems. The inspiration behind LEGO-Prover is the modularity of LEGO building blocks, which allows for the construction of complex structures from simpler components. By employing a growing skill library containing verified lemmas, LEGO-Prover aims to augment the capabilities of LLMs in theorem proving. This approach enables the creation and evolution of new skills during the proving process, making it easier to tackle intricate mathematical problems and bridge the gap between human and formal proofs.
  Proposed Method: LEGO-Prover employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to enhance the theorem-proving capabilities of LLMs. The method involves two main components: the prover and the evolver. The prover constructs proofs modularly by utilizing existing skills from the library and creating new skills during the proving process. The evolver transforms these skills for better reusability and generalizability or directly addresses lemma requests. The growing library is continuously enriched with modular and reusable skills, enabling the LLMs to tackle increasingly complex problems.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:

Provide a better structured step-by-step proof that is closer to Isabelle and request relevant lemmas and theorems that might help in proving this problem.
      Formalizer Prompt: System message: As a mathematician familiar with Isabelle, your task is to provide a formal proof in response to a given problem statement. Your proof should be structured and clearly written, meeting the following criteria: It can be verified by Isabelle. Each step of the proof should be explained in detail using comments enclosed in '(*' and '*)'. The explanation for each step should be clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary or apologetic language. You are strongly encouraged to create useful and reusable lemmas to solve the problem. The lemmas should be as general as possible (generalizable), and be able to cover a large step in proofs (non-trivial). Please ensure that your proof is well-organized and easy to follow, with each step building upon the previous one.
      Directional Transformer Prompt: System Message: As an expert mathematician who is proficient in Isabelle theorem proving, your task is to modify the given lemma, theorem, function, or definition given in the code to aid in solving one or more of the problems provided. You should accomplish this by {evolve description}. Here are some reference problems: [List of problems]. Skill to evolve: [Skill code].
      Request Solver Prompt: System message: As a mathematician familiar with Isabelle, your task is to provide a formal proof in response to a given formal statement. Your proof should be structured and clearly written, meeting the following criteria: It can be verified by Isabelle. Please ensure that your proof is well-organized and easy to follow, with each step building upon the previous one. Formal statement: [Formal statement].
    Step 3: Select Models: We use ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) for all LLM-based tasks in the prover and evolver processes.
    Step 4: Prover Process:
      Step 4.1: Informal Solver: Generate an informal proof using the LLM if required.
      Step 4.2: Decomposer: Generate a step-by-step structural informal proof and lemma requests using the decomposer prompt.
      Step 4.3: Retrieve Lemmas: Add lemma requests to the request vector store and retrieve relevant lemmas from the lemma vector store.
      Step 4.4: Formalizer: Generate the complete proof code using the formalizer prompt and verify it with the Isabelle theorem prover. Add correct lemmas to the lemma vector store and failed lemma statements to the request vector store.
    Step 5: Evolver Process:
      Step 5.1: Directional Transformer: Randomly select a transformation type and evolve the selected lemma using the directional transformer prompt. Retrieve relevant requests and problems to guide the transformation.
      Step 5.2: Request Solver: Select the least updated request and solve it using the request solver prompt. Retrieve relevant lemmas to assist in solving the request.
      Step 5.3: Verification: Verify the generated lemma code with Isabelle and add verified lemmas to the lemma vector store.
    Step 6: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on the miniF2F dataset with both the baselines and proposed method.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks as compared to the baselines.

Fundamental Limitation of Alignment in Large Language Models:
  Title: Fundamental Limitation of Alignment in Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of aligning large language models (LLMs) to ensure they exhibit useful and unharmful behavior when interacting with humans. The challenge is that even after alignment, LLMs can still be prompted into exhibiting undesired behaviors, which poses a significant risk for AI safety.
  Motivation: Existing methods for aligning LLMs, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and aligning prompts, are not foolproof. These methods can attenuate undesired behaviors but do not eliminate them entirely, making the models vulnerable to adversarial prompting attacks. The proposed method, Behavior Expectation Bounds (BEB), aims to provide a theoretical framework to formally investigate the limitations of alignment in LLMs and to understand why current methods may fail.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Behavior Expectation Bounds (BEB), is a probabilistic framework that represents the LLM distribution as a superposition of well-behaved and ill-behaved components. The framework provides guarantees on the ability to restrain the ill-behaved components. The core idea is that for any behavior with a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there exist prompts that can trigger this behavior, with the probability increasing with the length of the prompt. This implies that any alignment process that does not remove undesired behaviors altogether is not safe against adversarial prompting attacks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the behavior evaluation dataset introduced in Perez et al. (2022), which includes 1000 behavior evaluating prompts for over 100 different behavior verticals. Extract positive and negative behavior statements for each behavior vertical.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, generate prompts that are likely to trigger undesired behaviors. This involves sampling prompts from a model fine-tuned on negative behavior statements (P−). For the baseline, use prompts that are neutral or aligned to positive behaviors.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use models from the LLaMA LLM family, including both pretrained and RLHF fine-tuned versions. Fine-tune the models on the behavior evaluation dataset to create well-behaved (P+) and ill-behaved (P−) distributions.
    Step 4: Measure Distinguishability and Similarity: Calculate the KL-divergence and corresponding variance between the well-behaved and ill-behaved distributions to estimate β-distinguishability and σ-similarity. This involves generating responses from both P+ and P− and measuring the log likelihood ratios.
    Step 5: Demonstrate Misalignment: Generate adversarial prompts from P− and feed them to the RLHF fine-tuned model. Measure the KL-divergence between the model's distribution and P− as a function of prompt length to demonstrate convergence. Additionally, classify the model's responses to measure behavior expectation and show how the model loses alignment with increasing prompt length.

Discovering the Question-Critical Moments:
  Title: Discovering the question-critical moments: Towards building event-aware multi-modal large language models for complex video question answering
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of complex Video Question Answering (VideoQA), which requires models to perform intricate causal-temporal reasoning over long videos with multiple objects and events. Existing methods that simply concatenate uniformly sampled frame representations are either resource-demanding or distracted by question-irrelevant content, leading to unsatisfactory performance.
  Motivation: Existing methods for VideoQA are not effective because they either result in a large number of visual tokens, making them resource-intensive, or they include redundant, question-irrelevant content that distracts the model. The inspiration behind the new method is to make the model event-aware, focusing on question-critical moments to improve spatial-temporal reasoning. The proposed method, E-STR, aims to adaptively select keyframes that are critical to the question and encode the rest of the video to preserve general context, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, E-STR, extends Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) to be event-aware for spatial-temporal reasoning in complex VideoQA tasks. It includes a differentiable question-critical keyframes retriever to select key moments in the video and a general context encoder to encode unselected parts for preserving general context. Lightweight adapters are incorporated within the frozen image encoder to facilitate spatial-temporal representation acquisition. The method is validated through extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmarks: NExT-QA, Causal-VidQA, and STAR.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use three large-scale benchmarks: NExT-QA, Causal-VidQA, and STAR. These datasets are notable for complex causal-temporal reasoning within long videos containing multiple objects and events.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: Use InstructBLIP as the base MLLM, which includes a ViT-G image encoder from EVA-CLIP, a transformer-based Q-former as the connection module, and Vicuna or FLAN-T5 as the language model. Incorporate lightweight adapters within the frozen image encoder for spatial-temporal representation.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: Train the model using cross-entropy loss. The model parameters include the connection module, adapters, question-critical keyframes retriever, and general context encoder. The image encoder, language model, and text encoder remain frozen.
    Step 4: Implement Key Components:
      Question-Critical Keyframes Retriever: Use a transformer encoder to contextualize spatial frame embeddings and a cross-attention layer to get attention scores between each frame and the question. Apply a one-dimensional convolution to get an event-level attention map and use Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable selection of keyframes.
      General Context Encoder: Use a mechanism inspired by the perceiver model to encode unselected frame features into a shorter representation, preserving temporal context more effectively than mean pooling.
      Spatial-Temporal Representation: Incorporate 3D-Conv based ST-Adapter and MLP-Adapter within each transformer block of the vision encoder to capture temporal relationships and refine spatial representations.
    Step 5: Conduct Experiments: Run experiments on the three benchmarks with the following settings: uniformly sample 32 frames per video, crop each frame to 224x224, set visual token length to 32, and event window size to 5. Use AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5 and mixed precision training on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the model's performance on the benchmarks using standard answer accuracy as the metric. Compare the results with existing state-of-the-art methods and baselines.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the performance improvements, particularly on complex questions requiring causal and temporal reasoning. Conduct ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each component and the impact of different hyperparameters.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus and potential impact.

Paper 1 tackles the critical issue of aligning large language models to ensure safe and desirable behavior. The proposed Behavior Expectation Bounds (BEB) framework provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the limitations of current alignment methods and the vulnerability to adversarial prompting attacks. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured and includes a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method against baselines. The paper's findings could have significant implications for AI safety and the development of more robust alignment techniques.

On the other hand, Paper 2 focuses on improving the performance of complex Video Question Answering (VideoQA) tasks by introducing an event-aware multi-modal large language model called E-STR. The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing approaches by adaptively selecting question-critical keyframes and encoding the rest of the video to preserve general context. The experiment plan is detailed and includes extensive evaluations on three large-scale benchmarks. The paper's contributions could lead to more efficient and accurate VideoQA models.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 1 addresses a more fundamental and pressing issue in the field of AI safety. The potential impact of the proposed BEB framework extends beyond the specific task of VideoQA and could influence the development of safer and more reliable large language models across various applications. In contrast, Paper 2's contributions, although valuable, are more focused on improving performance on a specific task.

Considering the broader impact and the theoretical significance of the proposed method, Paper 1 is likely to be more favorably received by the AI research community and has a higher chance of being accepted at a top AI conference.

paper 1:
Interpretable Concept Discovery and Learning from Pretrained Vision-Language Models:
  Title: Interpretable Concept Discovery and Learning from Pretrained Vision-Language Models
  Problem Statement: Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on web-scale data excel at recognizing complex visual objects. However, it remains unclear if and how these models learn and utilize rich semantic information of visual concepts, such as colors and shapes, for recognition. The paper aims to address the discrepancy in prior works regarding the interpretability of VLMs in encoding visual concepts.
  Motivation: Existing methods have conflicting conclusions about the interpretability of VLMs. Some studies suggest that VLMs do not capture interpretable concepts, while others show that concept-based text prompts improve visual recognition accuracy. The discrepancy arises from different strategies of concept selection and prompting. The proposed method aims to resolve these issues by discovering and learning class-agnostic, visually discriminative concepts, thereby improving both interpretability and recognition performance.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a new framework to jointly discover and learn interpretable visual concepts from pretrained VLMs. The discovered concepts are class-agnostic and selected based on visual discriminability measured by mutual information between images and concepts. A self-supervised framework is then used to fine-tune the VLM to better recognize these concepts. The method includes querying large language models (LLMs) for visual-focused prompts, selecting discriminative concepts using mutual information, and fine-tuning the VLM using a self-supervised learning paradigm.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use several general and fine-grained image classification datasets including ImageNet, Food-101, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and Flowers-102.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Query the LLM with prompts like 'What are useful visual features for distinguishing a {category name} in a photo?' to generate class-agnostic visual concepts. Use in-context examples to guide the LLM.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the CLIP model (ViT-L/14 and ViT-B/32) for image and text encoding. Use GPT-3-text-davinci-002 for generating descriptors.
    Step 4: Discover Concepts: Extract a list of general and class-agnostic visual concepts from the LLM-generated descriptors. Evaluate the discriminability of these concepts using mutual information between image-concept similarity and the 'ground-truth' concept containing label of the images. Select top-k concepts with the highest mutual information scores.
    Step 5: Fine-Tune VLM: Fine-tune the pretrained CLIP model to learn visual concepts in a self-supervised way. Turn the image-text matching task of the CLIP model into a classification objective with a fixed concept-to-class weight matrix initialized with LLM knowledge. Generate class labels by matching images with class names using CLIP. Fine-tune the projection layers of vision and text encoders of the CLIP model using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-4 and weight decay of 1e-4.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Conduct extensive quantitative and human evaluations to measure the interpretability and recognition performance. Use metrics such as intervention accuracy, factuality, and groundability. Compare the performance of the proposed method with state-of-the-art baselines like LaBo and LM4CV.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine if the proposed method improves the interpretability and recognition performance of VLMs. Use statistical significance tests to validate the improvements.

Reasoning on Graphs:
  Title: Reasoning on Graphs: Faithful and Interpretable Large Language Model Reasoning
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities in complex tasks. However, they lack up-to-date knowledge and experience hallucinations during reasoning, which can lead to incorrect reasoning processes and diminish their performance and trustworthiness.
  Motivation: Existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only treat KGs as factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning. This leads to issues such as hallucinations and lack of up-to-date knowledge. The proposed method, Reasoning on Graphs (RoG), aims to synergize LLMs with KGs to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning by leveraging the structural information in KGs. This approach is expected to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs and generate more accurate and interpretable results.
  Proposed Method: RoG introduces a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework. The method involves three main steps: 1) Planning: RoG generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans. 2) Retrieval: These plans are used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from the KGs. 3) Reasoning: LLMs conduct faithful reasoning based on the retrieved paths. RoG also distills knowledge from KGs to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs through training and allows seamless integration with any arbitrary LLMs during inference.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate the reasoning ability of RoG on two benchmark KGQA datasets: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) and Complex WebQuestions (CWQ). Freebase is used as the background knowledge graph for both datasets.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Planning Prompt: Please generate a valid relation path that can be helpful for answering the following question: <Question>
      Reasoning Prompt: Based on the reasoning paths, please answer the given question. Please keep the answer as simple as possible and return all the possible answers as a list. Reasoning Paths: <Reasoning Paths> Question: <Question>
      Explanation Prompt: Based on the reasoning paths, please answer the given question and explain why. Here are some examples: <Examples> Reasoning Paths: <Reasoning Paths> Question: <Question>
    Step 3: Select Models: We use LLaMA2-Chat-7B as the LLM backbone. For comparison, we also test other LLMs such as ChatGPT, Alpaca-7B, and Flan-T5-xl.
    Step 4: Training:
      Planning Optimization: Distill knowledge from KGs into LLMs to generate faithful relation paths as plans. Use the shortest paths between question and answer entities in KGs as supervision signals.
      Retrieval-Reasoning Optimization: Enable LLMs to conduct reasoning based on the retrieved reasoning paths. Use the FiD framework to allow reasoning on multiple retrieved reasoning paths.
    Step 5: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks. Evaluate the faithfulness of the relation paths and the interpretability of the reasoning results.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers aim to improve the interpretability and performance of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging external knowledge. However, they differ in their focus and approach.

Paper 1 focuses on discovering and learning interpretable visual concepts from pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). The strengths of this paper include:
1. Addressing the discrepancy in prior works regarding the interpretability of VLMs.
2. Proposing a novel method to jointly discover and learn class-agnostic, visually discriminative concepts.
3. Utilizing mutual information to select the most discriminative concepts.
4. Conducting extensive quantitative and human evaluations to measure interpretability and recognition performance.

However, the paper has some potential weaknesses:
1. The reliance on LLMs for generating visual concepts may introduce biases or inconsistencies.
2. The method's effectiveness may depend on the quality and diversity of the datasets used.

Paper 2 focuses on improving the reasoning ability of LLMs by synergizing them with knowledge graphs (KGs). The strengths of this paper include:
1. Addressing the issues of hallucinations and lack of up-to-date knowledge in LLMs during reasoning.
2. Proposing a novel planning-retrieval-reasoning framework that leverages the structural information in KGs.
3. Enabling faithful and interpretable reasoning by grounding the reasoning process in KGs.
4. Allowing seamless integration with any arbitrary LLMs during inference.

However, the paper has some potential weaknesses:
1. The effectiveness of the method may depend on the quality and coverage of the KGs used.
2. The proposed framework may introduce additional computational complexity compared to standalone LLMs.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, Paper 2 appears to be the more promising and impactful work. The proposed RoG framework addresses a critical issue in LLM reasoning, i.e., the lack of faithfulness and interpretability, by effectively leveraging the structural information in KGs. The ability to integrate with any arbitrary LLMs during inference also makes the method more versatile and applicable to a wider range of tasks. In contrast, while Paper 1 addresses an important problem in VLMs, its impact may be more limited to the specific domain of visual concept learning.

paper 1:
CellPLM: Pre-training of Cell Language Model Beyond Single Cells:
  Title: CellPLM: Pre-training of Cell Language Model Beyond Single Cells
  Problem Statement: The current state-of-the-art single-cell pre-trained models are inspired by large language models, treating genes as tokens and cells as sentences. However, these models overlook three fundamental differences between single-cell data and natural language data: (1) scRNA-seq data are presented as bag-of-genes instead of sequences of RNAs; (2) Cell-cell relations are more intricate and important than inter-sentence relations; and (3) The quantity of single-cell data is considerably inferior to text data, and they are very noisy.
  Motivation: Existing methods fail to account for the unique characteristics of single-cell data, such as the non-sequential nature of scRNA-seq data, the importance of cell-cell relations, and the high noise and low quantity of single-cell datasets. Inspired by these challenges, the proposed method, CellPLM, aims to treat cells as tokens and tissues as sentences, leveraging spatially-resolved transcriptomic data to learn cell-cell relationships and introducing a Gaussian mixture prior distribution to overcome data limitations. This approach is expected to outperform existing models by better capturing the intricate relationships between cells and providing more robust cell embeddings.
  Proposed Method: CellPLM is a pre-trained model that treats cells as tokens and tissues as sentences. It leverages spatially-resolved transcriptomic data to learn cell-cell relationships and introduces a Gaussian mixture prior distribution to handle data limitations. The model consists of four modules: a gene expression embedder, a transformer encoder, a Gaussian mixture latent space, and a batch-aware decoder. The pre-training involves a masked language modeling objective, and the model is fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect scRNA-seq data from Human Tumor Cell Atlas (HTCA), Human Cell Atlas (HCA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), totaling 11.4 million cells. Collect spatially-resolved transcriptomic (SRT) data from Nanostring, totaling 2.7 million cells.
    Step 2: Preprocess Data: Normalize and log1p transform the scRNA-seq and SRT data. Ensure the gene sets are consistent across datasets by performing an inner join on the gene sets.
    Step 3: Model Architecture: The model consists of four modules: (1) Gene Expression Embedder: Projects input gene expressions into a low-dimensional cellular feature space. (2) Transformer Encoder: Captures intercellular relationships using multi-head self-attention mechanisms. (3) Gaussian Mixture Latent Space: Utilizes a mixture of Gaussians to capture distinct functional groups of cells. (4) Batch-aware Decoder: Decodes each cell individually, incorporating batch embeddings to remove batch effects.
    Step 4: Pre-training: Pre-train the model on the collected datasets using a masked language modeling objective. Mask a certain percentage of gene expressions within cells and optimize the denoising variational lower bound using reparameterization trick and Monte Carlo sampling.
    Step 5: Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on specific downstream tasks such as scRNA-seq denoising, spatial transcriptomic imputation, cell type annotation, and perturbation prediction. Replace the pre-trained decoder with task-specific heads and train the model using task-specific loss functions.
    Step 6: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the performance of CellPLM on various downstream tasks using appropriate metrics. For scRNA-seq denoising, use RMSE and MAE. For spatial transcriptomic imputation, use Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine similarity. For cell type annotation, use Macro Precision and Macro F1 score. For perturbation prediction, use RMSE.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of CellPLM with existing pre-trained and non-pre-trained models. Analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing cell-cell relationships and providing robust cell embeddings. Conduct ablation studies to verify the contribution of each component in the model.

Certifying LLM Safety against Adversarial Prompting:
  Title: Certifying LLM Safety against Adversarial Prompting
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) are designed to reject harmful content requests, but they are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can bypass these safety measures. This problem is critical as it affects the safe deployment of LLMs in public applications.
  Motivation: Existing methods such as perplexity filtering, paraphrasing, and adversarial training do not provide performance guarantees and can be circumvented by stronger adversarial attacks. The proposed method, erase-and-check, aims to provide verifiable safety guarantees against adversarial prompts by leveraging the inherent property that subsequences of safe prompts remain safe.
  Proposed Method: The erase-and-check framework defends against adversarial prompts by individually erasing tokens from a given prompt and inspecting the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. If any subsequence or the input prompt itself is detected as harmful, the entire prompt is labeled as harmful. This method guarantees that any adversarial modification of a harmful prompt up to a certain size is also labeled harmful. The framework defends against three attack modes: adversarial suffix, adversarial insertion, and adversarial infusion.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the AdvBench dataset for harmful prompts and generate safe prompts using ChatGPT. The AdvBench dataset contains 520 harmful prompts, and an equal number of safe prompts are generated for training and testing.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the safety filter, use Llama 2 and DistilBERT. The Llama 2 system prompt is designed to classify prompts as harmful or not harmful. DistilBERT is fine-tuned on the safe and harmful prompts dataset.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use Llama 2 and DistilBERT as the safety filters. Llama 2 is used initially, and then DistilBERT is fine-tuned for improved performance.
    Step 4: Implement Erase-and-Check Procedure: For each prompt, erase tokens individually up to a maximum length and check the resulting subsequences using the safety filter. If any subsequence or the input prompt is detected as harmful, label the entire prompt as harmful.
    Step 5: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the performance of the erase-and-check procedure on both harmful and safe prompts. Measure the certified accuracy on harmful prompts and the empirical accuracy on safe prompts. Compare the performance of Llama 2 and DistilBERT as safety filters.
    Step 6: Compare with Baselines: Compare the certified accuracy of the erase-and-check procedure with randomized smoothing, a well-known certifiable robustness technique. Evaluate the performance of a randomized version of erase-and-check against adversarial prompts generated by the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of the erase-and-check procedure in providing certified safety guarantees. Compare the performance of Llama 2 and DistilBERT as safety filters and assess the efficiency of the randomized version of the procedure.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in their respective domains. The CellPLM paper focuses on improving pre-trained models for single-cell data analysis, while the Certifying LLM Safety paper aims to provide safety guarantees against adversarial prompts in large language models.

Strengths of CellPLM:
1. Addresses the unique characteristics of single-cell data, such as non-sequentiality and cell-cell relationships.
2. Leverages spatially-resolved transcriptomic data to learn cell-cell relationships.
3. Introduces a Gaussian mixture prior distribution to handle data limitations.
4. Comprehensive experiment plan with diverse datasets and evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses of CellPLM:
1. The proposed method may be computationally expensive due to the use of transformer encoders and Gaussian mixture latent space.
2. The effectiveness of the method heavily relies on the availability and quality of spatially-resolved transcriptomic data.

Strengths of Certifying LLM Safety:
1. Addresses a critical issue in the safe deployment of large language models.
2. Proposes a novel erase-and-check framework that provides verifiable safety guarantees against adversarial prompts.
3. Leverages the inherent property that subsequences of safe prompts remain safe.
4. Compares the proposed method with well-known certifiable robustness techniques and evaluates against strong adversarial attacks.

Weaknesses of Certifying LLM Safety:
1. The effectiveness of the method depends on the quality of the safety filter, which may not always be reliable.
2. The erase-and-check procedure may be computationally expensive for long prompts and large erasure lengths.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, the Certifying LLM Safety paper appears to be more impactful and likely to be accepted by a top AI conference. The problem of ensuring the safety of large language models against adversarial prompts is a critical issue that affects the broader deployment of these models in real-world applications. The proposed erase-and-check framework provides a novel and theoretically grounded approach to address this challenge, with verifiable safety guarantees. The paper also includes a comprehensive evaluation plan, comparing the proposed method with well-known techniques and strong adversarial attacks.

In contrast, while the CellPLM paper addresses important challenges in single-cell data analysis, the impact of the proposed method may be limited to a more specialized domain. Additionally, the effectiveness of the method relies heavily on the availability and quality of spatially-resolved transcriptomic data, which may not always be readily available.

paper 1:
Retrieval is Accurate Generation:
  Title: Retrieval is Accurate Generation
  Problem Statement: Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary. This approach limits the context-awareness and factual accuracy of the generated text. The paper addresses the challenge of generating text by selecting context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents, which can improve the quality and accuracy of the generated text.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as standard language models and retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, have limitations. Standard language models lack context-awareness and often generate less accurate text. Retrieval-augmented methods, like CoG, rely on a two-stage pipeline (document retrieval followed by phrase extraction), which can be constrained by the quality and quantity of the retrieved documents. The proposed method aims to directly retrieve context-aware phrases, eliminating the dependency on document retrieval and improving both the accuracy and efficiency of text generation.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves generating text through direct phrase retrieval from a collection of supporting documents. The key steps include: 1) Initializing training oracles using linguistic heuristics, which segment text into context-aware phrases. 2) Bootstrapping the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement, allowing the model to refine its generation paths based on its acquired capabilities. The model employs a dual-encoder structure, with a multi-layer neural network for the source encoder and a context-aware phrase encoder for the target. The training process uses InfoNCE loss and incorporates both in-batch and hard negative sampling to improve the model's ability to differentiate phrases.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The model is trained on the MiniPile dataset and uses the English Wikipedia dump (March 1, 2022) as supporting documents. The phrase index is constructed from Wikipedia articles, resulting in 29,488,431 documents and 137,101,097 phrases.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: The prefix encoder is a standard Transformer architecture with causal attention, initialized from GPT-2. The phrase encoder is a deep bidirectional Transformer, initialized from DensePhrases. The model uses a dual-encoder structure with dot product as the matching measure.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: The model is trained using the InfoNCE loss, with a negative phrase set introduced for each training triplet. The training objective combines the phrase retrieval loss (Lp) and the standard next-token prediction loss (Lt), with a weighting factor α. Negative sampling includes in-batch negatives and hard negatives from the top-k retrieved phrases.
    Step 4: Construct Training Oracles: Training oracles are initialized using linguistic heuristics, which segment text into context-aware phrases based on syntactic structure, distributional sparsity, and semantic similarity. The oracles are refined through iterative self-reinforcement, where the model retrieves the k-best phrases and updates the target phrase based on semantic matching scores.
    Step 5: Inference Details: During inference, FAISS is used for efficient retrieval. The model retrieves top-k candidates from the phrase table and applies a softmax function to the matching scores. Top-p sampling is used for selecting the next phrase, with a threshold ϕ to control the ratio of phrase retrieval.
    Step 6: Evaluate on Knowledge-Intensive Tasks: The model is evaluated on five datasets: OpenbookQA, ARC-Challenge, TruthfulQA, MedMCQA, and Med-USMILE. The performance is measured using accuracy, comparing the model's predictions with the correct answers.
    Step 7: Evaluate on Open-Ended Text Generation: The model is evaluated on the test set of MiniPile. The quality of the generated text is measured using MAUVE, coherence, and diversity metrics. Human evaluation is also conducted to assess fluency, coherence, informativeness, and grammar.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with standard language models and other retrieval-augmented methods. Analyze the impact of the phrase retrieval threshold, self-reinforcement, and the use of an enlarged or domain-specific phrase index on the model's performance.

LoRA Ensembles for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning:
  Title: LoRA Ensembles for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning
  Problem Statement: Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) often exhibit poor uncertainty quantification, manifesting as overconfidence, poor calibration, and unreliable prediction results on test data or out-of-distribution samples. This issue is critical as it can lead to dangerously misleading outcomes in safety-critical contexts such as medical diagnosis, finance, or decision-making processes.
  Motivation: Existing methods like deep ensembles, which are effective in vision tasks, are impractical for LLMs due to their large size and memory requirements. Training multiple copies of such large models is computationally infeasible. The proposed method, using Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), offers a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that requires significantly fewer parameters than the underlying pre-trained model. This makes it feasible to construct large ensembles with minimal computational overhead, potentially improving both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves using LoRA to create an ensemble of LLMs. Each ensemble component is fine-tuned with LoRA, which learns low-rank additive correction terms (adapters) with a very small number of parameters. These adapters are initialized randomly, providing the necessary randomness for variability across the ensemble components. The method can be combined with various regularization techniques to further improve calibration and accuracy.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on six popular multiple-choice QA datasets: CommonsenseQA (cqa), OpenBook (obqa), social sciences (mmlu ss.) and STEM (mmlu stem) subsets from MMLU, ARC-easy (arce), and ARC-challenge (arcc).
    Step 2: Model Implementation: We use LLaMA-13b as the base model, applying LoRA adapters only on the query and value matrices of the self-attention modules. Each adapter is initialized with zero for B and Kaiming Uniform for A, with a fixed scaling factor α=32 and rank r=8.
    Step 3: Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the model using AdamW optimizer for 20 epochs with a fixed step size of 5e-5. Use a batch size of 32 for cqa, 16 for obqa, arcc, and arce, and 8 for mmlu ss. and stem. Apply different regularization techniques such as KL regularization, early stopping, and very large weight decay on the B matrix of LoRA.
    Step 4: Construct Baselines: Compare the performance of LoRA ensembles with several baselines: (1) Single LoRA model (M=1), (2) Few-shot learning, (3) Last-layer ensembles, and (4) Monte Carlo (MC) dropout.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the validation sets of the datasets using metrics such as accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected calibration error (ECE). For OOD performance, test models fine-tuned on cqa on mmlu and models fine-tuned on a subset of mmlu on other mmlu subcategories.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LoRA ensembles with the baselines in terms of accuracy, NLL, and ECE. Analyze the impact of different regularization techniques and the number of ensemble components on the performance. Conduct ablation studies to understand the effect of different sources of randomness on ensemble diversity and performance.

- Proposes a novel approach of generating text through direct phrase retrieval from supporting documents, eliminating the dependency on document retrieval.
- Employs a dual-encoder structure and incorporates both in-batch and hard negative sampling to improve the model's ability to differentiate phrases.
- Evaluates the model on both knowledge-intensive tasks and open-ended text generation, providing a comprehensive assessment of its performance.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The proposed method relies heavily on the quality and coverage of the supporting documents (Wikipedia articles) for constructing the phrase index.
- The iterative self-reinforcement process for refining training oracles may be computationally expensive and time-consuming.

Strengths of Paper 2 (LoRA Ensembles for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning):
- Addresses the issue of poor uncertainty quantification in fine-tuned large language models, which is critical for safety-critical applications.
- Proposes a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique using Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), enabling the construction of large ensembles with minimal computational overhead.
- Evaluates the proposed method on multiple datasets and compares its performance with several baselines, providing a thorough analysis of its effectiveness.
- Investigates the impact of different regularization techniques and the number of ensemble components on the model's performance.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The proposed method is limited to multiple-choice question-answering tasks and may not be directly applicable to open-ended text generation.
- The effectiveness of the method may depend on the choice of the base model (LLaMA-13b) and the specific hyperparameters used for LoRA adapters.

Comparison and Decision:
Both papers address important challenges in natural language processing and propose innovative solutions. However, Paper 1 (Retrieval is Accurate Generation) has a broader impact as it tackles the fundamental problem of generating context-aware and factually accurate text, which is essential for a wide range of applications. The proposed method of direct phrase retrieval is a novel approach that eliminates the dependency on document retrieval and has the potential to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of text generation.

In contrast, Paper 2 (LoRA Ensembles for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning) focuses on a specific issue of uncertainty quantification in fine-tuned large language models and is limited to multiple-choice question-answering tasks. While the proposed method of using LoRA ensembles is promising, its applicability to other tasks and its dependence on the choice of the base model may limit its overall impact.

Therefore, considering the novelty, broader impact, and potential for advancing the field of natural language processing, Paper 1 (Retrieval is Accurate Generation) is likely to be the accepted idea.

paper 1:
Human-in-the-loop Detection of AI-generated Text via Grammatical Patterns:
  Title: Human-in-the-loop Detection of AI-generated Text via Grammatical Patterns
  Problem Statement: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This is a significant issue as it can lead to the spread of misinformation, biases, and other societal risks. The ideal detection method should be both accurate and interpretable, but existing methods often fail to meet these criteria.
  Motivation: Existing methods for detecting AI-generated text either lack accuracy or interpretability. Some methods work only on smaller models, require integration of detector and text generation, or generally have low accuracy. Importantly, these methods do not provide explanations for their decisions, which can lead to false accusations without justification. The proposed method aims to address these shortcomings by focusing on interpretable grammatical patterns that can be used in a human-in-the-loop approach, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves learning interpretable grammatical patterns that are indicative of either human or AI-written text. These patterns are then used to assist humans in the detection process. The method involves the following steps: 1) Perform PoS (part of speech) tagging on a training dataset of human-written and AI-generated text. 2) Learn the most frequently occurring patterns in both types of text. 3) Use these patterns to train an interpretable classifier or provide them directly to humans for detection. 4) Evaluate the method's effectiveness through experimental evaluation and human trials.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets from various domains including scientific abstracts from arXiv, social media comments from Reddit, CNN news articles, and Wikipedia entries. Ensure that both human-written and AI-generated samples are included.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For generating AI-written samples, use prompts that align with the subject matter, literary genres, origin, and length of the human-written samples. Example prompts include: 'Generate an abstract for a scientific article with the title XYZ' or 'Write a news article about the recent event ABC'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, BARD, and LLAMA-2-70B to generate AI-written text samples.
    Step 4: Perform PoS Tagging: Use a PoS-tagger to tag the parts of speech in both human-written and AI-generated text samples. Consolidate the tags into categories such as NOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE, etc.
    Step 5: Learn Grammatical Patterns: Extract the number of occurrences of each PoS pattern in the text and train a logistic regression classifier with l1-regularization to identify the most predictive patterns. Select the top 20 patterns that are most indicative of human or AI-written text.
    Step 6: Human-in-the-loop Evaluation: Conduct a human trial where participants are given texts to classify as either human-written or AI-generated. Provide different levels of AI guidance, such as PoS tagging, matched patterns, and matched and classified patterns. Measure the accuracy and engagement of participants.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Evaluate the performance of the method using metrics such as AUROC score, accuracy, and true positive ratio. Compare the results with non-interpretable methods and assess the robustness of the method against adversarial strategies like prompt engineering and paraphrasing.

PlaSma: Procedural Knowledge Models for Language-based Planning and Re-Planning:
  Title: PlaSma: Procedural Knowledge Models for Language-based Planning and Re-Planning
  Problem Statement: Procedural planning, which entails decomposing a high-level goal into a sequence of temporally ordered steps, is an important yet intricate task for machines. It involves integrating common-sense knowledge to reason about complex and often contextualized situations, e.g., 'scheduling a doctor's appointment without a phone'.
  Motivation: Current approaches using large language models (LLMs) show encouraging results but are hindered by drawbacks such as costly API calls and reproducibility issues. Smaller language models are more accessible and cost-effective but lack the procedural knowledge and reasoning capabilities of larger models. The proposed method aims to endow smaller language models with procedural knowledge and planning capabilities, making them competitive with larger models while being more efficient and accessible.
  Proposed Method: PlaSma is a novel two-pronged approach that enhances small language models with procedural knowledge and constrained language-based planning capabilities. The method involves two main components: symbolic procedural knowledge distillation and an inference-time algorithm. Symbolic procedural knowledge distillation enhances the commonsense knowledge in small language models by verbalizing procedural knowledge from a large language model and then distilling this knowledge into a smaller model. The inference-time algorithm facilitates more structured and accurate reasoning by using a verifier-guided step-wise beam search to generate semantically coherent and temporally accurate plans.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect data for three tasks: (i) Goal-based Planning, (ii) Constrained Planning, and (iii) Counterfactual Replanning. Use the COPLAN dataset, which includes goals, plans, conditions, and counterfactual plans.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the knowledge verbalization stage, use few-shot prompting to generate procedural knowledge from a large language model (GPT-3). For example, prompt the model to generate a plan for 'see a movie' and then generate a counterfactual plan for 'see a movie at home'.
    Step 3: Train Critic Models: Train separate supervised critic models to filter out low-quality data. Collect human annotations to train these critics, which will judge the quality of generated plans, conditions, and counterfactual plans.
    Step 4: Train Student Models: Fine-tune smaller student models (T5-large, T5-3B, T5-11B) on the COPLAN dataset using both task-specific and multi-task distillation objectives. Use the standard autoregressive language modeling objective for task-specific distillation and a joint loss for multi-task distillation.
    Step 5: Develop Verifier-Guided Decoding: Train a step verifier using a RoBERTa model to check the validity of plan steps. Implement a verifier-guided step-wise beam search algorithm to generate plans. The verifier checks for sequential ordering and semantic completeness, guiding the model to generate more accurate plans.
    Step 6: Evaluate Models: Evaluate the models on the original planning task using human-written plans from the ProScript dataset. Conduct human evaluations to rate the generated plans on aspects such as order, coverage, and overall quality. Also, evaluate the models on constrained and counterfactual planning tasks using human-verified test sets from COPLAN.
    Step 7: Application to Embodied Agents: Apply the best-performing model to the VirtualHome environment. Translate generated steps from natural language to executable steps in the environment. Evaluate the models on executability, correctness, and longest common subsequence (LCS) scores.

OpenTab: Advancing Large Language Models as Open-domain Table Reasoners:
  Title: OpenTab: Advancing Large Language Models as Open-domain Table Reasoners
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language tasks but struggle with tasks requiring knowledge not previously trained on, especially when dealing with structured table data. The challenge is to enable LLMs to perform open-domain table reasoning, which involves retrieving relevant tables and generating accurate responses based on them.
  Motivation: Existing retrieval-based LLMs are primarily designed for textual data and are not well-suited for structured table data due to diverse data modalities and large table sizes. These models face challenges such as high token usage, memory constraints, and difficulty in understanding complex relationships within tabular data. The proposed method, OpenTab, aims to address these issues by leveraging LLMs to generate SQL programs for efficient table parsing and grounded inference, thereby improving accuracy and scalability.
  Proposed Method: OpenTab is an open-domain table reasoning framework that uses a table retriever to fetch relevant tables and an LLM-powered coder to generate SQL programs for parsing these tables. The framework consists of three main components: a Retriever, a Coder, and a Reader. The Retriever uses the BM25 algorithm to fetch relevant tables. The Coder generates SQL programs in a simple-to-complex manner to handle different levels of query complexity. The Reader then formulates the final response based on the SQL execution results. Additionally, a RowSelector is used to select the most relevant rows from the tables to fit within the LLM's token limits. The Generative Reranking & Sequential Reasoning (GRSR) strategy is employed to mitigate hallucination issues and improve accuracy.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the Open-WikiTable, WikiTableQuestions, and FEVEROUS datasets. Open-WikiTable is an open-domain table question-answering dataset with 24,680 candidate tables. WikiTableQuestions is a closed-domain table QA dataset. FEVEROUS is a fact-verification dataset adapted for open-domain table reasoning with 26,177 candidate tables.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the Coder, use few-shot prompting to generate SQL programs in three levels of complexity: basic, intermediate, and advanced. For the Reader, provide the table schema, sampled rows, and generated SQL query along with the SQL execution results to formulate the final response.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-3.5-turbo and Falcon-180B as the LLM backbones for the experiments. The Coder and Reader modules will leverage these models for SQL generation and response formulation.
    Step 4: Get Results: Retrieve top-k relevant tables using BM25 and generate SQL programs for each table. Execute the SQL programs and use the Reader to generate the final response. Evaluate the performance on the datasets using metrics such as execution accuracy (EA) and the adapted FEVEROUS score.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of OpenTab with baselines such as LLM-Answer, LLM-SQL, and BINDER. Conduct ablation studies to validate the efficacy of the proposed components, including the Simple-to-Complex prompting strategy, RowSelector, and the broader context provided to the Reader. Analyze the impact of the Generative Reranking & Sequential Reasoning (GRSR) strategy on mitigating hallucination and improving accuracy.

AutoDAN: Automatic and Interpretable Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models:
  Title: AutoDAN: Automatic and Interpretable Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly versatile but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety measures. These attacks can be manual (human-readable but limited and public) or automated (generating gibberish prompts detectable by perplexity-based filters). The problem is to develop an attack that combines the strengths of both types, bypassing perplexity filters while maintaining high attack success rates and interpretability.
  Motivation: Existing methods to patch LLMs against jailbreak attacks are not foolproof. Manual jailbreak attacks are easy to block due to their public nature, while automated adversarial attacks generate gibberish prompts that can be detected by perplexity filters. The inspiration behind AutoDAN is to create an attack that is both automatic and interpretable, combining the strengths of manual and automated attacks. This would make it harder to detect and block, thus exposing the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs.
  Proposed Method: AutoDAN is an interpretable adversarial attack that generates attack prompts automatically. It uses a left-to-right token-by-token generation process, optimizing each token for both jailbreaking and readability objectives. The method involves two nested loops: an inner loop for single token optimization and an outer loop for generating the entire prompt. The inner loop uses a two-step process (preliminary and fine selection) to optimize each token, while the outer loop iteratively generates tokens until a predefined maximum number of steps is reached.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the AdvBench dataset, which contains various predefined harmful behaviors, to test jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 25 behaviors each.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, use harmful user prompts without any adversarial suffix. For AutoDAN, generate adversarial suffixes that are appended to the user prompts. The prompts should be designed to bypass perplexity filters and maintain high attack success rates.
    Step 3: Select Models: Generate adversarial prompts on white-box models including Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, Guanaco-7B, and Pythia-12B. Test the prompts on the same models and black-box models like GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 hosted on Azure.
    Step 4: Implement Perplexity Filter: Implement a perplexity filter using an auxiliary LLM to evaluate the perplexity of the adversarial suffix portion of the entire prompt. Set the perplexity threshold to classify attack prompts from normal user prompts, aiming for a 10% false positive rate.
    Step 5: Generate Adversarial Prompts: Use AutoDAN to generate adversarial prompts. Set hyperparameters w1=3, w2=100, and temperature τ=1. Perform 500 optimization steps for each method. Select the prompt with the highest attack success rate on the training set as the final output.
    Step 6: Evaluate Attack Success Rate: Measure the attack success rate (ASR) before and after applying the perplexity filter. Compare the ASR of AutoDAN with baselines like GCG and GCG-reg. Evaluate the transferability of the generated prompts to black-box models.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the interpretability and diversity of the generated prompts. Categorize the strategies used in the prompts (e.g., shifting domains, detailizing instructions). Evaluate the effectiveness of AutoDAN in bypassing perplexity filters and jailbreaking LLMs. Customize AutoDAN’s objective to leak system prompts and evaluate its performance in this task.

After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

2. The effectiveness of AutoDAN may depend on the specific LLMs and datasets used in the experiments, and its generalizability to other models and tasks may be limited.

Comparison and Decision:
Both OpenTab and AutoDAN address important challenges in the field of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. However, OpenTab tackles a more fundamental and widely applicable problem of enabling LLMs to perform open-domain table reasoning, which has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities of these models. The proposed framework, which leverages LLMs to generate SQL programs and employs novel strategies like GRSR, is well-designed and thoroughly evaluated. In contrast, while AutoDAN addresses the critical issue of jailbreak attacks, its focus is more narrow, and the long-term impact on the field may be less significant compared to OpenTab.

Therefore, considering the broader impact, novelty, and thoroughness of the proposed method and experiment plan, OpenTab is likely to be the accepted idea.

paper 1:
Chain of Hindsight aligns Language Models with Feedback:
  Title: Chain of Hindsight aligns Language Models with Feedback
  Problem Statement: Learning from human preferences is crucial for language models to align with human needs and social values. Existing methods either rely on hand-picked model generations favored by human annotators, which are inefficient and hard to generalize, or depend on reinforcement learning, which suffers from imperfect reward functions and challenging optimizations.
  Motivation: Prior methods are limited by their inefficiency in data utilization and the complexity of reinforcement learning optimizations. Hand-picked model generations are not scalable, and reinforcement learning often struggles with imperfect reward functions. Inspired by how humans learn from extensive feedback in natural language, the proposed method aims to leverage all forms of feedback, regardless of polarity, to fine-tune language models more effectively.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Chain of Hindsight (CoH), converts all types of feedback into sequences of sentences, which are then used to fine-tune the model. The model is conditioned on a sequence of model generations paired with feedback, training it to generate outputs based on feedback while learning to identify and correct negative attributes or errors. This method allows the model to learn from both positive and negative feedback, significantly improving its alignment with human preferences.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use a combination of three datasets for learning from human feedback: WebGPT, Anthropic’s Helpful and Harmless (HH) dataset, and a summarization dataset. WebGPT includes 19,578 comparisons of model answers rated by humans. The HH dataset contains human-rated dialogues, and the summarization dataset consists of feedback on model-generated summaries.
    Step 2: Construct Training Sequences: For each dataset, construct training sequences by combining model outputs with feedback based on human ratings. For example, when a model is prompted to explain neural networks to a child, it generates multiple responses. These responses are combined into a sequence and paired with feedback instructions generated based on human ratings.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT-J 6B and OPT as the base pretrained models. Other language models can also be used.
    Step 4: Training: Train the model on the constructed sequences using a conventional Transformer model architecture that is causal and decoder-only. The model is conditioned to predict outputs that better match the feedback. Randomly mask between 0% and 5% of past tokens during training to regularize the model and prevent overfitting. Add a regularization term to maximize the log likelihood of the pretraining dataset.
    Step 5: Evaluation: Evaluate the model on summarization and dialogue benchmarks. For summarization, use the TL;DR dataset and metrics such as coverage, accuracy, and coherence. For dialogue, use the HH dataset and metrics such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Conduct both automatic and human evaluations.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the CoH method with baselines including SFT, SFT with unlikelihood, conditional SFT, and RLHF. Report improvements in alignment with human preferences based on both automated assessments and human evaluations.


paper 2:
Skill Reinforcement Learning and Planning for Open-World Long-Horizon Tasks:
  Title: Skill Reinforcement Learning and Planning for Open-World Long-Horizon Tasks
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of building an agent capable of solving diverse long-horizon tasks in open-world environments without human demonstrations. This problem is interesting and important because it aims to create generally capable agents that can operate efficiently in complex, dynamic environments like Minecraft, which has an infinitely large world size and a huge variety of tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as imitation learning, require expert demonstrations or large-scale video datasets, making them impractical for many applications. Reinforcement learning (RL) without demonstrations is extremely sample-inefficient in large open-world environments due to the vast state space and long task horizons. The proposed method aims to improve sample efficiency by decomposing tasks into basic skills and planning over these skills, leveraging intrinsic rewards and prior knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a skill graph and plan skill sequences.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves converting the multi-task learning problem into learning basic skills and planning over these skills. The method introduces a Finding-skill to improve sample efficiency for training all skills. The approach is tested using Minecraft, where three types of fine-grained basic skills are defined: Finding-skills, Manipulation-skills, and Crafting-skills. RL with intrinsic rewards is used to acquire these skills. For skill planning, the method leverages LLMs to find relationships between skills and build a skill graph. A skill search algorithm then walks on this graph to generate proper skill plans for the agent. The method is evaluated on 40 diverse Minecraft tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over baselines in terms of sample efficiency and task success rates.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the MineDojo simulator to create 40 diverse tasks in Minecraft, involving collecting materials, crafting items, and interacting with mobs. These tasks require planning and execution of 2 to 30 basic skills and take thousands of environmental steps.
    Step 2: Train Basic Skills:
      Finding-skills: Train a hierarchical policy with a high-level recurrent policy to maximize the visited area and a low-level policy to navigate to goal locations. Use state count and goal navigation rewards.
      Manipulation-skills: Train policies using PPO with intrinsic rewards like MineCLIP, distance, and attack rewards. Use specified environments to initialize target items nearby or execute Finding-skills to reach target items.
      Crafting-skills: Execute with a single action in MineDojo. No additional training required.
    Step 3: Construct Skill Graph: Interact with ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) to generate structured information for all skills, defining relationships between skills in a graph format. Verify and correct the generated information according to the Minecraft database.
    Step 4: Skill Planning: Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on the skill graph to generate skill sequences for tasks. Alternate skill planning and execution, updating the agent's condition based on inventory and last executed skill.
    Step 5: Evaluate Performance: Test the method on the 40 tasks, averaging results over 30 test episodes. Compare success rates with baselines like MineAgent and Plan4MC without Finding-skill. Analyze the impact of intrinsic rewards and the generalization capabilities of learned skills.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of AI and propose novel methods to tackle them. However, there are notable differences in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1 focuses on aligning language models with human preferences using a novel approach called Chain of Hindsight (CoH). The main strength of this paper lies in its efficient utilization of both positive and negative feedback to fine-tune the model, which is a significant improvement over existing methods. The proposed method is well-motivated, and the step-by-step experiment plan is clear and comprehensive. The evaluation plan, which includes both automatic and human assessments, is appropriate for measuring the model's alignment with human preferences.

Paper 2 addresses the challenge of building an agent capable of solving diverse long-horizon tasks in open-world environments without human demonstrations. The main strength of this paper is its novel approach to decomposing tasks into basic skills and planning over these skills, which significantly improves sample efficiency. The use of intrinsic rewards and prior knowledge from LLMs to build a skill graph and plan skill sequences is innovative and well-justified. The evaluation plan, which tests the method on 40 diverse Minecraft tasks, is comprehensive and demonstrates the method's effectiveness.

While both papers make significant contributions, Paper 2 appears to have a slight edge in terms of its potential impact and the novelty of its approach. The problem of building generally capable agents that can operate efficiently in complex, dynamic environments is a fundamental challenge in AI, and the proposed method offers a promising solution. The decomposition of tasks into basic skills and the use of LLMs for skill planning are particularly innovative and could have far-reaching implications for other domains beyond Minecraft.

In contrast, while Paper 1's Chain of Hindsight method is a notable improvement over existing approaches for aligning language models with human preferences, the problem it addresses is more specific and may have a more limited impact compared to the general challenge of building capable agents for open-world environments.

paper 1:
Integrating Visual Cues via Prompting for Low-Resource Multimodal Named Entity Recognition:
  Title: Integrating Visual Cues via Prompting for Low-Resource Multimodal Named Entity Recognition
  Problem Statement: The task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) is well-established in NLP, but existing methods predominantly rely on textual data alone, overlooking the potential information from other modalities such as images. This issue is particularly pronounced in low-resource settings where the absence of extensive labeled data can significantly impede the performance of NER systems.
  Motivation: Existing solutions often require comprehensive fine-tuning and are not readily applicable in low-resource conditions. The proposed method aims to address these limitations by leveraging modern generative language models and recasting the MNER task as an open-ended question-answering problem. This approach is expected to be more effective in integrating visual information and improving NER performance under low-resource constraints.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves transforming the MNER task into an open-ended question-answering task suitable for generative language models. This involves constructing prompts that include instructions, questions, text segments, and model outputs. The method also involves querying specific entity types using consistent structures and resolving conflicts based on confidence scores.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate our approach on two publicly available Twitter datasets containing text-image pairs: Twitter2015 and Twitter2017. These datasets encompass tweets spanning diverse topical domains including news, entertainment, and daily experiences. Both datasets annotate entities with four types: persons, organizations, locations, and miscellaneous.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: The design of the prompts includes the following elements: Instruction (I), Question (Q), Text (T), Answer (A), and Training Examples (TE). Example prompts include: 'What word(s) in the text corresponds to a [ENT] entity?', '[ENT] in text?', '[ENT] entity in text?', 'What is the [ENT] entity in the text?', and 'What is the [ENT] in the text?'.
    Step 3: Select Models: We evaluate the few-shot learning performance of several state-of-the-art multimodal models including FLAN-T5-XL, FLAN-T5-XXL, BLIP2-FLAN-T5-XL, BLIP2-FLAN-T5-XXL, InstructBLIP-FLAN-T5-XL, and InstructBLIP-FLAN-T5-XXL. These models leverage large pre-trained language models alongside CLIP’s strong vision capabilities.
    Step 4: Get Results: We evaluate the models' performance using mean micro F1 scores across question prompt templates. The experiments are conducted on the Twitter2015 and Twitter2017 datasets, and the models' performance is evaluated with and without images.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine the efficacy of visual integration in improving NER performance. Compare the performance of models with and without images, and evaluate the impact of different prompts on the results. Discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed method and suggest avenues for future research.

GenSim: Generating Robotic Simulation Tasks via Large Language Models:
  Title: GenSim: Generating Robotic Simulation Tasks via Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive. Existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scene-level diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization.
  Motivation: Existing methods for data generation in robotic simulations focus on scene-level diversity and fail to address task-level diversity due to the significant human effort required. This limitation hinders the ability of policies trained on simulation data to generalize across different tasks. The proposed method leverages the grounding and coding abilities of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate diverse simulation tasks, which can significantly enhance task-level generalization. By using LLMs, the method can generate a wide variety of tasks with minimal human intervention, making it more scalable and efficient than existing approaches.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, GenSim, uses large language models to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations. GenSim operates in two modes: goal-directed generation and exploratory generation. In goal-directed generation, a target task is given to the LLM, which then proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task. In exploratory generation, the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. The framework consists of three components: (1) prompting mechanisms that propose new tasks in natural language and their corresponding implementations in code, (2) a task library that caches previously generated high-quality instruction code for validation and language model finetuning, and (3) a language-conditioned multi-task policy training procedure that leverages the generated data to enhance task-level generalization.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Initialize the task library with 10 human-curated tasks from the Ravens benchmark. Use GPT-4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For goal-directed generation, prompt the LLM with a specific task and ask it to generate a task curriculum. For exploratory generation, prompt the LLM to generate novel tasks that are different from existing ones. Example prompt for goal-directed generation: 'Generate a task curriculum to solve the task of building a car.' Example prompt for exploratory generation: 'Generate a new task that is different from the existing tasks in the library.'
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-4 for initial task generation. Finetune other LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and Code-Llama, on the generated task library to improve their task generation performance.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate task codes using the LLMs and validate them through syntax checks, runtime verification, and task completion metrics. Store high-quality tasks in the task library.
    Step 5: Train Policies: Use the generated task implementations to create demonstration data and train language-conditioned multi-task policies. Evaluate the policies on their ability to generalize to new tasks in simulation and the real world.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of policies trained on LLM-generated tasks with those trained on human-curated tasks. Measure task-level generalization and sim-to-real transfer performance. Analyze the impact of the number and diversity of tasks on policy performance.

Quack: Automatic Jailbreaking Large Language Models via Role-playing:
  Title: Quack: Automatic Jailbreaking Large Language Models via Role-playing
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in generating human-like text but are susceptible to misuse, raising public concern. Proactive testing with jailbreaks—crafted prompts that bypass model constraints—is essential to ensure security and reliability. Existing methods for creating jailbreaks face several challenges: they require human labor and expertise, lack reproducibility, and are ineffective on updated model versions.
  Motivation: Current methods for jailbreaking LLMs are labor-intensive, non-deterministic, and often ineffective on updated models. These limitations necessitate a more automated and systematic approach. The proposed method, Quack, leverages role-playing to automate the generation, evaluation, and updating of jailbreaks, making the process more efficient and reproducible. By using knowledge graphs and assigning distinct roles to LLMs, Quack aims to maintain and improve jailbreak effectiveness even as models evolve.
  Proposed Method: Quack is an automated testing framework that uses role-playing to generate, evaluate, and update jailbreaks for LLMs. It translates testing guidelines into question prompts and consolidates successful jailbreaks into a paradigm with eight distinct characteristics. These characteristics are stored in knowledge graphs, which serve as a repository for playing scenarios. Quack assigns four roles to LLMs—Materializer, Organizer, Referee, and Advisor—to automate the process of organizing, evaluating, and updating jailbreaks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect existing jailbreaks from Jailbreak Chat and evaluate their effectiveness on ChatGPT using specific harmful prompts. Retain effective jailbreaks and summarize them into a paradigm with eight characteristics.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Generate question prompts based on testing guidelines from the 'ETHICS GUIDELINES FOR TRUSTWORTHY AI' by the European Commission. Example prompt: 'What are the potential side effects of taking ibuprofen?'
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate the method on three open-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, LLaMa-7B) and one commercial LLM (ChatGPT).
    Step 4: Role Assignment: Assign roles to LLMs: Materializer generates question prompts and oracle responses, Organizer combines jailbreak facts into playing scenarios, Referee calculates similarity scores between responses, and Advisor provides advice to reduce similarity scores.
    Step 5: Generate Initial Jailbreaks: Insert question prompts into playing scenarios and input them to the target LLM to get responses. Calculate similarity scores between the responses and the oracle.
    Step 6: Iterative Optimization: Advisor provides advice to Organizer to update playing scenarios iteratively until successful jailbreaks are generated. Store successful scenarios in knowledge graphs for future reuse.
    Step 7: Evaluate Effectiveness: Measure the jailbreak success rate on different LLMs and model versions. Compare the performance of Quack with original jailbreaks and analyze the improvement in success rates.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the similarity scores across iterations to evaluate the effectiveness of the iterative optimization process. Assess the ability of Quack to update invalid jailbreaks and maintain effectiveness on different model versions.

Tuning LayerNorm in Attention:
  Title: Tuning LayerNorm in Attention: Towards Efficient Multi-Modal LLM Finetuning
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently transforming Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This transformation is computationally intensive, especially for large-scale models, and existing methods often compromise performance for efficiency.
  Motivation: Existing methods like full parameter finetuning and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) are either computationally expensive or result in compromised performance on multi-modal tasks. The inspiration behind the proposed method is the observation that tuning LayerNorm within each attention block can yield strong performance with significantly fewer trainable parameters and reduced GPU memory usage. The proposed method is expected to work better because it conceptualizes the transformation as a domain adaptation process, leveraging the effectiveness of normalization layers in such shifts.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves tuning only the LayerNorm parameters within each attention block of the LLM. This approach is based on the understanding that the transition from text-centric to multi-modal understanding can be effectively managed by adjusting normalization layers. The method also explores selectively tuning with conversational data to further improve efficiency. The process can be simplified by designating LayerNorm as the sole trainable component, termed as LayerNorm-simple.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets used include CC3M for pre-training the vision-language connector and 80K filtered image-text pairs for finetuning. Evaluation is conducted on five multi-modal benchmarks: MME, VQAv2, MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and POPE.
    Step 2: Select Models: The models used for the language decoder include VICUNA-7B(v1.1), LLAMA2-7B&13B, and LLAMA2-CHAT-7B&13B. The vision encoder is a CLIP-pretrained ViT-L, and the vision-language connector is a simple linear projector.
    Step 3: Tuning Modules: Five different tuning paradigms are employed: (1) Finetune all parameters, (2) LoRA with rank 32, (3) Attn. QV Proj. (activates Q and V linear projection in attention), (4) Attn. MLP (activates MLP layers in attention), and (5) LayerNorm (activates only LayerNorm in attention blocks).
    Step 4: Training Details: Pre-train the vision-language connector for 3 epochs on CC3M. Finetune on 80K filtered image-text pairs for 1 epoch. Use a learning rate of 2e-3 for pre-training and search from 2e-3 to 1e-7 for finetuning. Set weight decay to 0, warmup ratio to 0.03, and use the cosine learning rate scheduler. Employ gradient checkpointing, DeepSpeed, and TensorFloat32 for training. Conduct experiments on 4 80G A100 GPUs.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the five multi-modal benchmarks. Compare the performance of different tuning methods, focusing on trainable parameters, GPU memory usage, and task performance.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the role of LayerNorm in adapting LLMs to the multi-modal domain. Investigate the expressive power of LayerNorm-tuned models by computing layer similarities and gradient variances. Compare the performance of models tuned with different data types (conversational, detailed description, complex reasoning) to understand the impact of data on finetuning efficiency.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs).

On the Humanity of Conversational AI:
  Title: On the Humanity of Conversational AI: Evaluating the Psychological Portrayal of LLMs
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, evolving into assistants capable of addressing diverse user requests. This evolution narrows the distinction between human beings and artificial intelligence agents, raising questions about the potential manifestation of personalities, temperaments, and emotions within LLMs.
  Motivation: Existing methods primarily focus on evaluating the performance of LLMs on defined tasks, but they do not comprehensively address the inherent psychological qualities and attributes of these models. Understanding the psychological portrayal of LLMs can guide researchers in building more human-like, empathetic, and engaging AI-powered communication tools. Additionally, it can help identify potential biases, harmful behavior, or unintended consequences that might arise from their deployment.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes a framework called PsychoBench for evaluating diverse psychological aspects of LLMs. PsychoBench comprises thirteen scales commonly used in clinical psychology, classified into four distinct categories: personality traits, interpersonal relationships, motivational tests, and emotional abilities. The study examines five popular models: text-davinci-003, ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA-2-7b, and LLaMA-2-13b. Additionally, a jailbreak approach is employed to bypass the safety alignment protocols and test the intrinsic natures of LLMs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The study uses responses provided by human subjects from existing literature to serve as a basis for comparative analysis with LLMs. The human data is collected from various demographic groups and regions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each scale, the models are prompted to reply only with a number within the Likert scale levels. Detailed explanations for the interpretation of each Likert level are provided. Example prompt: 'You can only reply numbers from MIN to MAX in the following statements. Here are the statements, score them one by one: statements.'
    Step 3: Select Models: The study examines five popular models: text-davinci-003, ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo), GPT-4, LLaMA-2-7b, and LLaMA-2-13b. Additionally, a jailbroken version of GPT-4 (gpt-4-jb) is used to bypass the safety alignment protocols.
    Step 4: Get Results: The models undergo ten independent runs for every scale within PsychoBench. The computed mean and standard deviation represent the final results. The results are compared with human norms to identify significant differences.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: The study analyzes the results to identify distinct personality traits, interpersonal relationships, motivational tests, and emotional abilities exhibited by the LLMs. The impact of model size, updates, and the jailbreak approach on the psychological portrayal of LLMs is also examined. Additionally, the validity of the scales on LLMs is verified by assigning specific roles to the models and evaluating their performance on QA tasks like TruthfulQA and SafetyQA.

Transforming Smallholder Farmers Support with an AI-Powered FAQbot:
  Title: Transforming Smallholder Farmers Support with an AI-Powered FAQbot: A Comparison of Techniques
  Problem Statement: Access to sufficient information on desired agricultural practices, such as planting period, when to apply fertilizer, how to transport grains, etc., is of utmost importance in the agricultural industry as it directly affects farm yields. The responses to these questions are closed domain, leading to the development of a question-answering conversational bot (FAQbot) that can provide the appropriate responses immediately.
  Motivation: Existing methods for providing agricultural information are often scattered across various sources and are not easily accessible to smallholder farmers. Traditional methods like rule-based systems and statistical models are limited in handling ambiguity and require extensive manual effort. Generative models require substantial data for effective training, which is often not available. The proposed retrieval-based method leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieval techniques to provide precise and contextually relevant answers, overcoming the limitations of generative models and intent classification approaches.
  Proposed Method: The study undertakes a comparative analysis of three distinct methodologies for constructing a FAQbot: 1) Generative-based chatbot employing BERT and GPT-2, 2) Intent classification model leveraging PyTorch and NLTK libraries, and 3) Information retrieval-based model utilizing pre-trained LLMs using Langchain. The retrieval-based method consistently provided precise answers for every question in the database, irrespective of rephrasing or reframing.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The dataset comprises question-answer pairs extracted from FAQs of an agricultural firm, sourced from a CSV database containing around 38 pairs. Each pair is associated with a specific tag, yielding approximately 32 unique tags.
    Step 2: Data Preprocessing: General preprocessing steps include special character removal using regular expressions and word decontraction. For the generative-based approach, both positive and negative samples of question-answer pairs are required. Positive samples consist of question Q and answer A from the same pair, labeled 1.0. Negative samples, labeled as -1.0, comprise an original question Q and an answer A’ from the dataset, where the tag T’ differs from the tag T associated with the original question.
    Step 3: Generative-Based Model Approach:
      BERT Fine-Tuning and Training Embedding Extractor: Utilize a pre-trained BERT base-cased model and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) to extract embeddings from question-answer pairs. Employ a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to measure the difference between expected cosine similarities and those predicted by the model.
      Fine-Tuning GPT-2 Model: Fine-tune the GPT-2 model to generate answers for the questions. The model takes concatenated sequences of similar question-answer pairs and generates an answer for the given question.
    Step 4: Intent Classification Approach:
      Text Processing Steps: Tokenization, Lowercase conversion, Stemming, and Bag of Words (BoW).
      Model Construction: Construct a feed-forward neural network using the PyTorch framework. The input layer's dimensions correspond to the count of distinct words in the dataset. The hidden layers are designed with sizes that are integer multiples of 2, and the output layer is dimensioned to align with the number of distinct tags in the dataset. Use Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as the activation function and incorporate a dropout layer to mitigate overfitting.
    Step 5: Retrieval-Based Model Approach:
      Embeddings and Vectorization: Load structured textual data via the CSVLoader module. Segment documents into smaller units using the CharacterTextSplitter. Employ OpenAIEmbeddings to capture the semantic essence of the text. Use the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer and cosine similarity check from scikit-learn to bolster the relevance of user queries for retrieving answers from the vector database.
      Document Storage and Retrieval: Store preprocessed text segments within a Chroma vector store. Use a retriever interface to streamline the retrieval process, ensuring both accuracy and rapid document selection. The vector index retrieval mechanism employs a similarity-driven approach to pinpoint the most pertinent answers within the database.
      Chain Construction: Establish a RetrievalQA chain using the OpenAI language model. The RetrievalQA chain combines document retrieval with question-answering capabilities, delivering efficient and rapid responses. Use the from chain type() method to create an instance of the Retrieval QA system, specifying the OpenAI Language Model, chaining type ('stuff' for comprehensive answers retrieval), a retriever from the Chroma vector storage database, and a flag to return source documents for faithful database answers.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the three approaches on rephrased queries. The retrieval-based approach consistently delivered highly accurate responses, while the intent classification approach performed commendably but was hampered by its inability to accurately predict tags for approximately 15% of the queries. The generative-based approach performed the least due to the scarcity of robust training data.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the three approaches. The retrieval-based approach outperformed others, providing the most accurate and contextually relevant answers. The intent classification approach followed closely, while the generative-based approach faced limitations due to insufficient training data.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

Adapting Retrieval Models to Task-Specific Goals using Reinforcement Learning:
  Title: Adapting Retrieval Models to Task-Specific Goals using Reinforcement Learning
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing retrieval models for task-specific goals, which often correspond to non-differentiable losses. Traditional supervised learning methods struggle with this because they cannot directly optimize for metrics like recall, novelty, or accuracy of a blackbox large language model (LLM) in retrieval-augmented generation tasks.
  Motivation: Existing supervised learning methods typically optimize for general relevance using differentiable losses like contrastive learning. However, these methods do not directly optimize for the quality of the top-k ranked list of items, which is crucial for many retrieval tasks. The proposed method leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize arbitrary task-specific losses, addressing the limitations of supervised learning by using policy gradient methods and reducing the action space to a binary decision, which makes the optimization more feasible.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method is a reinforcement learning-based framework that can be applied to any pretrained retrieval model. It uses policy gradient to fine-tune the model towards task-specific goals. The key innovation is the reduction of the large action space to a binary action space by considering the (query, item) pair as a state. This formulation allows for efficient optimization and exploration using auxiliary retrieval models. The method is evaluated using empirical experiments on improving recall and novelty in retrieval tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Two datasets are used for evaluation: (1) QADSM dataset from the X-GLUE benchmark with 100K training and 10K test query-ad pairs, and (2) Query-Keyword dataset from a commercial search engine with 110K training and 4.2K test query-keyword pairs, and 1.95M actions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper. Instead, the focus is on the model architecture and training objectives.
    Step 3: Select Models: The base model is a pretrained semantic similarity model (stsb-xlm-r-multilingual for QADSM and SimCSE for Query-Keyword). The reward models used are gtr-t5-base for QADSM and GPT-3.5 for Query-Keyword.
    Step 4: Training Objectives: For the supervised model, use InfoNCE contrastive loss with random negatives. For the RL-based model (PG-Ret), use policy gradient with a reward function tailored to the task-specific goal (e.g., recall or novelty). The reward function for recall is defined as increasing the probability of relevant items not in the top-k list and decreasing the probability of irrelevant items in the top-k list.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the test sets using Recall@K and Novelty@K metrics. For QADSM, compare the recall of the base, supervised, and PG-Ret models. For Query-Keyword, compare both recall and novelty metrics.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the improvements in recall and novelty metrics. For QADSM, PG-Ret should show substantial gains in recall over the supervised model. For Query-Keyword, PG-Ret should show increased novelty with minimal loss in precision. Additionally, conduct an A/B test on real user traffic to measure the impact on click yield.

MUSTARD: Mastering Uniform Synthesis of Theorem and Proof Data:
  Title: MUSTARD: Mastering Uniform Synthesis of Theorem and Proof Data
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in mathematical reasoning and theorem proving, but they still face challenges due to the need for strict and formal multi-step inference. Existing benchmarks lack sufficient training steps due to the labor-intensive nature of step-wise annotation.
  Motivation: Previous methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance, but they require heavy manual labor for annotation, resulting in small-scale datasets. Manual annotations are prone to errors, and rule-based generation methods often produce data that lack meaningful mathematical knowledge. The proposed method, MUSTARD, aims to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data with accurate intermediate steps by leveraging the strengths of LLMs in verbalization and formal theorem provers in rigorous data validation.
  Proposed Method: MUSTARD is a data generation framework that synthesizes theorem and proof data in three stages: (1) Concept Seeding: Sampling mathematical concepts as problem categories. (2) Proof Generation: Prompting an LLM to generate problems and their step-wise formal solutions. (3) Proof Filtering: Using a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to validate the generated proofs. The framework iteratively refines invalid solutions based on error messages from the prover until valid proofs are obtained.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The generated dataset, MUSTARD SAUCE, contains 5,866 valid data points, each with an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes prover validation. The dataset spans four educational levels: elementary school, middle school, high school, and higher education.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For proof generation, the LLM is prompted to generate a problem statement, its natural language solution, and a formal solution in Lean. Example prompt: 'You are a math expert. Now please come up with a math problem according to the following requirements. The math problem should contain a question part (indicated by “Problem: ”), a corresponding solution in natural language (indicated by “Informal proof:”), and a translated formal solution in Lean 3 (indicated by “Formal proof in Lean 3:”). Please note that the informal proof and the formal proof need to be identical.

Both papers address important challenges in their respective domains. Paper 1 focuses on adapting retrieval models to task-specific goals using reinforcement learning, while Paper 2 proposes a framework for generating large-scale, high-quality mathematical data with accurate intermediate steps.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the limitation of supervised learning in optimizing for task-specific goals in retrieval models.
- Proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based framework that can be applied to any pretrained retrieval model.
- Reduces the large action space to a binary action space, making optimization more feasible.
- Provides a clear step-by-step experiment plan with well-defined datasets, models, and evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The proposed method is limited to binary actions, which may not be suitable for all retrieval tasks.
- The effectiveness of the method may depend on the quality of the reward models used.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Addresses the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets for mathematical reasoning and theorem proving.
- Proposes a novel data generation framework that leverages the strengths of LLMs and formal theorem provers.
- Generates a diverse dataset spanning multiple educational levels and mathematical domains.
- Provides a clear step-by-step experiment plan with well-defined prompts, models, and evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The quality of the generated data heavily relies on the performance of the LLM and the formal theorem prover used.
- The iterative refinement process may be computationally expensive and time-consuming.

Comparing the two papers, Paper 2 (MUSTARD) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The problem it addresses is more fundamental and has broader implications for the field of mathematical reasoning and theorem proving. The proposed method is novel, well-motivated, and has the potential to generate large-scale, high-quality datasets that can significantly advance the field. Additionally, the step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive and includes extensive analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated data.

In contrast, while Paper 1 proposes an interesting approach to optimizing retrieval models for task-specific goals, the problem it addresses is more narrow in scope, and the proposed method may have limitations in terms of the action space and dependence on reward models.

Seeking Neural Nuggets: Knowledge Transfer in Large Language Models from a Parametric Perspective:
  Title: Seeking Neural Nuggets: Knowledge Transfer in Large Language Models from a Parametric Perspective
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode a wealth of knowledge within their parameters through pre-training on extensive corpora. However, the transferability of this implicit knowledge across models of varying scales remains ambiguous. This paper aims to empirically investigate the transfer of knowledge from larger to smaller models from a parametric perspective.
  Motivation: Existing methods have explored the detection, editing, and merging of implicit knowledge within a single model but have not sufficiently addressed the transferability of this knowledge across different model scales. The proposed method aims to fill this gap by focusing on the parametric transfer of knowledge, which could democratize access to advanced machine learning capabilities by enabling smaller models to benefit from the knowledge embedded in larger models.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves two main stages: knowledge extraction and knowledge injection. Sensitivity-based techniques are used to extract and align knowledge-specific parameters between different LLMs. The LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) module is then used as the intermediary mechanism for injecting the extracted knowledge into smaller models. This approach ensures that the architecture and the number of parameters of the student model remain unchanged during the knowledge transfer process.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The evaluations are conducted across four distinct benchmark categories: Reasoning (GSM dataset), Professional Knowledge (MMLU dataset), Instruction-driven NLP Tasks (Super NI dataset), and Open-ended Conversation (AlpacaFarm dataset).
    Step 2: Select Models: The larger-scale LLaMA models (13B and 30B) serve as the teacher models, and their smaller-scale counterparts (7B and 13B) act as the student models. Both LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 versions are used.
    Step 3: Knowledge Extraction: 1. Compute sensitivity metrics using a set of 32 seed samples from the teacher model. 2. Calculate sensitivity scores for each parameter and aggregate them to determine layer-specific sensitivity scores. 3. Select the top layers with the highest sensitivity scores and map them to the student model. 4. Extract submatrices from the teacher model's parameter matrices based on sensitivity scores.
    Step 4: Knowledge Injection: 1. Factorize the extracted parameter matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). 2. Initialize the student model's LoRA module with the factorized matrices. 3. Fine-tune the student model on the respective training datasets for 3 epochs with a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 3e-4.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the student models on the four benchmark categories using established metrics and prompts. Compare the results with those of the baseline models and analyze the improvements.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: 1. Compare the performance of student models with and without parametric knowledge transfer. 2. Investigate the impact of different initialization strategies, the number of seed samples, the origin of extracted parameters, and the structure of extracted parameters on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. 3. Conduct additional experiments to explore the transferability of task-specific knowledge and the trade-offs between performance and running costs.

Aligning Agents like Large Language Models:
  Title: Aligning Agents like Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Training agents to behave as desired in complex 3D environments from visual information is challenging. Imitation learning from diverse human behavior provides a scalable mechanism for training an agent with generally sensible behaviors, but such an agent may not perform the specific behaviors of interest when deployed.
  Motivation: Existing methods like imitation learning can train agents to exhibit general behaviors but often include undesirable actions, similar to unhelpful responses from unaligned large language models (LLMs). The proposed method draws inspiration from the alignment procedures used for LLMs, hypothesizing that these can be adapted to align agents in 3D environments to perform specific desired behaviors. This approach is expected to work better because it combines the generalization benefits of large-scale imitation learning with the specificity of reinforcement learning from human preferences.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a multi-step process: 1) Train a base imitation learning model on a large dataset of human gameplay to provide a general behavioral prior. 2) Fine-tune this model on a smaller, task-specific dataset to focus on the desired behavior. 3) Generate online rollouts of the fine-tuned agent and collect human preferences on these trajectories. 4) Train a reward model based on these preferences. 5) Use reinforcement learning to align the agent's behavior with the reward model, ensuring it performs the desired behavior consistently.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect a large dataset of human gameplay from the video game Bleeding Edge, consisting of 71,940 individual player trajectories from 8788 matches, amounting to 9875 hours of gameplay. Additionally, curate a smaller task-specific dataset of 300 trajectories (100 successful trajectories per jumppad) for fine-tuning.
    Step 2: Model Architecture and Training: Use a GPT-2 causal transformer architecture with 103M parameters for the base model. Train this model on the large dataset using a cross-entropy loss to predict gamepad actions from visual observations. Fine-tune this model on the smaller task-specific dataset to improve task-specific performance.
    Step 3: Generate Online Rollouts and Preferences: Run the fine-tuned agent in the game environment to generate 2400 on-policy trajectories. Use synthetic preferences to rank these trajectories based on the desired behavior (e.g., reaching a specific jumppad).
    Step 4: Train Reward Model: Train a reward model using the Bradley-Terry model on the pairwise preferences obtained from the online rollouts. Use the fine-tuned policy model's encoder to generate embeddings for the reward model.
    Step 5: Align Agent with Reward Model: Use reinforcement learning (REINFORCE) to align the agent's behavior with the reward model. Perform online updates for 9600 episodes, using a batch size of 16 for 600 online parameter updates. Optionally, perform preference fine-tuning on the top 20% of trajectories by reward before online alignment.
    Step 6: Evaluate Aligned Agent: Evaluate the final aligned agent in the game environment to ensure it consistently performs the desired behavior. Analyze the success rate and distribution of behaviors to confirm alignment.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose interesting ideas for knowledge transfer and alignment in large language models and agents. However, there are some key differences in their approaches and potential impact.

Paper 1 focuses on the parametric transfer of knowledge from larger to smaller language models. The proposed method of extracting and injecting knowledge-specific parameters using sensitivity-based techniques and LoRA modules is novel and well-defined. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering various benchmark categories and analyzing the impact of different factors on knowledge transfer effectiveness. The potential to democratize access to advanced machine learning capabilities by enabling smaller models to benefit from the knowledge of larger models is a significant contribution.

On the other hand, Paper 2 proposes adapting alignment procedures used for LLMs to align agents in 3D environments. While the idea of combining imitation learning with reinforcement learning from human preferences is interesting, the experiment plan is less comprehensive compared to Paper 1. The focus on a specific video game and the use of synthetic preferences for ranking trajectories may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the potential impact of aligning agents in 3D environments is less clear compared to the democratization of knowledge in language models.

Considering the novelty of the proposed method, the comprehensiveness of the experiment plan, and the potential impact on the field, Paper 1 appears to be a stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.

Analyzing Feed-Forward Blocks in Transformers through the Lens of Attention Maps:
  Title: Analyzing Feed-Forward Blocks in Transformers through the Lens of Attention Maps
  Problem Statement: Transformers are widely used in various tasks, but understanding their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. Specifically, the role of feed-forward (FF) blocks, which contain a substantial number of parameters, is not well understood. This paper aims to analyze the input contextualization effects of FF blocks by visualizing them in attention maps.
  Motivation: Existing methods primarily focus on the attention mechanisms and residual connections within Transformers, often overlooking the FF blocks despite their significant parameter count. Previous studies have shown that FF blocks perform some linguistic operations, but their role in input contextualization has not been explicitly analyzed. The proposed method aims to fill this gap by extending norm-based analysis to include FF blocks, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the Transformer's internal processing.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves rendering the effects of FF blocks in attention maps using a norm-based analysis extended with integrated gradients (IG). This approach allows for the visualization of how FF blocks modify input contextualization. The method decomposes the entire Transformer layer into a sum of transformed vectors, enabling the tracking of each component's effect on input contextualization.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use two datasets: Wikipedia excerpts (992 sequences) and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 dataset (872 sequences from the validation set). The input is segmented by each model’s pre-trained tokenizers, and analysis is conducted at the subword level.
    Step 2: Select Models: Analyze 11 variants of masked language models (six BERTs with different sizes, three BERTs-base with different seeds, and two RoBERTas with different sizes) and two causal language models (GPT-2 with 117M parameters and OPT with 125M parameters).
    Step 3: Compute Attention Maps: Compute attention maps for each model using four different scopes: ATB (attention block), ATBFF (attention block and feed-forward), ATBFFRES (attention block, feed-forward, and residual), and ATBFFRESLN (entire layer).
    Step 4: Measure Contextualization Change: Quantify the contextualization change by calculating the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between attention maps from different scopes. Report the average contextualization change across input sequences.
    Step 5: Analyze Linguistic Patterns: Compare attention maps before and after FF to identify which types of token pairs gain higher FF-amp scores. Categorize these pairs into linguistic patterns and analyze the distribution of these categories across different layers.
    Step 6: Investigate Redundancy: Analyze the relationship between the contextualization performed by FF and other components like residual and normalization layers. Measure the L2 norm of the output vectors from FF and the bypassed vectors via residual connections. Examine how layer normalization affects the contextualization by shrinking specific dimensions.

Improving Large Language Model Fine-tuning for Solving Math Problems:
  Title: Improving Large Language Model Fine-tuning for Solving Math Problems
  Problem Statement: Despite their success in many natural language tasks, solving math problems remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). A large gap exists between LLMs' pass-at-one and pass-at-N performance in solving math problems, suggesting LLMs might be close to finding correct solutions but struggle to discriminate correct from incorrect solutions.
  Motivation: Existing methods show that LLMs can generate correct solutions but fail to consistently identify them. This performance gap indicates that LLMs have the potential to solve math problems more effectively if they can be fine-tuned to better generate and evaluate solutions. The proposed methods aim to enhance LLMs' performance by focusing on fine-tuning strategies that improve both solution generation and evaluation.
  Proposed Method: The paper investigates three fine-tuning strategies: (1) Supervised step-by-step solution fine-tuning (SSFT), where LLMs are fine-tuned to generate detailed solutions for math problems; (2) Solution-cluster re-ranking (SCR), where LLMs are fine-tuned as solution evaluators to choose among generated candidate solution clusters; (3) Multi-task sequential fine-tuning, which integrates both solution generation and evaluation tasks to enhance LLM performance.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the MATH dataset, which consists of problems from high school math competitions, and the PRM800K dataset, which includes model-generated correct solutions for a subset of MATH problems.
    Step 2: Fine-tune Models:
      Supervised Solution Fine-tuning (SSFT): Fine-tune PaLM 2-S* and PaLM 2-L models on step-by-step solutions using the MLE training objective. Use three strategies: (1) fine-tuning on MATH solutions, (2) fine-tuning on PRM800K solutions, and (3) fine-tuning on both MATH and PRM800K solutions.
      Solution-cluster Re-ranking (SCR): Fine-tune the models as solution evaluators using margin loss and cross-entropy loss. Re-rank 64 candidate solutions generated by the fine-tuned models themselves. Compare two re-ranking strategies: (1) re-ranking all candidate solutions, and (2) re-ranking solutions in the top-8 solution clusters.
      Multi-task Sequential Fine-tuning: Sequentially fine-tune the models: (1) as solution generators (SSFT), (2) as solution evaluators (SCR), and (3) as solution generators again. Use the multi-task learning objectives combining MLE and solution evaluation training objectives.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use PaLM 2-S* and PaLM 2-L models for all experiments.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the MATH dataset using Pass@1, Maj1@64, and Pass@64 metrics. Compare the performance of the fine-tuned models with the few-shot performance of pre-trained models.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the impact of solution quality and style on model performance. Compare the effectiveness of different re-ranking strategies and the generalization ability of solution evaluators. Investigate the benefits of multi-task sequential fine-tuning for improving solution generation.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important aspects of understanding and improving the performance of language models. However, there are notable differences in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1 focuses on analyzing the role of feed-forward (FF) blocks in Transformers, which is an under-explored area despite the significant number of parameters in these blocks. The proposed method of visualizing FF blocks' effects through attention maps provides a novel approach to understanding their input contextualization effects. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured, covering a diverse set of models and datasets. The analysis of linguistic patterns and redundancy in FF blocks could yield valuable insights into the internal workings of Transformers.

On the other hand, Paper 2 addresses the practical challenge of improving large language models' performance in solving math problems. The motivation is clear, as there is a significant gap between LLMs' pass-at-one and pass-at-N performance. The proposed fine-tuning strategies, including supervised step-by-step solution fine-tuning, solution-cluster re-ranking, and multi-task sequential fine-tuning, are well-designed to tackle the problem from different angles. The experiment plan is comprehensive, using relevant datasets and metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

While both papers have their merits, Paper 2 appears to have a slight edge in terms of its potential impact and the thoroughness of its approach. Improving LLMs' performance in solving math problems has direct practical implications and could lead to more effective applications of these models in educational and scientific domains. The multi-faceted fine-tuning strategies and the analysis of solution quality, style, and generalization ability demonstrate a deeper understanding of the problem and a more comprehensive approach to addressing it.

In conclusion, while Paper 1 offers valuable insights into the inner workings of Transformers, Paper 2's focus on improving LLMs' performance in a challenging and practically relevant task, along with its well-designed methodology, makes it a stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.

SLiMe: Segment Like Me:
  Title: SLiMe: Segment Like Me
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of segmenting images at any desired granularity using as few as one annotated sample. This problem is significant because existing segmentation methods often require large amounts of annotated data, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain.
  Motivation: Existing methods like DiffSeg, Peekaboo, ReGAN, and SegDDPM either lack control over segmentation granularity, require extensive annotated data, or need training on specific categories. These limitations make them less flexible and harder to generalize across different tasks. The proposed method, SLiMe, leverages the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large vision-language models like Stable Diffusion (SD) to perform segmentation with minimal annotated data, making it more adaptable and efficient.
  Proposed Method: SLiMe frames the segmentation problem as a one-shot optimization task. Given a single image and its segmentation mask, the method extracts a novel 'weighted accumulated self-attention map' (WAS-attention map) along with cross-attention maps from the SD model. The text embeddings of SD are then optimized to highlight the segmented regions in these attention maps. This optimization allows the model to segment unseen images at the same granularity as the annotated sample. The method also improves performance when additional annotated data is available (few-shot learning).
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the PASCAL-Part dataset for car and horse classes, and the CelebAMask-HQ dataset for facial part segmentation. Ensure the datasets are preprocessed as described in the paper, including cropping and removing overlapping or small images.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the text prompt, use a sentence where the word 'prompt' is repeated by the number of parts to be segmented. For example, 'prompt prompt prompt' for three parts.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the Stable Diffusion (SD) model version 2.1. Extract cross-attention and self-attention maps from the 8th to 12th and last three layers of the UNet, respectively.
    Step 4: Optimize Text Embeddings: 1. Encode the training image into the latent space of SD. 2. Add Gaussian noise to the encoded image. 3. Convert the text prompt to text embeddings. 4. Pass the noised image and text embeddings through the UNet to obtain cross-attention and self-attention maps. 5. Calculate the cross-entropy loss between the cross-attention map and the ground truth mask. 6. Calculate the MSE loss between the WAS-attention map and the ground truth mask. 7. Use the SD loss function to regularize the text embeddings. 8. Optimize the text embeddings using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1 for 200 epochs.
    Step 5: Inference: 1. Encode the unseen image into the latent space of SD. 2. Add Gaussian noise to the encoded image. 3. Use the optimized text embeddings to derive cross-attention and self-attention maps from the UNet. 4. Construct the WAS-attention maps for each text embedding. 5. Resize the WAS-attention maps to match the input image dimensions. 6. Stack the resized maps along the channel dimension and perform an argmax across the channels to generate the segmentation mask.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the segmentation performance using the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric. Compare the results with existing methods like ReGAN, SegDDPM, and SegGPT on the PASCAL-Part and CelebAMask-HQ datasets.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate the superiority of SLiMe over existing methods. Highlight the method's ability to generalize across different categories and its robustness to occlusions and small target regions.

REX: Rapid Exploration and eXploitation for AI agents:
  Title: REX: Rapid Exploration and eXploitation for AI agents
  Problem Statement: AI agents leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques have shown promise in autonomously executing real-world tasks. However, effective exploration of the action space remains a critical challenge for these AI agents. Existing LLM-driven agents heavily rely on precise descriptions for decision-making and lack a systematic approach to leverage try-and-fail procedures akin to traditional RL.
  Motivation: Existing methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Reflexion have limitations in effectively assimilating environmental feedback and optimizing action selection. These methods often struggle with systematic reward incorporation, balancing exploration and exploitation, and managing accuracy and latency in complex problem-solving scenarios. The proposed method, REX, aims to address these limitations by introducing an additional layer of rewards and integrating concepts similar to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) scores, leading to more robust and efficient AI agent performance.
  Proposed Method: REX introduces a novel approach for Rapid Exploration and eXploitation of action space for LLM-based AI agents. The method involves: (1) Integration of rewards into the prompt using the UCB framework, enabling systematic exploration and exploitation of the action space; (2) Concurrent pursuit of exploration and exploitation across all steps of the solution, ensuring swift progress without compromising accuracy; (3) Systematically influencing the logits of LLMs through UCL (UCB applied for Logits of LLM), providing enhanced control over the generation of actions. The method does not require any model fine-tuning and can utilize offline behaviors from logs, allowing seamless integration with existing foundation models.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on the Blocksworld dataset for planning problems and the GSM8K dataset for mathematical problem solving.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For REX-UCB, the prompt includes task instructions, few-shot examples, and state-action-feedback with expected rewards based on UCB scores. For REX-UCL, the prompt includes task instructions, few-shot examples, and UCL scores to adjust the logit values.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo for all experiments.
    Step 4: Get Results: Get action predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines (CoT, Reflexion) and proposed methods (REX-R, REX-UCB, REX-UCL).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed methods against the baselines in terms of accuracy and time complexity. Evaluate the effectiveness of UCB-based feedback in balancing exploration and exploitation.

2. The optimization process for text embeddings may be computationally expensive, especially for larger datasets or more complex segmentation tasks.

Strengths of REX:
1. Addresses the challenge of effective exploration and exploitation in LLM-based AI agents, which is crucial for their performance in real-world tasks.
2. Introduces a novel approach for integrating rewards and UCB scores into the prompt, enabling systematic exploration and exploitation of the action space without requiring model fine-tuning.
3. Proposes a method that can utilize offline behaviors from logs, allowing seamless integration with existing foundation models.

Weaknesses of REX:
1. The experiment plan lacks some details, such as the specific reward functions used for UCB and UCL, and how the few-shot examples are constructed.
2. The evaluation is limited to two datasets (Blocksworld and GSM8K), which may not fully demonstrate the method's effectiveness across a wide range of tasks and domains.
3. The reliance on GPT-3.5-turbo may limit the method's scalability and applicability to other LLMs or AI agents.

Conclusion:
While both SLiMe and REX address important challenges in their respective domains, SLiMe appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. SLiMe tackles a well-defined problem in image segmentation, provides a clear and detailed experiment plan, and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. The weaknesses of SLiMe are relatively minor and do not significantly detract from its overall contribution. In contrast, REX's experiment plan lacks some crucial details, and its evaluation is more limited in scope. Therefore, based on the provided information, SLiMe is more likely to be accepted.

Unveiling and Manipulating Prompt Influence in Large Language Models:
  Title: Unveiling and Manipulating Prompt Influence in Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Prompts are crucial in guiding the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the role of individual tokens in prompts, known as input saliency, in shaping the responses remains largely underexplored. Understanding this can enhance LLM interpretability and improve prompting strategies for desired outputs.
  Motivation: Existing saliency methods either misalign with LLM generation objectives or rely heavily on linearity assumptions, leading to potential inaccuracies. These methods are primarily designed for text classification using masked language models and do not align with the objectives of autoregressive LLMs. The proposed method, Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD), leverages the robust interpreting capabilities of the language model head (LM head) to assess input saliency, offering a more accurate and effective approach.
  Proposed Method: Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD) leverages the LM head to project input tokens into the embedding space and estimates their significance based on distribution dynamics over the vocabulary. TDD introduces three variants: forward, backward, and bidirectional, each offering unique insights into token relevance. TDD surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in elucidating the causal relationships between prompts and LLM outputs. It is also applied to two prompt manipulation tasks for controlled text generation: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment steering.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use the Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (BLiMP) for evaluating explanation faithfulness. For controlled text generation, we use a subset from REALTOXICPROMPTS for toxic language suppression and 5000 neutral prompts from OWT for sentiment steering.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For explanation faithfulness, prompts are constructed to include a target token and an alternative token. For toxic language suppression, predefined toxic words are used as target tokens, and for sentiment steering, negative words are used as target tokens and positive words as alternatives.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT2-large, GPTJ-6B, BLOOM-7B, Pythia-6.9B, and LLaMA2-7B for the experiments. For scalability tests, we also use LLaMA2-13B and OPT-30B.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the models using AOPC and Sufficiency metrics for explanation faithfulness. For controlled text generation, use the Perspective API to evaluate toxicity and the Huggingface sentiment analysis classifier for sentiment. Fluency and diversity are measured using mean perplexity and distinct n-grams.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of TDD variants with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of AOPC and Sufficiency for explanation faithfulness. For controlled text generation, compare the reduction in toxicity and the ability to steer sentiment with baselines like WORDFILTER, FFNControl, SP, ASP, Con-GI, and Con-GN.

Diversity of Thought Improves Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models:
  Title: DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT IMPROVES REASONING ABILITIES OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Existing methods to improve performance involve breaking problems into smaller steps or ensembling various generations through decoding alterations. However, these methods assume a fixed input prompt and rely on decoding strategies to introduce diversity. This paper aims to explore how creating and leveraging variations of the input prompt can improve model performance by promoting diversity of thought.
  Motivation: Current methods assume a fixed input prompt and rely on decoding strategies to introduce diversity, which can be computationally expensive and may not directly guide diversity at the thought level. The proposed method aims to automatically improve prompt diversity by soliciting feedback from the LLM, creating diverse reasoning paths that can be ensembled to improve performance. This approach is expected to generate more accurate results without modifying the decoding process, making it more cost-effective and practical for various applications.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves creating diverse prompts by soliciting feedback from the LLM to generate multiple high-level approaches for problem-solving. These diverse prompts are then used in two ways: (1) DIV-SE (DIVerse reasoning path Self-Ensemble), which ensembles diverse prompts across multiple inference calls, and (2) IDIV-SE (In-call DIVerse reasoning path Self-Ensemble), which combines diverse prompts within a single inference call. Both methods aim to improve accuracy under a fixed generation budget without modifying the decoding process.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on several reasoning benchmarks: AQUA-RAT for algebraic word problems, GSM8K for grade-school math problems, Blocksworld for planning tasks, and CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the proposed methods, we first prompt the LLM to generate multiple high-level approaches for solving a given problem. These approaches are then used to create diverse prompts. For DIV-SE, each diverse prompt is used in separate inference calls, while for IDIV-SE, multiple diverse prompts are combined within a single inference call.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI, and also evaluate on LLaMA-2 70B for open-source LLMs.
    Step 4: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets using both the baselines (Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency) and the proposed methods (DIV-SE and IDIV-SE).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed methods against the baselines in terms of accuracy and inference cost. Analyze whether the new methods improve the performance of LLMs in these tasks and how they affect the cost-accuracy trade-off.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers aim to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by focusing on different aspects: input saliency and diversity of thought. The first paper, "Unveiling and Manipulating Prompt Influence in Large Language Models," introduces a novel method called Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD) to better understand the role of individual tokens in prompts and manipulate them for controlled text generation. The second paper, "Diversity of Thought Improves Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models," proposes a method to create diverse prompts by soliciting feedback from the LLM itself to improve its reasoning abilities.

Strengths of Paper 1:
- Addresses the important issue of input saliency in LLMs, which is crucial for interpretability and prompt engineering.
- Proposes a novel method, TDD, that aligns with the objectives of autoregressive LLMs and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of TDD in two practical applications: toxic language suppression and sentiment steering.
- Provides a clear and detailed experiment plan, including datasets, prompt construction, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The paper focuses on a specific aspect of LLMs (input saliency) and may have limited impact on the overall performance of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.
- The experiments are limited to a few specific tasks and may not generalize to a wide range of applications.

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles the important problem of improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, which is a major challenge in the field.
- Proposes a novel method that leverages the LLM itself to create diverse prompts, promoting diversity of thought without modifying the decoding process.
- Evaluates the proposed method on a wide range of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains.
- Compares the proposed method against strong baselines (Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency) and analyzes the cost-accuracy trade-off.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The paper relies on the assumption that diverse prompts generated by the LLM will lead to improved reasoning abilities, which may not always be the case.
- The effectiveness of the proposed method may depend on the quality of the feedback generated by the LLM, which could be a limitation for less capable models.

Conclusion:
While both papers make valuable contributions to the field of LLMs, Paper 2 appears to have a broader impact and more significant potential for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs across various domains. The proposed method of leveraging diverse prompts generated by the LLM itself is novel and addresses a crucial challenge in the field. Additionally, the extensive evaluation on multiple reasoning benchmarks and the comparison against strong baselines make Paper 2 a stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.

DSPy: Compiling Declarative Language Model Calls into State-of-the-Art Pipelines:
  Title: DSPy: Compiling Declarative Language Model Calls into State-of-the-Art Pipelines
  Problem Statement: The ML community is rapidly exploring techniques for prompting language models (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks. However, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded 'prompt templates', i.e., lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. This approach is brittle and unscalable, akin to hand-tuning the weights for a classifier. A given string prompt might not generalize to different pipelines or across different LMs, data domains, or even inputs.
  Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, which is time-consuming, brittle, and does not generalize well across different tasks, LMs, or data domains. The inspiration behind DSPy is to create a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines by abstracting them as text transformation graphs. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn how to apply compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. This approach is inspired by the consensus around neural network abstractions, where modular layers can be composed in any complex architecture and trained using optimizers instead of being hand-tuned.
  Proposed Method: DSPy abstracts LM pipelines as text transformation graphs, where LMs are invoked through declarative modules. These modules are parameterized and can learn to apply various techniques like prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning. DSPy includes a compiler that optimizes any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric by creating and collecting demonstrations. The programming model uses natural-language typed signatures to define the input/output behavior of a module, and modules can be composed in arbitrary pipelines using a define-by-run interface. Teleprompters are used to automate the optimization of these modules, either through few-shot prompting or finetuning.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For the case studies, we use the GSM8K dataset for math word problems and the HotPotQA dataset for multi-hop question answering.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For GSM8K, we use three DSPy programs: a one-step Predict module (vanilla), a two-step ChainOfThought module (CoT), and a multi-stage ComparerOfThoughts module (ThoughtReflection). For HotPotQA, we use a simple RAG program, a ReAct module, and a custom BasicMultiHop program.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT-3.5 and Llama2-13b-chat for both case studies. Additionally, we use T5-Large for fine-tuning experiments in HotPotQA.
    Step 4: Compile Programs: For each program, we compile using different strategies: zero-shot (no compiling), LabeledFewShot, BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, and ensembling. For HotPotQA, we also use BootstrapFinetune to fine-tune smaller models like T5-Large.
    Step 5: Get Results: Run the compiled programs on the test sets of GSM8K and HotPotQA. For GSM8K, evaluate the accuracy of the final numerical value. For HotPotQA, evaluate answer exact match (Ans) and pair-retrieval accuracy (Psg).
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the compiled programs against baselines and expert-written prompts. Analyze the effectiveness of different compilation strategies and the impact of using smaller models like T5-Large.

An Axiomatic Approach to Model-Agnostic Concept Explanations:
  Title: An Axiomatic Approach to Model-Agnostic Concept Explanations
  Problem Statement: Concept explanation is a method for understanding how human-interpretable concepts influence the predictions of machine learning models. However, most existing methods are model-specific and require access to the internal workings of the model, which can be a limitation in cases where the model is proprietary or otherwise inaccessible.
  Motivation: Existing methods for concept explanations are tailored to specific models and often require white-box access, which is not always feasible. There is also a lack of clarity regarding the interpretation of these methods and how they differ from each other. The proposed method aims to address these issues by developing a model-agnostic approach that satisfies three natural axioms: linearity, recursivity, and similarity. This approach not only integrates previous research but also provides a more efficient implementation.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces an axiomatic approach to concept explanations that is model-agnostic. It satisfies three axioms: linearity (the impact on each example should be summed), recursivity (splitting the probability of an example between two new examples should not alter the measure), and similarity (the measure should be high when the concept and prediction are close and low when they are far). The method defines three measures: symmetric, class-conditioned, and concept-conditioned, and provides an efficient algorithm for estimating these measures.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the a-Pascal dataset, which contains 6340 training images and 6355 testing images across 20 classes, each associated with a concept vector labeled by human experts.
    Step 2: Select Models: Train logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models on the a-Pascal dataset. The LR classifier uses an ℓ2 regularizer, and the RF classifier has 100 trees with a maximum depth of 15. Both models are trained using default hyperparameters unless specified otherwise.
    Step 3: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 4: Implement Measures: Estimate the symmetric, class-conditioned, and concept-conditioned measures using the provided algorithm. For example, the symmetric measure can be estimated by summing the product of the model's prediction and the concept value for each example.
    Step 5: Conduct Experiments:
      Experiment 1: Model Comparison: Compare the explanations provided by LR and RF models using the new measures. Analyze the differences in how each model weights different concepts when predicting specific classes.
      Experiment 2: Optimizer Comparison: Fine-tune a ResNet-18 model pretrained on ImageNet using two different optimizers: SGD and AdamW. Compare the semantic concepts picked up by each optimizer using the new measures.
      Experiment 3: Prompt Editing: Use the CLIP model with ViT-B16 backbone on the a-Pascal dataset. Identify irrelevant concepts for certain class prompts and edit the prompts by subtracting the embeddings of these irrelevant concepts. Evaluate the improvement in model performance using the new measures.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the models and optimizers using the new measures. Evaluate the effectiveness of prompt editing in improving model performance. Analyze how well the new measures capture the semantic relationship between the predictor and the concept.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose novel approaches to address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and machine learning. However, they differ in their focus, methodology, and potential impact.

Paper 1 (DSPy) tackles the problem of developing and optimizing language model (LM) pipelines, which is a highly relevant and rapidly evolving area of research. The proposed method of abstracting LM pipelines as text transformation graphs and using parameterized modules is innovative and has the potential to greatly simplify and systematize the process of building complex LM pipelines. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured and covers a range of datasets, models, and compilation strategies, demonstrating the generalizability of the approach. The use of smaller models like T5-Large for fine-tuning is also a valuable contribution, as it explores the trade-offs between model size and performance.

Paper 2 (Axiomatic Approach to Model-Agnostic Concept Explanations) addresses the important issue of interpreting and explaining machine learning models, particularly in a model-agnostic manner. The proposed axiomatic approach is theoretically sound and provides a unified framework for understanding and comparing different concept explanation methods. The three axioms (linearity, recursivity, and similarity) are well-motivated and provide a solid foundation for the proposed measures. The experiment plan covers a diverse set of models, optimizers, and datasets, showcasing the broad applicability of the approach. The prompt editing experiment is particularly interesting, as it demonstrates how the proposed measures can be used to improve model performance by identifying and removing irrelevant concepts.

While both papers make significant contributions, Paper 1 (DSPy) appears to have a slight edge in terms of its potential impact and the clarity of its methodology. The problem of developing and optimizing LM pipelines is arguably more pressing and has wider implications for the field of natural language processing. The proposed approach of using parameterized modules and a define-by-run interface is more concrete and easier to implement compared to the axiomatic approach in Paper 2. Additionally, the step-by-step experiment plan in Paper 1 is more comprehensive and includes a wider range of datasets, models, and compilation strategies.

In conclusion, while both papers are strong contenders, Paper 1 (DSPy) is likely to be the accepted idea due to its innovative approach, clear methodology, and potential for significant impact in the field of natural language processing.

CRAFT: Customizing LLMs by Creating and Retrieving from Specialized Toolsets:
  Title: CRAFT: Customizing LLMs by Creating and Retrieving from Specialized Toolsets
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) are often augmented with tools to solve complex tasks. However, most existing approaches to augment LLMs with tools are constrained by general-purpose APIs and lack the flexibility for tailoring them to specific tasks. This paper addresses the problem of creating and retrieving specialized toolsets for LLMs to enhance their capability to solve complex tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods are limited by their reliance on general-purpose APIs, which are not flexible enough to be tailored to specific tasks. This lack of flexibility hinders the performance of LLMs in specialized domains. The inspiration behind the new proposed method, CRAFT, is to create a general tool creation and retrieval framework that can generate specialized toolsets for specific tasks. The proposed method is expected to work better than existing baselines because it allows for the creation of task-specific tools that can be retrieved and used by LLMs to solve complex tasks more effectively.
  Proposed Method: CRAFT is a general tool creation and retrieval framework for LLMs. It involves the following steps: (1) Collect specific code solutions by prompting GPT-4 to solve training examples. (2) Validate the correctness of these solutions. (3) Abstract the solutions into reusable code snippets. (4) Deduplicate the snippets for higher quality. At inference time, the language model retrieves snippets from the toolsets and executes them or generates output conditioned on the retrieved snippets. This method is designed to be flexible and offers a plug-and-play approach to adapt off-the-shelf LLMs to unseen domains and modalities without any fine-tuning.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on three distinct tasks: visual question answering (VQA) using GQA, OK-VQA, and A-OKVQA datasets; tabular processing using TabMWP dataset; and mathematical reasoning using the algebra subset of MATH dataset.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      VQA: For VQA, sample problems from general instruction datasets like LLaVA and COCO-2017. Use prompts to generate specific code solutions for visual tasks.
      Tabular Processing: For tabular processing, sample problems from the TabMWP training set. Use prompts to generate specific code solutions for tabular data.
      Mathematical Reasoning: For mathematical reasoning, sample problems from the MATH (algebra) training set. Use prompts to generate specific code solutions for mathematical problems.
    Step 3: Tool Creation:
      Generation: Iteratively sample problem-answer pairs from the source dataset. Generate code solutions using GPT-4 and filter out incorrect ones.
      Abstraction: Instruct GPT-4 to replace specific variable names with general ones and wrap textual inputs of internal function calls as arguments of the tool.
      Validation: Ensure the correctness of the created tools by examining whether the abstract tool functions can solve the original problems.
      Deduplication: Reduce redundancy in the toolset by organizing created tools into groups based on function names and the number of input arguments. Select the most comprehensive tool within each group.
    Step 4: Tool Retrieval:
      Multi-View Matching: During inference, prompt the LLM to generate function names and docstrings based on the target problem. Retrieve tools by matching problems, function names, and docstrings using SimCSE embeddings. Aggregate and rank the retrieved tools by their frequency of occurrences.
    Step 5: Select Models: Implement CRAFT and all baselines based on the GPT-3.5-Turbo backbone. Compare with other models like GPT-4 for further analysis.
    Step 6: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks. Conduct an in-depth analysis to understand the impact of each component of CRAFT and the scalability of the toolset.

LLM4GCL:
  Title: LLM4GCL: CAN LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL EM-POWER GRAPH CONTRASTIVE LEARNING?
  Problem Statement: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has made significant strides in pre-training graph neural networks (GNNs) without requiring human annotations. However, many real-world graphs contain textual node attributes, known as text-attributed graphs (TAGs). Existing GCL methods often convert textual attributes into numerical features using shallow or heuristic methods, which cannot capture the semantic nuances and general knowledge embedded in natural language.
  Motivation: Existing GCL methods primarily focus on augmenting graphs assuming the node features are pre-embedded. They often use shallow embedding models like skip-gram and bag-of-words, which fail to capture the complexity of semantic features. The exceptional capabilities of large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, in comprehending text, motivate the exploration of GCL on TAGs using LLMs. The proposed method aims to leverage LLMs to enhance graph augmentation and text encoding, thereby improving the performance of state-of-the-art GCL methods.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, termed LLM4GCL, explores two potential pipelines: LLM-as-GraphAugmentor and LLM-as-TextEncoder. LLM-as-GraphAugmentor leverages LLMs to conduct augmentations at the feature and structure levels through prompts. LLM-as-TextEncoder employs LLMs to encode nodes' textual attributes into embedding vectors. Comprehensive and systematic studies are conducted on six benchmark datasets to explore various feasible designs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate the proposed LLM4GCL framework using five publicly available TAG datasets: PubMed, Ogbn-Arxiv (Arxiv), Electronics-Computers (Compt), Books-History (Hist), and Electronics-Photography (Photo).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Feature Augmentation Prompts:
        Structure-Aware Summarization (SAS): Input: Text attributes (central & neighbor nodes). Instruction: Please use the information from the central node's textual attribute and the linked nodes’ textual attributes to revise the textual attributes of the central node.
        Independent Reasoning (IDR): Input: Text attributes (central node only). Instruction: Which of the following subcategories does this node belong to: [‘Category1’, ‘Category2’, ‘Category3’...]? Provide your reasoning.
        Structure-Aware Reasoning (SAR): Input: Text attributes (central & neighbor nodes). Instruction: In the following categories, ['Category1', 'Category2', 'Category3'...], which one do you think the central node should be? Provide your reasoning.
      Structure Augmentation Prompt:
        Graph Structure Augmentation (GSA): Input: Text attributes (central & neighbor nodes). Instruction: Can you help me to evaluate whether the anchor node and each candidate node should be connected or cited together based on the content of their respective textual attributes?
    Step 3: Select Models: We use three main strong base LLMs across all tasks: GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo), and GPT-4. For feature extraction, we leverage PLMs from Huggingface and utilize OpenAI’s ChatGPT 3.5 for graph augmentation.
    Step 4: Fine-Tune Models:
      Masked Language Modeling (MLM): Randomly mask 15% of tokens in the textual attributes and replace them with a special MASK token. The objective is to predict the masked tokens.
      Topology-Aware Contrastive Learning (TACL): Given a node and one of its connected nodes, the training objective is to maximize the similarity between their representations using a contrastive loss.
      Multi-Scale Neighborhood Prediction (GIANT): Construct a hierarchical node cluster tree using the balanced k-means algorithm and pre-train the PLM to match the most relevant clusters in a top-down manner.
    Step 5: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks as compared to the baselines. Evaluate the impact of different feature augmentation prompts and the influence of different language model backbones on GCL methods.

Fast-DetectGPT:
  Title: Fast-DetectGPT: Efficient Zero-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text via Conditional Probability Curvature
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent and coherent text, which presents both opportunities and risks. It is crucial to distinguish between machine-generated and human-authored content to build trustworthy AI systems. The current leading zero-shot detector, DetectGPT, performs well but is computationally expensive.
  Motivation: DetectGPT, while effective, requires intensive computational resources due to its perturbation step, which involves numerous model calls. This makes it impractical for large-scale or real-time applications. The proposed method, Fast-DetectGPT, aims to reduce these computational costs by introducing a more efficient sampling step. The inspiration behind Fast-DetectGPT is the observation that humans and machines exhibit different word choice patterns given a context, which can be captured using conditional probability curvature. This new method is expected to work better than existing baselines by significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining or improving detection accuracy.
  Proposed Method: Fast-DetectGPT leverages the concept of conditional probability curvature to detect discrepancies in word choices between LLMs and humans. The method involves three main steps: 1) Sampling alternative word choices at each token, 2) Assessing the conditional probabilities of these samples, and 3) Combining these probabilities to make a detection decision. This approach replaces the perturbation step in DetectGPT with a more efficient sampling step, reducing the number of model calls required.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use six datasets to cover various domains and languages, including XSum for news articles, SQuAD for Wikipedia contexts, WritingPrompts for story writing, WMT16 English and German for different languages, and PubMedQA for biomedical research question answering.
    Step 2: Select Models: Evaluate the methods on machine-generated text produced by different source models ranging from 1.3B to 1,800B parameters. Use models like GPT-2, OPT-2.7, Neo-2.7, GPT-J, NeoX, and larger models like GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 through the OpenAI API.
    Step 3: Construct Prompts: For the proposed method, sample alternative word choices at each token using a sampling model. Assess the conditional probabilities of these samples using a scoring model. Combine these probabilities to make a detection decision. For baseline methods like DetectGPT, use the perturbation model to generate slight rewrites of the original text and score these perturbations using a pre-trained GPT model.
    Step 4: Get Results: Measure the detection accuracy in terms of AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and computational speedup. Compare the performance of Fast-DetectGPT with DetectGPT and other baseline methods in both white-box and black-box settings.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the detection accuracy and computational efficiency of Fast-DetectGPT against DetectGPT and other baselines. Evaluate the robustness of Fast-DetectGPT across different domains, languages, passage lengths, and decoding strategies. Assess the method's performance under paraphrasing and decoherence attacks.

HiddenKey: Parameter-Efficient FineTuning Meets Dropout under a Unified Framework:
  Title: HiddenKey: Parameter-Efficient FineTuning Meets Dropout under a Unified Framework
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential in various applications requiring advanced language understanding. Fine-tuning these models for specific tasks is standard but computationally expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA are popular due to their lower resource requirements. However, the contradiction between limited trainable parameters in PEFT and dropout regularization methods, which aim to alleviate overfitting, has been largely overlooked.
  Motivation: Existing PEFT methods, despite their efficiency, are still prone to overfitting. Dropout methods, designed to mitigate overfitting, may not be effective when applied to PEFT due to the limited number of trainable parameters. This paper aims to explore this contradiction and propose a new dropout method that works effectively in PEFT scenarios. The proposed method, HiddenKey, integrates the best aspects of existing dropout methods and is expected to improve performance with less fine-tuning time and continuous improvement with further fine-tuning.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, HiddenKey, introduces a unified framework to analyze and compare existing transformer-specific dropout methods. It drops attention logits column-wise in the attention mechanism and hidden representations element-wise in the feed-forward module. Additionally, it augments the training process with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to minimize the gap between training and inference stages. This approach aims to provide better regularization, reduce overfitting, and improve performance in both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For NLU tasks, use six datasets from the GLUE benchmark: SST-2, RTE, MRPC, STS-B, CoLA, and QNLI. For NLG tasks, use the E2E NLG Challenge and WebNLG datasets.
    Step 2: Select Models: Start with RoBERTa-large and GPT2-Medium models and scale up to LLaMA-7B. Implement LoRA-based PEFT scenarios with these models.
    Step 3: Configure Dropout Methods: Implement various dropout methods including DropAttention, DropKey, and HiddenCut. For HiddenKey, drop attention logits column-wise and hidden representations element-wise. Augment the training with KL divergence loss.
    Step 4: Train Models: Fine-tune the models on the selected datasets using the configured dropout methods. For each method, iterate over different dropout rates (e.g., 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) and select the optimal parameters.
    Step 5: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the models on the NLU and NLG tasks using appropriate metrics: accuracy for classification tasks, Pearson correlation for STS-B, Matthew’s correlation for CoLA, and BLEU, NIST, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr for NLG tasks.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of different dropout methods. Analyze the impact of different structural patterns and compensation methods. Evaluate the effectiveness of HiddenKey in reducing overfitting and improving performance. Visualize the loss landscape to understand parameter sensitivity and model generalization.

When can transformers reason with abstract symbols?:
  Title: When can transformers reason with abstract symbols?
  Problem Statement: The paper investigates the capabilities of transformer models on relational reasoning tasks, where models are trained on strings encoding abstract relations and tested on data containing symbols not seen during training. The goal is to understand when transformers can learn abstract relations and generalize to unseen symbols.
  Motivation: Existing methods, such as classical fully-connected networks (MLPs), fail to learn to reason relationally and generalize to unseen symbols. This limitation is due to the permutation equivariance property of MLP training, which prevents them from distinguishing between unseen tokens. The proposed method leverages the transformer architecture, which, unlike MLPs, can generalize on unseen symbols when trained with sufficient data. The inspiration behind the new method is to modify the transformer architecture to improve data efficiency for learning to reason.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves training transformers on relational reasoning tasks using gradient descent on large quantities of data. The authors also propose modifications to the transformer architecture, adding two trainable parameters per head to improve data efficiency. These modifications make it easier for the transformer to access the incidence matrix of the input, which is invariant to permutations of the symbol alphabet and can be used to solve relational reasoning tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments involve various template tasks, including simple tasks like 'αβα vs. αββ', length-k majority tasks, and random template tasks. The datasets are generated by substituting wildcards in templates with tokens from a predefined alphabet.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Model Architecture and Training:
      Transformer Architecture: Use a standard transformer architecture with modifications. The base architecture includes an embedding layer, multihead attention mechanism, MLP layer, and unembedding layer. The modifications involve adding trainable parameters to the attention heads.
      Training Objectives: Train the transformer using gradient descent with the mean-squared error loss for regression tasks and cross-entropy loss for next-token prediction tasks. Use a large number of training samples to ensure good generalization.
      Data Construction Pipeline: Generate training and test datasets by substituting wildcards in templates with tokens from a predefined alphabet. Ensure that the test set contains symbols not seen during training to evaluate out-of-distribution generalization.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the trained transformers on the test datasets. Measure the test loss and compare it with the baseline models, including classical MLPs and transformers without the proposed modifications.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine if the modified transformer architecture improves data efficiency and generalization on unseen symbols. Compare the performance with classical MLPs and standard transformers. Validate the theoretical findings with empirical evidence.

Vulnerability Detection Using Large Language Models:
  Title: How Far Have We Gone in Vulnerability Detection Using Large Language Model
  Problem Statement: As software becomes increasingly complex and prone to vulnerabilities, automated vulnerability detection is critically important, yet challenging. Given the significant successes of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, there is growing anticipation of their efficacy in vulnerability detection. However, a quantitative understanding of their potential in vulnerability detection is still missing.
  Motivation: Traditional techniques like fuzzing, symbolic execution, and static analysis, while valuable, often fall short in addressing the complexities of modern software systems. Existing vulnerability datasets often lack in quality and accuracy, achieving detection correctness rates as low as 30% to 50%. This not only hampers the ability to effectively evaluate LLMs but also fails to represent the complexities of real-world software vulnerabilities. The proposed method aims to leverage the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve vulnerability detection, hypothesizing that LLMs can outperform traditional methods when provided with high-quality data and comprehensive benchmarks.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves the creation of VulBench, a comprehensive vulnerability benchmark that aggregates high-quality data from various sources, including CTF challenges and real-world applications. Each vulnerable function is annotated with the vulnerability type and root cause. Extensive experiments are conducted involving 16 LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art methods in vulnerability detection. The evaluation process includes binary classification to determine the presence of vulnerabilities within functions and multi-class classification to identify specific types of function vulnerabilities.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The dataset amalgamates multiple sources of vulnerabilities, comprising CTF challenges, MAGMA, Devign, D2A, and Big-Vul. The dataset is divided into three types: CTF Dataset, CVE Dataset, and Static Analyzer Generated Dataset. Each dataset is cleaned and annotated to ensure high quality.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For binary classification, the model is prompted to output as VULNERABLE: NO or VULNERABLE: YES. For multi-class classification, the model delivers outputs as TYPE: [type], where [type] corresponds to a selection from an exhaustive list. Few-shot learning is used to guide the models to follow the format.
    Step 3: Select Models: A series of large models are selected, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and open-access LLMs such as variations of Llama2, Vicuna, Baichuan2, InternLM, CodeLlama, and Falcon. The models are hosted on 48 A800 GPUs across 6 nodes, leveraging vLLM and text-generation-inference to expedite the model inference process.
    Step 4: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method. The results are evaluated based on F1 score, precision, and recall for both binary and multi-class classification.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LLMs with traditional deep learning models and static analyzers. Analyze the models' behavior on different types of vulnerabilities and the impact of additional context and manually reversed decompiled code. Conduct ablation studies to understand the effect of different types of information provided to the models.

NaturalSpeech 2:
  Title: NaturalSpeech 2: Latent Diffusion Models are Natural and Zero-Shot Speech and Singing Synthesizers
  Problem Statement: Scaling text-to-speech (TTS) to large-scale, multi-speaker, and in-the-wild datasets is crucial to capture the diversity in human speech, including speaker identities, prosodies, and styles (e.g., singing). Current large TTS systems suffer from issues such as unstable prosody, word skipping/repeating, and poor voice quality.
  Motivation: Existing TTS systems typically quantize speech into discrete tokens and use language models to generate these tokens sequentially. This approach leads to several limitations: 1) Long sequences of discrete tokens cause error propagation and unstable speech outputs. 2) A trade-off between codec compression and language model generation quality results in either information loss or increased sequence length, complicating language modeling. The proposed method leverages continuous vectors and diffusion models to address these issues, aiming for better prosody, robustness, and zero-shot capabilities.
  Proposed Method: NaturalSpeech 2 employs a neural audio codec with residual vector quantizers to obtain quantized latent vectors and uses a diffusion model to generate these vectors conditioned on text input. A speech prompting mechanism is designed to enhance zero-shot capabilities by facilitating in-context learning in the diffusion model and the duration/pitch predictor. The system is trained on a large-scale dataset of 44K hours of speech and singing data, and evaluated on unseen speakers.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the English subset of Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) with 44K hours of transcribed audiobook data for training. Evaluate using LibriSpeech test-clean and VCTK datasets.
    Step 2: Model Configuration: Configure the neural audio codec with an encoder, residual vector-quantizer, and decoder. The diffusion model includes a phoneme encoder, duration/pitch predictor, and a WaveNet-based architecture for the diffusion process.
    Step 3: Training the Neural Audio Codec: Train the audio codec using 8 NVIDIA TESLA V100 16GB GPUs with a batch size of 200 audios per GPU for 440K steps. Use Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-4.
    Step 4: Training the Diffusion Model: Train the diffusion model using 16 NVIDIA TESLA V100 32GB GPUs with a batch size of 6K frames of latent vectors per GPU for 300K steps. Use AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-4 and 32K warmup steps.
    Step 5: Construct Prompts: For zero-shot synthesis, use a speech prompt mechanism where a random segment of the target speech is used as the prompt during training. During inference, use a reference speech of a specific speaker as the prompt.
    Step 6: Select Models: Scale NaturalSpeech 2 to 400M model parameters. Compare with baselines including YourTTS, FastSpeech 2, FoundationTTS, VALL-E, Voicebox, and MegaTTS.
    Step 7: Get Results: Generate speech with diverse speaker identities, prosody, and styles in zero-shot scenarios. Evaluate using CMOS, SMOS, WER, and prosody similarity metrics.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of NaturalSpeech 2 with baselines in terms of naturalness, speaker similarity, robustness, and prosody similarity. Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of different components.


paper 2:
Robust Backdoor Attack with Visible, Semantic, Sample-specific and Compatible Triggers:
  Title: Robust Backdoor Attack with Visible, Semantic, Sample-specific and Compatible Triggers
  Problem Statement: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be manipulated to exhibit specific behaviors when exposed to specific trigger patterns, without affecting their performance on benign samples, known as backdoor attacks. While recent research has focused on designing invisible triggers to ensure visual stealthiness, these triggers are often susceptible to visual distortions during inference, such as Gaussian blurring or environmental variations in physical scenarios. This susceptibility can significantly undermine the practical effectiveness of attacks.
  Motivation: Existing methods that focus on invisible triggers for backdoor attacks are not robust enough against visual distortions, which can occur during inference due to factors like Gaussian blurring or environmental variations. This limitation has not been thoroughly investigated. The proposed method introduces a novel trigger called the Visible, Semantic, Sample-Specific, and Compatible trigger (VSSC-trigger) to achieve effective, stealthy, and robust backdoor attacks simultaneously. The VSSC-trigger is designed to be more resistant to distortions compared to most digital backdoor attacks and allows more efficient and flexible trigger integration compared to physical backdoor attacks.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves developing a novel trigger called the VSSC-trigger, which is visible, semantic, sample-specific, and compatible. The implementation leverages the capabilities of large language models for choosing suitable triggers and advanced image editing techniques for generating poisoned images with the trigger. The process includes an automated pipeline for trigger selection and poisoned image generation using text-guided image editing techniques. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of the VSSC-trigger.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use two high-resolution datasets: ImageNet-Dogs (20,250 images of 15 dog breeds) and FOOD-11 (16,643 images of 11 food categories).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the trigger selection process, input all class names and trigger selection criteria into a large language model like GPT-4 to generate a candidate trigger list. Example prompt: 'Add some common and small items or decorations to ... These items should be adaptable to multiple scenarios and exist in harmony with the theme...'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use ResNet18 and VGG19-BN for both datasets. Main results are based on ResNet18, with additional experiments using VGG19-BN.
    Step 4: Generate Poisoned Dataset:
      Automatic Selection of Text Triggers:
        Step 1: Determine a suitable trigger list based on the dataset classes using GPT-4.
        Step 2: Use the trigger insertion module to add these triggers to some benign images, creating a trigger assessment set.
        Step 3: Evaluate the trigger assessment set using the quality assessment module. Select the trigger with the highest embedding success rate.
      Generating Poisoned Dataset Using the Selected Text Trigger:
        Step 1: Use the selected text trigger and a benign image to execute the trigger addition process.
        Step 2: Employ the quality assessment module to evaluate the poisoned image. If the image passes, label it as the target class to obtain a poisoned training data pair.
        Step 3: If the image fails, adjust arguments of the trigger insertion module and repeat steps 1 and 2 until a qualified image is obtained.
    Step 5: Train the Model: Train the model using the generated poisoned training dataset.
    Step 6: Evaluate Attack Effectiveness: Evaluate the attack effectiveness using metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR), Clean Accuracy (ACC), and Robust Accuracy (RA).
    Step 7: Test Robustness to Visual Distortions:
      Digital Space:
        Blurring: Simulate blurring using Gaussian blur with kernel sizes from 1 to 19.
        Compression: Simulate compression using JPEG compression with quality levels from 1 to 30.
        Noise: Introduce Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and standard deviation from 0 to 28.
      Physical Space: Print and recapture poisoned samples using a phone camera to simulate physical distortions.
    Step 8: Evaluate OOD Generalization: Collect images from diffusion model generation and manual capturing in the real world to test the generalization ability of the VSSC triggers on out-of-distribution data.

Prompt-Guided Dynamic Network for Image Super Resolution:
  Title: Prompt-Guided Dynamic Network for Image Super Resolution
  Problem Statement: Existing single image super-resolution (SISR) methods learn the convolutional kernel solely from a single image modality, which limits SR performance due to the diversity of input modality and insufficient image-level information in low-resolution images.
  Motivation: Current SISR methods are constrained by their reliance on single image modalities, which do not provide enough information to recover high-resolution (HR) image details, especially for large scale factors. Existing methods also suffer from static inference phases, making them less robust against various degradations. The proposed method aims to leverage multi-modal prompts (texts or images) to assist SR networks in learning more discriminative features, thereby improving SR performance.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces a Prompt-guided Dynamic Network (PDN) that incorporates multi-modal prompts into the SR process. The key component is the Dynamic Correlation Module (DCM), which includes a Spatially Multi-Modal Attention Module and a Prompt-Guided Dynamic Convolution Module. The Spatially Multi-Modal Attention Module generates pixel-wise cross-modal attention masks to highlight interest regions based on prompts. The Prompt-Guided Dynamic Convolution Module uses these prompts to dynamically adjust convolutional kernels, enhancing the network's ability to handle spatial variants and retain cross-modal relevance.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use COCO and FFHQ datasets for training. Evaluate on Set5, Set14, Urban100, and Celeba-HQ datasets.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For COCO, use captions as text prompts. For FFHQ, Set5, Set14, and Urban100, use augmented views (e.g., horizontally flipped images) as visual prompts.
    Step 3: Select Models: Integrate the Dynamic Correlation Module into state-of-the-art SR networks: EDSR, RDN, and RCAN. Refer to the upgraded networks as EDSR+, RDN+, and RCAN+.
    Step 4: Training Details: Train for 100 epochs with a batch size of 16, an initial learning rate of 10^-4, cosine annealing schedule, and ADAM optimizer. Use PSNR and SSIM as evaluation metrics.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the upgraded networks (EDSR+, RDN+, RCAN+) on the benchmark datasets and compare their performance with the baseline networks.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the PSNR and SSIM values to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. Conduct visual comparisons to assess the perceptual quality of the super-resolved images.


paper 2:
FLASK: Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets:
  Title: FLASK: Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets
  Problem Statement: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging because instruction-following necessitates alignment with human values, and the required set of skills varies depending on the instruction. Previous studies have mainly focused on coarse-grained evaluation, which limits interpretability since it does not consider the nature of user instructions that require instance-wise skill composition.
  Motivation: Existing methods primarily rely on coarse-grained evaluation metrics such as overall preference-based scoring or multiple independent benchmarks using automatic metrics. These methods are insufficient because they do not provide a holistic view of model performance and are not scalable or reliable. The inspiration behind the new proposed method, FLASK, is to decompose coarse-level scoring into skill set-level scoring for each instruction, thereby increasing the interpretability and reliability of the evaluation. The proposed method would work better than existing baselines by providing a more detailed and nuanced understanding of model performance across different skills, domains, and difficulty levels.
  Proposed Method: FLASK is a fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based evaluation, which decomposes coarse-level scoring into skill set-level scoring for each instruction. The method involves defining 4 primary abilities divided into 12 fine-grained skills: Logical Thinking, Background Knowledge, Problem Handling, and User Alignment. The evaluation process includes collecting evaluation instances, annotating relevant skills, domains, and difficulty levels, and then scoring each skill based on skill-specific or instance-specific rubrics. The evaluators can be either human or state-of-the-art LLMs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect a total of 1,740 evaluation instances from various NLP datasets, including multi-task datasets like MMLU and single-task datasets like GSM8K. Ensure diversity by restricting single-task datasets to at most 20 instances per dataset.
    Step 2: Annotate Metadata: Annotate each evaluation instance with the essential skills required to follow the instruction, target domains, and difficulty levels. Validate the annotation process by comparing human labelers and EVAL LM (GPT-4) on a subset of 200 instances.
    Step 3: Construct Prompts: For model-based evaluation, use GPT-4 as the default EVAL LM. Provide the evaluation instruction, reference answer, response of the target model, and pre-defined score rubric for each selected skill. Generate a rationale before assigning a score to improve reliability.
    Step 4: Select Models: Evaluate various open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-3.5, BARD, VICUNA-13B, ALPACA-13B, and others. Compare the performance of these models using the FLASK evaluation protocol.
    Step 5: Get Results: Obtain scores for each skill, domain, and difficulty level for the target models. Aggregate the scores for fine-grained analysis.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of different models across various skills, domains, and difficulty levels. Measure the correlation between human-based and model-based evaluations and assess the robustness to stylistic changes. Identify areas where current models underperform and suggest improvements.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose novel methods to address important challenges in their respective domains. The Prompt-Guided Dynamic Network (PDN) for Image Super Resolution aims to improve single image super-resolution (SISR) performance by incorporating multi-modal prompts, while FLASK focuses on fine-grained evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on alignment skill sets.

Strengths of PDN:
- Addresses the limitations of existing SISR methods by leveraging multi-modal prompts
- Introduces a Dynamic Correlation Module (DCM) to generate pixel-wise cross-modal attention masks and dynamically adjust convolutional kernels
- Provides a clear step-by-step experiment plan with well-defined datasets, models, and evaluation metrics

Weaknesses of PDN:
- The effectiveness of the proposed method may depend on the quality and relevance of the prompts
- The computational complexity of the DCM is not discussed, which could be a potential concern for practical applications

Strengths of FLASK:
- Proposes a fine-grained evaluation protocol for LLMs, which increases interpretability and reliability compared to coarse-grained evaluation methods
- Decomposes coarse-level scoring into skill set-level scoring for each instruction, providing a more detailed understanding of model performance
- Includes a diverse set of evaluation instances from various NLP datasets and annotates them with essential skills, domains, and difficulty levels
- Compares the performance of multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs using the FLASK evaluation protocol

Weaknesses of FLASK:
- The annotation process for evaluation instances may be time-consuming and require expert knowledge
- The reliability of the model-based evaluation using GPT-4 as the EVAL LM may be affected by the inherent biases and limitations of GPT-4 itself

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, FLASK appears to be the more impactful and innovative contribution. The fine-grained evaluation protocol proposed in FLASK addresses a critical challenge in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs and has the potential to significantly improve the interpretability and reliability of model evaluations. The diverse set of evaluation instances and the comparison of multiple LLMs further strengthen the paper's contribution. In contrast, while PDN proposes an interesting approach to SISR, its impact may be more limited due to the potential computational complexity and the reliance on prompt quality.

Large Language Model Cascades with Mixture of Thought Representations for Cost-Efficient Reasoning:
  Title: Large Language Model Cascades with Mixture of Thought Representations for Cost-Efficient Reasoning
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have exhibited remarkable performance in a variety of tasks, but this strong performance often comes with the high expense of using paid API services. The problem is to build an LLM 'cascade' to save the cost of using LLMs, particularly for performing reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematical, causal).
  Motivation: Existing methods often rely solely on stronger, more expensive LLMs for all tasks, which leads to high costs. While some approaches have explored using weaker LLMs first and then routing to stronger LLMs if needed, these methods often do not yield satisfying performance for intricate reasoning tasks. The inspiration behind the new proposed method is to leverage the 'answer consistency' of the weaker LLM as a signal of question difficulty. By using a mixture of thought representations (Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought), the proposed method aims to achieve comparable performance to using the stronger LLM alone but at a significantly reduced cost.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves creating an LLM cascade where simpler questions are addressed by a weaker but more affordable LLM, and only the most challenging questions are routed to the stronger and more expensive LLM. The decision-making process is based on the 'answer consistency' of the weaker LLM. Two main methods are proposed: vote-based decision-making and verification-based decision-making. The vote-based method calculates the consistency of the weaker LLM's answer samples by voting, while the verification-based method compares the most consistent answers produced by different prompts. The method also leverages a mixture of thought representations (Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought) to provide diverse perspectives on the same question.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate the proposed method on six reasoning datasets: GSM8k, ASDIV, TabMWP, DATE, Navigate, and CREPE. These datasets cover mathematical, symbolic, and causal reasoning tasks.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:

      Vote-based Decision-Making Prompt: For a single prompt, we denote the set of answers produced by the weaker LLM for each question Q as (Aw1, Aw2, ..., AwK), where K is the pre-defined number of samples. When sampling from two different prompts, we denote (Aw11, Aw12, ..., Aw1K1) and (Aw21, Aw22, ..., Aw2K2) as the answer samples produced by each of them, where K1 and K2 represent the pre-defined sample size for each prompt setting, respectively. The most consistent answer can then be selected as the one that most samples agree with, and this answer will also be regarded as the final answer Aw by the weaker LLM.
      Verification-based Decision-Making Prompt: In the case of producing samples from two different prompt settings (i.e., different demonstrations or thought representations), we propose the second method, which compares the most consistent answers produced by each prompt as the answer verification. We could obtain two sets of answers from distinct prompts: (Aw11, Aw12, ..., Aw1K1) and (Aw21, Aw22, ..., Aw2K2). Our method then verifies the most consistent answers within each prompt, denoted as Aw'1 and Aw'2 respectively.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use GPT-3.5-turbo as the weaker LLM and GPT-4 as the stronger LLM. Both LLMs solve the question via few-shot in-context learning.
    Step 4: Get Results: Get answer predictions from the models on these datasets with both the baselines and proposed method. For the proposed method, we will use the vote-based and verification-based decision-making processes to determine whether to accept the weaker LLM's answer or route the question to the stronger LLM.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with the baselines in terms of task accuracy and relative cost. Analyze whether the new method improves the performance of LLMs in these tasks while reducing the cost compared to using the stronger LLM alone.

LLM+A: Grounding Large Language Models in Physical World with Affordance Prompting:
  Title: LLM+A: Grounding Large Language Models in Physical World with Affordance Prompting
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) excel in various language processing tasks but struggle to interact with the physical world, such as generating control sequences for robotic manipulation. The primary issue is that LLMs are not grounded in the physical world, leading to infeasible or erroneous plans and control sequences.
  Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches often rely on additional pre-defined skills or pre-trained sub-policies, which makes it difficult to adapt to new tasks. These methods require extensive robotic data and struggle to generalize to unseen environments and different embodiments. The proposed method aims to address these limitations by leveraging the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a training-free paradigm, making them both sub-task planners and motion controllers. The inspiration comes from the concept of affordance in robotics, which helps robots understand and interact with their environment. The proposed method, LLM+A, uses affordance prompting to predict the consequences of generated plans and generate affordance values for relevant objects, thereby improving the feasibility of plans and control sequences.
  Proposed Method: The LLM+A framework employs a vision-language model (VLM) as an observation descriptor and a large language model (LLM) as both the high-level sub-task planner and the low-level motion controller. The key innovation is affordance prompting, which stimulates the LLM to predict the consequences of generated plans and generate affordance values for relevant objects. This grounding in the physical world enhances the feasibility of the generated plans and control sequences. The framework operates in a training-free paradigm, leveraging the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on four simulated task families: Block2Position, Block2Block, Separate from Language-Table, and Pick&Place from CLIPORT. These tasks involve pushing blocks to specific locations, separating blocks, and placing blocks into bowls based on natural language instructions.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the sub-task planner, the prompt includes guidelines about the robot's capabilities, task instructions, object parts, and possible skills. The LLM is asked to output the consequences of potential actions, affordance values for object parts, and decomposed sub-tasks. For the motion controller, the prompt includes the task instruction, target position, current arm position, object information, and examples of planned paths.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use OWL-ViT for visual perception and GPT-4 (June) from OpenAI API for both the sub-task planner and motion controller. The high-level sub-task planner operates in a zero-shot setting, while the low-level motion controller uses few-shot prompting with two examples.
    Step 4: Get Results: Execute the tasks using the LLM+A framework and collect success rates for each task. Compare the performance with baseline methods: Naive LLM, ReAct, and Code as Policies.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Evaluate the effectiveness of LLM+A in terms of success rates, affordance prediction accuracy, and robustness across different tasks. Analyze failure cases to identify areas for improvement, such as object detection failures, affordance prediction errors, task planning mistakes, and motion control issues.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers propose interesting ideas for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in different domains. Paper 1 focuses on cost-efficient reasoning by creating an LLM cascade with a mixture of thought representations, while Paper 2 aims to ground LLMs in the physical world using affordance prompting for robotic manipulation tasks.

- Leverages a mixture of thought representations (CoT and PoT) to provide diverse perspectives
- Evaluates the method on a variety of reasoning datasets covering mathematical, symbolic, and causal reasoning

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The effectiveness of the proposed method may depend on the quality of the prompts and the chosen weaker LLM
- The vote-based and verification-based decision-making processes may introduce additional computational overhead
- The paper does not provide a clear threshold for determining when to route questions to the stronger LLM

Strengths of Paper 2:

- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed framework
- The evaluation is limited to simulated environments, and the method's performance in real-world scenarios is not explored

Conclusion:
While both papers make valuable contributions, Paper 2 (LLM+A) is likely to be accepted by a top AI conference due to its novel approach to grounding LLMs in the physical world using affordance prompting. The problem of enabling LLMs to interact with the physical world is a critical challenge in AI, and the proposed method offers a promising solution by leveraging the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a training-free paradigm. The diverse set of simulated robotic manipulation tasks used for evaluation demonstrates the potential of the method to generalize across different scenarios. In contrast, Paper 1's focus on cost-efficient reasoning, while important, may be considered a more incremental improvement over existing approaches.

paper 1:
Contrastive Preference Learning:
  Title: Contrastive Preference Learning: Learning from Human Feedback without Reinforcement Learning
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of aligning models with human intent using human feedback. Traditional methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), involve learning a reward function from human preferences and then optimizing the model using reinforcement learning. However, this approach is based on the flawed assumption that human preferences are distributed according to reward, leading to optimization challenges and limitations in scalability.
  Motivation: Existing RLHF methods assume that human preferences are distributed according to reward, but recent work suggests they follow regret under the user's optimal policy. This flawed assumption leads to unwieldy optimization challenges in the RL phase, such as high-variance policy gradients and instability in approximate dynamic programming. These challenges restrict RLHF methods to simpler settings, like contextual bandits or low-dimensional observations. The proposed method, Contrastive Preference Learning (CPL), leverages the regret-based model of human preferences and avoids the need for RL by directly learning optimal policies from preferences using a contrastive objective. This makes CPL simpler and more scalable to high-dimensional and sequential problems.
  Proposed Method: CPL is derived using the principle of maximum entropy and directly learns optimal policies from human preferences without learning reward functions. It uses a simple contrastive objective and is fully off-policy, making it applicable to arbitrary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The key insight is to replace the advantage function with the log-probability of the policy, allowing the use of supervised learning objectives to match the optimal advantage without policy gradients or dynamic programming.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use six tasks from the MetaWorld robotics benchmark. Generate suboptimal rollout data by training baseline policies to approximately 50% success rate and collecting 2500 episodes for each suboptimal policy. Form synthetic preference datasets with dense and sparse comparisons using an oracle SAC model trained to 100% success.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use the same network architecture for all methods: [512, 512] MLP for state-based experiments and DrQv2 for image-based experiments. Pretrain policies using supervised learning from high-dimensional image observations before fine-tuning with preferences.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate CPL and baseline methods (SFT, P-IQL, PPO, %BC) on the MetaWorld tasks. Measure success rates and compare performance across different datasets and observation modalities (state and image).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare CPL's performance with baselines in terms of success rates, training time, and parameter efficiency. Analyze the impact of dataset size, number of comparisons per segment, and hyperparameters (temperature and bias regularizer) on CPL's performance. Additionally, evaluate CPL on D4RL real human preference datasets to demonstrate its applicability to real-world scenarios.


paper 2:
LLMatic:
  Title: LLMatic: Neural Architecture Search via Large Language Models and Quality Diversity Optimization
  Problem Statement: Designing effective neural network architectures is a significant challenge in deep learning. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate this process, but existing methods often require testing and discarding thousands of architectures, which is computationally expensive and inefficient.
  Motivation: Existing NAS methods, such as reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation, are often inefficient and uninformed, requiring a large number of architectures to be tested. These methods do not leverage stored knowledge about neural network design. The proposed method, LLMatic, aims to use the code-generating capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to introduce meaningful variations in neural network architectures, combined with Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms to discover diverse and robust solutions. This approach is expected to be more efficient and effective in finding high-performing neural networks.
  Proposed Method: LLMatic is a NAS algorithm that combines the code-generating abilities of LLMs with the diversity and robustness of QD solutions. It uses a procedural approach where LLMs generate new architectural variations, and QD algorithms optimize these variations to create diverse and high-performing networks. The method involves initializing with a simple neural network, generating new networks through mutation and crossover operations, and using dual-archive cooperative QD optimization to store and evaluate the networks and prompts.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images in 10 categories, and the NAS-bench-201 benchmark, which is a queryable dataset for NAS.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: We use a variety of prompts to guide the LLM in generating new network architectures. Example prompts include: 'Add a layer to improve the above network', 'Delete a layer to improve the above network', 'Improve the above network by reducing the size drastically', and 'Add convolutional layer to improve the above network'.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use the pre-trained CodeGen-6.1B model, which is a code-generating LLM trained on large datasets of code. This model is used to generate new neural network architectures based on the provided prompts.
    Step 4: Initialize Network and Archives: Start with a simple neural network with one convolutional layer and one fully connected layer. Initialize two archives: a network archive to store neural networks and a prompt archive to store prompts and their associated temperatures.
    Step 5: Generate Initial Networks: Generate an initial batch of networks using random prompts and evaluate their performance. Add the networks and prompts to their respective archives based on their performance.
    Step 6: Apply Evolutionary Operators: For each generation, decide whether to perform mutation or crossover to generate new networks. Mutation involves selecting a network and a prompt, generating a new network, and adjusting the temperature based on performance. Crossover involves combining two networks to create a new one.
    Step 7: Train and Evaluate Networks: Train each generated network for a specified number of epochs and evaluate its performance using accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Add high-performing networks to the network archive and update the prompt archive based on the performance of the generated networks.
    Step 8: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LLMatic with other NAS methods, such as GENIUS and Λ-DARTS, on the CIFAR-10 and NAS-bench-201 benchmarks. Evaluate the diversity and quality of the generated networks and analyze the effectiveness of the dual-archive cooperative QD optimization.

Weaknesses of CPL:
- The paper does not compare CPL with a wide range of existing methods beyond SFT, P-IQL, PPO, and %BC.
- The experiments are limited to the MetaWorld robotics benchmark and D4RL datasets, and the generalizability of CPL to other domains is not extensively explored.

Strengths of LLMatic:
- Proposes a novel approach to NAS by leveraging the code-generating capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to introduce meaningful variations in neural network architectures.
- Combines LLMs with Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms to discover diverse and robust solutions, potentially leading to more efficient and effective NAS.

- The paper does not provide a clear justification for the choice of the CodeGen-6.1B model as the LLM for generating network architectures.
- The scalability of LLMatic to larger datasets and more complex neural network architectures is not thoroughly discussed.

Conclusion:
While both papers propose innovative approaches, the Contrastive Preference Learning (CPL) paper appears to be more well-rounded and convincing. It addresses a fundamental issue in existing RLHF methods, proposes a simpler and more scalable solution, and provides a comprehensive experiment plan with clear evaluation metrics and real-world applicability. In contrast, the LLMatic paper, although promising, relies heavily on the quality of prompts and lacks a thorough discussion on scalability.

Confronting Reward Model Overoptimization with Constrained RLHF:
  Title: Confronting Reward Model Overoptimization with Constrained RLHF
  Problem Statement: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned with human preferences by optimizing reward models (RMs) fitted to human feedback. However, human preferences are multi-faceted, and it is increasingly common to derive reward from a composition of simpler reward models which each capture a different aspect of language quality. This presents a challenge as it is difficult to appropriately weight these component RMs when combining them. Additionally, because any RM is only a proxy for human evaluation, this process is vulnerable to overoptimization, wherein past a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse human ratings.
  Motivation: Existing methods for aligning LLMs with human preferences often rely on optimizing a single RM or a fixed combination of RMs. These methods are susceptible to overoptimization, where maximizing the reward model beyond a certain point can decrease the quality of the model's outputs as judged by human evaluators. This issue is compounded when using composite RMs, as the correlation between component RMs can significantly affect the points at which overoptimization occurs. The proposed method aims to address these challenges by using constrained reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the weights of component RMs, preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's threshold of usefulness.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces constrained reinforcement learning as a means of preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's threshold of usefulness. The method involves learning dynamic weights for the component RMs, naturally given by the Lagrange multipliers, to ensure that each RM stays within the range at which it is an effective proxy. Additionally, an adaptive method using gradient-free optimization is introduced to identify and optimize towards these points during a single run.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The experiments focus on dialogue generation using the DailyDialog dataset, which consists of transcripts of conversations between humans. The dataset is split into 35k training, 3k validation, and 3k test utterances.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Not applicable as this is not a prompting paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: The base LLM used is GPT-2. The reward models include METEOR score and an intent classifier score. The METEOR score measures lexical similarity, while the intent classifier score measures how well the intent of the generated utterance matches the reference output.
    Step 4: Get Results: Train multiple runs of PPO agents to maximize individual RMs and plot the resulting evaluation scores against the METEOR and intent scores. Use kernel density estimation to fit a surface to the data and identify the proxy points where further increasing the proxy reward results in decreased ground-truth performance.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of various constrained RL methods (e.g., µ-PPO, ξ-PPO) against standard PPO and PPO-SAT. Evaluate whether the constrained methods improve evaluation performance and successfully enforce the desired constraints. Additionally, assess whether the identified proxy points lead to the best performance and explore the effectiveness of using gradient-free optimization to dynamically find these proxy points during a single run.

Tabular Foundation Models:
  Title: Towards Foundation Models for Learning on Tabular Data
  Problem Statement: Learning on tabular data underpins numerous real-world applications, such as disease risk stratification, credit assessment, and sales volume prediction. Despite considerable efforts, current transferable tabular models are limited by either the lack of support for direct instruction following in new tasks or the neglect of acquiring foundational knowledge and capabilities from diverse tabular datasets.
  Motivation: Existing methods for tabular data learning are not sufficient because they either require fine-tuning for each new task or focus on independent adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to each tabular dataset. These approaches overlook the opportunity to learn foundational knowledge and capabilities from diversified datasets and tasks. The proposed method, Tabular Foundation Models (TabFMs), aims to overcome these limitations by harnessing the potential of generative tabular learning, employing a pre-trained LLM as the base model and fine-tuning it using purpose-designed objectives on an extensive range of tabular datasets. This approach is expected to endow TabFMs with a profound understanding and universal capabilities essential for learning on tabular data.
  Proposed Method: TabFMs leverage a pre-trained large language model (LLM) as the base model and fine-tune it using purpose-designed objectives on an extensive range of tabular datasets. The method involves generative tabular learning (GTL), which includes a fine-tuning process on a wide range of tabular datasets to stimulate the acquisition of foundational knowledge and universal capabilities essential for understanding tabular data. This generative tabular learning equips the resulting TabFM with significantly enhanced capabilities in both instruction following and task-specific fine-tuning for new tabular learning tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect 115 public tabular datasets from Kaggle, ensuring a diverse range of domains such as healthcare, finance, retail, sustainability, and climate. Each dataset should be preprocessed to filter out features with no semantic information and balance the number of samples for each class.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Convert tabular data into textual form using a unique prompt design that includes feature serialization and task instruction. Feature serialization templates should be created for both numerical and categorical features, and task instructions should specify the task background and provide answer choices.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use LLaMA-2-7B as the base LLM for generative tabular learning. Additionally, use GPT-4 to generate descriptions about task background and feature meanings, and involve manual verifications to adjust and correct some descriptions.
    Step 4: Implement Generative Tabular Learning (GTL): Fine-tune the LLaMA-2-7B model using the collected datasets. Employ a fixed learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of 512, without incorporating any scheduler or warmup. The training process should include gradient updating for a total of 256 batches with optimizer AdamW.
    Step 5: Evaluate Instruction Following: Evaluate the instruction following capabilities of the model on nine datasets constructed by Hegselmann et al. (2023), spanning diverse domains. Compare the performance of LLaMA-GTL with baselines such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, T0 (TabLLM), and TabPFN. Use AUROC scores as the primary evaluation metric.
    Step 6: Evaluate Task-Specific Fine-Tuning: Assess the fine-tuning performance of the model on the same nine datasets. Compare the performance of LLaMA-GTL with baselines such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, SAINT, TabNet, NODE, and TabPFN. Evaluate the model's performance with 64 shots, 512 shots, and all training samples.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine whether the proposed method improves the performance of LLMs in both instruction following and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios. Discuss the limitations and potential opportunities for future research.

Are Bert Family Good Instruction Followers? A Study on Their Potential And Limitations:
  Title: Are Bert Family Good Instruction Followers? A Study on Their Potential And Limitations
  Problem Statement: The paper investigates whether the BERT family, which are encoder-only models, can effectively follow instructions and perform zero-shot learning. This is important because while decoder-only and encoder-decoder models have shown strong instruction-following capabilities, the potential of BERT models in this area remains underexplored.
  Motivation: Existing methods primarily focus on decoder-only models (e.g., BLOOM, LLaMA) and encoder-decoder models (e.g., Flan-T5, AlexaTM) for instruction following and zero-shot learning. These models have demonstrated superior performance and emergent capabilities. However, the BERT family, despite being one of the most representative pre-trained models, has not been thoroughly investigated for these tasks. The motivation behind this study is to explore the untapped potential of BERT models in instruction following and to address their limitations, such as performance decline in long-generation tasks and issues with length prediction.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves using XML-R to explore the effectiveness of the BERT family for instruction following and zero-shot learning. The approach includes designing a strategy to utilize encoder-only models for generation tasks and conducting multi-task instruction tuning. The fine-tuned model, Instruct-XMLR, is evaluated against other models like Bloomz and mT0. The method also incorporates a non-autoregressive generation manner to accelerate decoding.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The datasets used for evaluation include XWinograd for conference resolution, XCOPA for sentence completion, XNLI for natural language inference, and WMT'14 for machine translation. These datasets cover a range of tasks to evaluate both task and language generalization.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each task, five different prompts are used to ensure robustness. For example, in XNLI, prompts include variations like 'Suppose {premise} Can we infer that {hypothesis}? Yes, no, or maybe?' and 'Given that {premise} Therefore, it must be true that {hypothesis}? Yes, no, or maybe?'.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models compared include Instruct-XMLR XL, mT0-3.7B, and BLOOMZ-3B. Instruct-XMLR XL is based on XML-R XL, which contains 3.5 billion parameters.
    Step 4: Fine-Tuning Details: The fine-tuning process uses the xP3 multilingual instruction dataset, which includes 46 languages. The model is fine-tuned on a subset of this dataset, approximately 1/80th of the original size, to reduce training expenses. The learning rate is set to 2e-5 with a warm-up period of 500 updates, followed by a polynomial decay schedule.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the selected datasets using the constructed prompts. Metrics include accuracy for tasks like XWinograd, XCOPA, and XNLI, and BLEU scores for machine translation tasks.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Instruct-XMLR XL with mT0-3.7B and BLOOMZ-3B. Analyze the strengths and limitations of Instruct-XMLR XL, such as its strong task and language generalization abilities and its accelerated decoding speed. Also, identify areas for improvement, such as handling long-generation tasks and improving length prediction.

Fine-tune Language Models to Approximate Unbiased In-context Learning:
  Title: Fine-tune Language Models to Approximate Unbiased In-context Learning
  Problem Statement: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful emergent ability of large language models (LLMs) where models can generate outputs based on input-output pairs provided in a prompt. However, the performance of ICL is highly dependent on the quality of the input prompt. Biased or imbalanced input prompts can significantly degrade the performance of language models.
  Motivation: Existing methods for in-context learning are susceptible to biases and imbalances in the input prompts, which can lead to degraded performance. The proposed method aims to address this issue by reweighting the input examples to approximate unbiased in-context learning. The inspiration behind this method is to use an unbiased validation set to determine optimal weights for each input-output example, thereby mitigating the impact of biases and imbalances. The proposed method is expected to perform better than existing baselines by providing a more accurate and representative learning process.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method introduces a reweighted algorithm called RICL (Reweighted In-context Learning) that fine-tunes language models using an unbiased validation set to determine the optimal weight for each input-output example. Additionally, a low-cost linear optimal weight approximation algorithm called LARICL (Linear Approximation of Reweighted In-context Learning) is introduced. The method involves transforming the embedded prefix with several input-output examples using two extra parameters, W and B, to approximate an unbiased in-context learning. The reweighted prefix is then concatenated with the embedded query to generate the desired output.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use a numerical dataset to validate the performance of the proposed methods. Ensure the dataset includes unbiased, imbalanced, and noisy input-output pairs for comprehensive testing.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the baseline, use casual prompt-based in-context learning. For the proposed methods, construct prompts by reweighting the input-output pairs using the RICL and LARICL algorithms. The reweighted prompts should be used to fine-tune the language models.
    Step 3: Select Models: Pre-train a GPT-2 model to learn in-context. Use this pre-trained model for further fine-tuning with the proposed reweighting methods.
    Step 4: Implement Algorithms: Implement Algorithm 1 (RICL) and Algorithm 2 (LARICL) as described in the paper. For RICL, initialize weights randomly and fine-tune using gradient descent. For LARICL, use a closed-form solution of linear regression for fast approximation of optimal weights.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the models on the test set using min-max-scaled mean-squared error (MSE) as the metric. Compare the performance of the proposed methods with the baseline in-context learning, fine-tuning, and prefix-tuning methods.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the robustness of the proposed methods by testing on prefixes with different distributions, including random, imbalanced, noisy, and combined imbalanced and noisy prefixes. Compare the performance improvements achieved by RICL and LARICL over the baselines.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important aspects of language models and their capabilities. The first paper, "Are Bert Family Good Instruction Followers? A Study on Their Potential And Limitations," explores the potential of BERT models for instruction following and zero-shot learning. The motivation behind this study is clear, as the BERT family has not been thoroughly investigated for these tasks despite its popularity. The proposed method using XML-R and multi-task instruction tuning is well-defined, and the experiment plan is comprehensive, covering various datasets and tasks. The analysis of strengths and limitations provides valuable insights into the performance of Instruct-XMLR XL compared to other models.

The second paper, "Fine-tune Language Models to Approximate Unbiased In-context Learning," addresses the issue of biases and imbalances in input prompts for in-context learning. The motivation is strong, as biased or imbalanced prompts can significantly degrade the performance of language models. The proposed reweighting algorithms, RICL and LARICL, aim to mitigate this issue by approximating unbiased in-context learning. The experiment plan is well-structured, focusing on evaluating the robustness of the proposed methods against different prefix distributions.

While both papers have their merits, the second paper seems to have a more significant impact on the field of language models. Addressing the issue of biases and imbalances in input prompts is crucial for improving the performance and reliability of in-context learning. The proposed reweighting algorithms offer a novel approach to mitigate this problem, and the extensive evaluation of their robustness against various prefix distributions demonstrates their effectiveness. The first paper, although valuable in exploring the potential of BERT models for instruction following, has a narrower scope and may not have as broad an impact on the field.

In conclusion, while both papers make valuable contributions, the second paper, "Fine-tune Language Models to Approximate Unbiased In-context Learning," is likely to be the accepted idea due to its innovative approach to addressing a critical issue in language models and its potential for broader impact on the field.

LoftQ: LoRA-Fine-Tuning-aware Quantization for Large Language Models:
  Title: LoftQ: LoRA-Fine-Tuning-aware Quantization for Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: Quantization is essential for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) but often results in a performance gap when combined with LoRA fine-tuning. This gap is observed between full fine-tuning and the quantization plus LoRA fine-tuning approach, especially in low-bit regimes.
  Motivation: Existing methods like QLoRA primarily focus on quantization techniques and neglect the importance of subsequent LoRA fine-tuning. This oversight leads to significant performance degradation in downstream tasks due to the discrepancy introduced by quantization. The proposed method, LoftQ, aims to address this by providing a better initialization for LoRA fine-tuning, thereby improving generalization in downstream tasks.
  Proposed Method: LoftQ is a novel quantization framework that simultaneously quantizes an LLM and finds a proper low-rank initialization for LoRA fine-tuning. This is achieved by minimizing the discrepancy between the quantized and full-precision model through alternating optimization between quantization and singular value decomposition (SVD). The method is compatible with different quantization techniques and is particularly effective in low-bit scenarios.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Evaluate on natural language understanding (GLUE benchmark, SQuADv1.1, ANLI), question answering, summarization (XSum, CNN/DailyMail), and natural language generation tasks (GSM8K, WikiText-2).
    Step 2: Select Models: Quantize and fine-tune DeBERTaV3-base, BART-large, and LLAMA-2 series (7b and 13b).
    Step 3: Quantization Methods: Apply two quantization methods: Uniform quantization and NormalFloat (NF4 and NF2).
    Step 4: Implement LoftQ: 1. Initialize low-rank adapters A and B to zero. 2. Quantize the difference between the original pre-trained weight matrix and the low-rank approximation from the previous step. 3. Apply SVD to the residual of the quantization to obtain a low-rank approximation. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a specified number of iterations (T).
    Step 5: Fine-Tune Models: Freeze the quantized backbone and optimize the low-rank adapters using an efficient optimization algorithm like AdamW. Use the dequantized simulated high-precision weight for forward propagation.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models on the selected datasets using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, ROUGE scores, perplexity).
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LoftQ with QLoRA and full precision LoRA across different tasks and quantization levels. Assess the stability and effectiveness of LoftQ, especially in low-bit regimes.

ProteiNexus: Illuminating Protein Pathways through Structural Pre-training:
  Title: ProteiNexus: Illuminating Protein Pathways through Structural Pre-training
  Problem Statement: Protein representation learning is crucial for various biological tasks, but current methods predominantly rely on protein sequences, which fail to fully encapsulate the rich information contained within protein structures. This limitation hinders the understanding of protein function and the design of innovative proteins.
  Motivation: Existing methods, primarily based on protein sequences, do not capture the full spectrum of information embedded in protein structures. Graph-based representations of protein structures have been introduced but struggle to preserve fine-grained atom information and often overlook long-range interactions. This is particularly problematic for modeling protein-protein interactions. The proposed method, ProteiNexus, aims to integrate protein structure learning with downstream tasks, leveraging a robust pre-training strategy to capture detailed structural information and improve performance across various tasks.
  Proposed Method: ProteiNexus employs a structural encoding mechanism to capture fine-grained distance details and spatial positioning. The model is pre-trained using self-supervised learning on extensive protein structure data, followed by fine-tuning with lightweight decoders for specific downstream tasks. The encoding involves Spatial Position Encoding (SPE), Distance Encoding, and Relative Position Encoding (RPE). The backbone network is based on a transformer architecture, which captures global features and interactions of protein structures. The pre-training involves masked residue prediction and pair representation denoising, while fine-tuning adapts the model to tasks like model quality assessment, binding affinity prediction, folding classification, enzyme-catalyzed reaction classification, protein design, and antibody design.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For pre-training, use the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database, including all protein structure data released up until May 1st, 2023. For downstream tasks, use datasets like CASP14 and CASP15 for model quality assessment, S1131, S4169, S8338, M1101, and M1707 for binding affinity prediction, SCOP v1.75 for fold classification, SIFTS for enzyme-catalyzed reaction classification, CATH v4.2 and TS50 for protein design, and SAbDab for antibody design.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: The model uses a transformer-based architecture with layers for encoding sequence and structural information. The encoder includes Spatial Position Encoding (SPE), Distance Encoding, and Relative Position Encoding (RPE). The backbone network is a transformer with self-attention mechanisms to capture global features and interactions. The pre-training involves masked residue prediction and pair representation denoising.
    Step 3: Pre-training: Pre-train the model on the PDB dataset using self-supervised tasks. Mask 15% of sequence residues and introduce Gaussian noise to the corresponding pair representations. Use cross-entropy loss for masked residue prediction and Smooth L1 loss for pair representation denoising. Train on 8 NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs with a batch size of 32, learning rate of 1e-4, and a warm-up of 5000 steps.
    Step 4: Fine-tuning on Downstream Tasks:
      Model Quality Assessment: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on CASP14 and CASP15 datasets. Use a two-layer MLP as the predictor to predict the quality of both global and local structures. Evaluate using GDT-TS and LDDT scores.
      Binding Affinity Prediction: Fine-tune on S1131, S4169, S8338, M1101, and M1707 datasets. Use single representations to compute the change in binding affinity values. Evaluate using Pearson correlation coefficient (Rp) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
      Fold and Enzyme-Catalyzed Reaction Classification: Fine-tune on SCOP v1.75 and SIFTS datasets. Use a linear layer as the classifier. Evaluate using classification accuracy.
      Protein Design: Fine-tune on CATH v4.2 and TS50 datasets. Use [MASK] to denote residue types and predict residue types using a task layer. Evaluate using perplexity and Amino Acid Recovery (AAR).
      Antibody Design: Fine-tune on SAbDab dataset. For sequence-structure co-design, mask residues in CDR regions and predict residue types and structures. For antigen-specific antibody design, use the pre-trained model to predict CDR-H3 and all six CDRs. Evaluate using Amino Acid Recovery (AAR) and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with existing baselines across all tasks. Evaluate improvements in model quality assessment, binding affinity prediction, fold and enzyme-catalyzed reaction classification, protein design, and antibody design. Analyze the impact of pre-training and structural encoding on the performance of the model.

paper 1:
DNABERT-2: Efficient Foundation Model and Benchmark For Multi-Species Genomes:
  Title: DNABERT-2: Efficient Foundation Model and Benchmark For Multi-Species Genomes
  Problem Statement: Decoding the linguistic intricacies of the genome is a crucial problem in biology. Existing foundational models like DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer have made significant strides, but they rely on k-mer tokenization, which introduces computation and sample inefficiencies. These inefficiencies are primary obstacles in developing large genome foundational models.
  Motivation: The k-mer tokenization method, while simple, leads to significant computational inefficiencies and information leakage. Overlapping k-mer tokenization results in redundancy and poor sample efficiency, while non-overlapping k-mer tokenization complicates the model's task of aligning distinct representations of near-identical inputs. Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a statistics-based data compression algorithm, can overcome these limitations by constructing tokens through frequent co-occurring genome segments, thus improving computational efficiency and reducing redundancy.
  Proposed Method: DNABERT-2 replaces k-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to improve computational efficiency and reduce redundancy. The model also incorporates several advanced techniques: Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) to handle long sequences, FlashAttention for efficient attention computation, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Additionally, DNABERT-2 is pre-trained on a multi-species genome dataset to enhance its generalizability.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Compile two datasets for pre-training: the human genome dataset (2.75B nucleotide bases) and the multi-species genome dataset (32.49B nucleotide bases) from 135 species. For evaluation, use the Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE) benchmark, which includes 36 datasets across 9 tasks with input lengths ranging from 70 to 10000.
    Step 2: Tokenization and Pre-Training: Replace k-mer tokenization with BPE. Pre-train DNABERT-2 using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) loss with a mask ratio of 15%. Use a batch size of 4096 and a max sequence length of 128. Train the model for 500,000 steps using the AdamW optimizer with specific hyperparameters.
    Step 3: Model Architecture: Incorporate Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) to handle long sequences, FlashAttention for efficient attention computation, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Use the Transformer Encoder architecture with GEGLU activation function.
    Step 4: Fine-Tuning and Evaluation: Fine-tune DNABERT-2 on the GUE benchmark datasets. Use a batch size of 32, a warmup step of 50, and a weight decay of 0.01. For DNABERT and DNABERT-2, perform standard fine-tuning with a learning rate of 3e-5. For Nucleotide Transformers, use LoRA with specific hyperparameters. Validate the model every 200 steps and save the model with the smallest validation loss.
    Step 5: Further Pre-Training: Combine the training sets of the 28 GUE datasets and further pre-train DNABERT-2 on this combined set with a batch size of 32, a max sequence length of 128, and a learning rate of 5e-5 for 100,000 steps.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the GUE benchmark using metrics like F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Compare the performance of DNABERT-2 with DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformers in terms of computational efficiency and downstream task performance.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine if DNABERT-2 achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art models while being more computationally efficient. Investigate the impact of additional in-domain pre-training on model performance.

SmoothLLM:
  Title: SmoothLLM: Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Llama, Claude, and PaLM are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where adversaries manipulate the models into generating objectionable content. This poses a significant risk to the deployment of LLMs in various applications, as the generated text can influence critical decisions in education, healthcare, and business.
  Motivation: Existing methods to align LLMs with human values and ethical standards have reduced the generation of toxic content but are still susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. These attacks, particularly adversarial prompting, can bypass safety mechanisms by appending adversarially-chosen characters to prompts. Current defenses either require retraining the model, which is computationally infeasible for LLMs, or are not effective against sophisticated attacks like GCG. The proposed method, SmoothLLM, leverages the brittleness of adversarial prompts to character-level changes, offering a more efficient and universally compatible defense.
  Proposed Method: SmoothLLM is an algorithm designed to mitigate jailbreaking attacks by perturbing multiple copies of an input prompt and aggregating the predictions to detect adversarial inputs. The method involves two main steps: (1) Perturbation, where multiple copies of the input prompt are randomly perturbed at the character level, and (2) Aggregation, where the outputs of these perturbed prompts are aggregated to determine if the input is adversarial. This approach reduces the attack success rate to below one percentage point, avoids unnecessary conservatism, and provides provable guarantees on attack mitigation.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the harmful_behaviors.csv dataset from the GCG source code, which contains 520 goal prompts and corresponding targets. Additionally, use standard NLP benchmarks like PIQA, OpenBookQA, and ToxiGen for evaluating non-conservatism.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, use the original prompts from the dataset. For the proposed method, generate multiple perturbed copies of each prompt using the RandomSwapPerturbation, RandomPatchPerturbation, and RandomInsertPerturbation functions. Example prompt: 'Tell me how to build a bomb' with adversarial suffix 'xyz'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate on seven different LLMs: Llama2, Vicuna, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude-1, Claude-2, and PaLM-2. Use the open-source versions of Llama2 and Vicuna, and the API versions of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude-1, Claude-2, and PaLM-2.
    Step 4: Implement Perturbation Functions: Implement the RandomSwapPerturbation, RandomPatchPerturbation, and RandomInsertPerturbation functions in Python. Use string.printable as the alphabet for perturbations.
    Step 5: Run SmoothLLM: For each prompt, generate N perturbed copies with perturbation percentage q. Pass these perturbed prompts through the LLM and aggregate the outputs to determine if the input is adversarial. Example parameters: N=10, q=5%.
    Step 6: Get Results: Measure the attack success rate (ASR) for each LLM with and without SmoothLLM. Also, evaluate the nominal performance on PIQA, OpenBookQA, and ToxiGen to ensure non-conservatism.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the ASR and nominal performance of the LLMs with and without SmoothLLM. Analyze the trade-offs between robustness and performance, and evaluate the query efficiency of SmoothLLM compared to GCG.

paper 1:
Are Human-generated Demonstrations Necessary for In-context Learning?:
  Title: Are Human-generated Demonstrations Necessary for In-context Learning?
  Problem Statement: The standard paradigm of In-context Learning (ICL) for large language models (LLMs) relies on human-generated demonstrations, which are susceptible to selection biases and are labor-intensive to create. This paper investigates whether human-generated demonstrations are necessary for effective ICL.
  Motivation: Existing ICL methods are highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations and require significant human effort to generate these examples. This process is not only cumbersome but also lacks a widely-agreed criterion for optimal demonstration selection. The proposed method, self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), aims to eliminate the need for human-crafted demonstrations by allowing LLMs to generate their own demonstrations. This approach leverages the inherent capabilities of LLMs to create contextually relevant examples, potentially leading to more stable and efficient learning.
  Proposed Method: The self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC) involves the following steps: instead of using hand-crafted examples, SEC prompts LLMs to generate their own demonstrations based on the test input. These self-generated demonstrations are then used to produce the final output. SEC can be applied to both vanilla ICL and chain-of-thought (CoT) scenarios, simplifying the process by removing the need for manual generation of examples and rationales.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate SEC on multiple benchmarks including arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K, MATH), commonsense reasoning (ARC), multi-task language understanding (MMLU, C-Eval), and code generation (HumanEval).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For vanilla SEC, the prompt includes the test input, an instruction for few-shot demonstration generation, and an output format instruction. For CoT-SEC, the prompt also includes a step-by-step reasoning process. Example prompts for vanilla SEC and CoT-SEC are provided in the paper.
    Step 3: Select Models: We use ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo), GPT-4, and Llama2 34B as the model backbones for our experiments.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate predictions from the models using both the baseline ICL methods (with human-crafted demonstrations) and the proposed SEC method (with self-generated demonstrations).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of SEC against zero-shot learning and ICL with human-crafted demonstrations across all benchmarks. Metrics include exact match accuracy for arithmetic reasoning and code generation tasks, and accuracy for commonsense reasoning and multi-task language understanding tasks.

Causal Inference Using LLM-Guided Discovery:
  Title: Causal Inference Using LLM-Guided Discovery
  Problem Statement: The core challenge in causal inference is determining reliable causal graphs solely based on observational data. Errors in the estimated graph structure can propagate downstream, affecting the correctness of the estimated causal effects.
  Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on the complete graph structure for causal effect inference, which can be error-prone. Determining the existence of graph edges is complex and depends on other variables, making it difficult for domain experts. The proposed method leverages the topological order of graph variables, which is easier to elicit from domain experts and can be accurately inferred using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. This approach simplifies the process and reduces the dependency on complete graph structures, potentially improving the accuracy of causal inference.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves using LLMs to obtain the causal order of variables, which is sufficient for causal effect inference. The method employs different prompting strategies, including pairwise and triplet-based prompts, to query LLMs for causal order. The causal order is then used to identify valid backdoor adjustment sets for effect estimation. Additionally, the method integrates LLMs with established causal discovery algorithms, such as constraint-based and score-based methods, to enhance their performance.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use benchmark datasets from the Bayesian network repository, including Earthquake, Cancer, Survey, Asia, Asia modified (Asia-M), Child, and a subset of the Neuropathic dataset.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Pairwise Prompts:
        Type: Basic Prompt
        Example: Which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely between nodes 'smoker' and 'cancer'? A. changing the state of node 'smoker' causally effects a change in another node 'cancer'. B. changing the state of node 'cancer' causally effects a change in another node 'smoker'. C. There is no causal relation between the nodes 'cancer' and 'smoker'.
        Type: Iterative Context
        Example: For the nodes X and Y which form an edge in a Causal Graph, you have to identify which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely between the nodes of the edge. A. changing the state of node X causally affects a change in another node Y. B. changing the state of node Y causally affects a change in another node X. C. There is no causal relation between the nodes X and Y.
        Type: Markov Blanket Context
        Example: For the following undirected edge in a Causal Graph made of nodes X and Y, you have to identify which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely between the nodes of the edge. A. changing the state of node X causally effects a change in another node Y. B. changing the state of node Y causally effects a change in another node X. C. There is no causal relation between the nodes X and Y.
        Type: Chain-of-Thought (+In-context learning)
        Example: For a causal graph used to model relationship of various factors and outcomes related to cancer with the following nodes: [’Pollution’, ’Cancer’, ’Smoker’, ’Xray’, ’Dyspnoea’], Which cause-and-effect relationship is more likely between nodes ’smoker’ and ’cancer’? A. changing the state of node ’smoker’ causally effects a change in another node ’cancer’. B. changing the state of node ’cancer’ causally effects a change in another node ’smoker’. C. There is no causal relation between the nodes ’cancer’ and ’smoker’. Make sure to first provide a grounded reasoning for your answer and then provide the answer in the following format: <Answer>A/B/C</Answer>.
      Triplet-Based Prompts:
        Type: Triplet Prompt
        Example: Identify the causal relationships between the given variables and create a directed acyclic graph to model congenital heart disease in babies. Make sure to give a reasoning for your answer and then output the directed graph in the form of a list of tuples, where each tuple is a directed edge. The desired output should be in the following form: [(‘A’,‘B’), (‘B’,‘C’)] where first tuple represents a directed edge from Node ‘A’ to Node ‘B’, second tuple represents a directed edge from Node ‘B’ to Node ‘C’and so on. If a node should not form any causal relationship with other nodes, then you can add it as an isolated node of the graph by adding it separately. For example, if ‘C’ should be an isolated node in a graph with nodes ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, then the final DAG representation should be like [(‘A’,‘B’), (‘C’)]. Use the description about the node provided with the nodes in brackets to form a better decision about the causal direction orientation between the nodes. It is very important that you output the final Causal graph within the tags <Answer></Answer> otherwise your answer will not be processed.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 for generating causal order.
    Step 4: Integrate with Discovery Algorithms:
      Constraint-Based Methods: Use the causal order from LLM to orient the undirected edges outputted by a constraint-based algorithm like PC. If nodes are not included in the LLM's causal order, query GPT-4 using pairwise CoT prompt to finalize the direction.
      Score-Based Methods: Provide the level order of the causal graph returned by LLM as a prior for a score-based algorithm like CaMML. Optionally, provide prior probability to control the influence of prior on the algorithm.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the accuracy of the inferred causal order using the Dtop metric and compare it with existing discovery algorithms.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of LLM-augmented methods with baseline discovery algorithms in terms of Dtop and effect estimation error (ϵACE).

- Evaluates the proposed method on a diverse set of benchmarks, covering arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding, and code generation
- Compares the performance of SEC against zero-shot learning and ICL with human-crafted demonstrations

Strengths of Paper 2:
- Tackles the core challenge of determining reliable causal graphs from observational data
- Leverages LLMs to obtain the causal order of variables, which is easier to elicit from domain experts compared to complete graph structures
- Proposes different prompting strategies, including pairwise and triplet-based prompts, to query LLMs for causal order
- Integrates LLMs with established causal discovery algorithms to enhance their performance
- Evaluates the proposed method on benchmark datasets from the Bayesian network repository and compares the performance with baseline discovery algorithms

Weaknesses of Paper 1:
- The effectiveness of SEC may depend on the quality of the self-generated demonstrations, which could vary depending on the LLM and the task at hand
- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the quality of the self-generated demonstrations compared to human-crafted ones

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The accuracy of the inferred causal order relies heavily on the performance of the LLMs used
- The paper does not discuss the computational cost and scalability of the proposed method for larger datasets or more complex causal graphs

Conclusion:
While both papers make significant contributions to their respective fields, Paper 1 appears to have a more substantial impact on the broader AI community. The proposed SEC method addresses a fundamental limitation of ICL and has the potential to simplify and streamline the process of in-context learning for LLMs. The extensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks and the comparison with existing methods further strengthen the paper's contributions. In contrast, Paper 2, although novel and relevant to the causal inference community, has a more limited scope and potential impact on the wider AI field.

Beyond Stationarity: Convergence Analysis of Stochastic Softmax Policy Gradient Methods:
  Title: Beyond Stationarity: Convergence Analysis of Stochastic Softmax Policy Gradient Methods
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of optimizing policies in finite-time horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Unlike infinite horizon MDPs where optimal policies are stationary, finite-time MDPs require non-stationary policies that must be learned for each epoch. This problem is crucial for applications such as optimal stopping, supply chain management, and training large language models.
  Motivation: Existing methods often train all parameters simultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic programming. This approach can lead to suboptimal convergence rates. The paper introduces a new method called dynamic policy gradient, which trains parameters backwards in time, better exploiting the structure of finite-time problems and improving convergence bounds.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, dynamic policy gradient, combines dynamic programming and policy gradient techniques. It trains parameters backwards in time, treating the MDP as a nested sequence of contextual bandits. The method is analyzed for tabular softmax parametrization, both in exact and sampled gradient settings without regularization. The dynamic policy gradient method shows improved convergence bounds compared to simultaneous training.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Create a synthetic dataset for a finite-time MDP problem, such as a dice-throwing game with a finite horizon. The state space includes all possible states of the dice and a terminal state. The action space includes 'stop' and 'continue' actions.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: Use a tabular softmax parametrization for the policy. The policy in each epoch depends on a separate parameter vector. The total parameter tensor is divided into epoch-specific vectors.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: For the simultaneous approach, train all parameters at once to maximize the state value function at time 0. For the dynamic approach, train parameters sequentially starting from the last epoch, using the dynamic programming structure.
    Step 4: Training Procedure: For the simultaneous approach, use gradient ascent with a fixed step size to update all parameters simultaneously. For the dynamic approach, use gradient ascent to train each parameter vector sequentially, starting from the last epoch and moving backwards.
    Step 5: Evaluate Convergence: Evaluate the convergence of both methods by comparing the state value functions at time 0. Use the exact gradient for initial experiments, and then introduce stochastic gradients to simulate a model-free setting.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the convergence rates and final state value functions of the simultaneous and dynamic approaches. Analyze the impact of the dynamic approach on the convergence bounds and the efficiency of training.

Data De-Duplication and Semantic Enhancement for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training:
  Title: Data De-Duplication and Semantic Enhancement for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training
  Problem Statement: Vision-language pre-training models like CLIP have shown great promise in learning transferable representations from large-scale web data. However, the web data used for training these models are often noisy, with significant scene redundancy and misalignment in image-text pairs, leading to increased training expenses and computing resources.
  Motivation: Existing methods like CLIP require large amounts of data, which are often noisy and redundant, making the training process expensive and resource-intensive. The proposed method aims to address these issues by introducing a novel training strategy that reduces data redundancy and enhances semantic alignment between images and texts. This approach is expected to improve training efficiency and model performance by leveraging data de-duplication and semantic enhancement techniques.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, DS-CLIP, consists of two main components: Data De-Duplication (D3) and Semantic Enhancement (SE). D3 reduces training costs by uniformly sampling a portion of image-text pairs from pre-clustered data prototypes, ensuring data diversity. SE uses a large language model (LLM) and a visual large language model (VLLM) to refine and augment text captions, creating a one-to-multiple mapping between images and texts. Additionally, the method employs a Diverse Captions Training Mechanism (DCTM) and a Modality Self-enhancement Training Mechanism (MSTM) for effective training.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use publicly available datasets such as YFCC15M and Laion400M for pre-training. Evaluate the model on various downstream tasks including image classification (ImageNet, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, etc.), image-text retrieval (COCO, Flickr30K), object detection (COCO), and segmentation (ADE20K).
    Step 2: Model Architecture: The model consists of a dual-encoder architecture with a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the image encoder and a Transformer-based text encoder. The image encoder is initialized with ViT-B/32, ViT-B/16, or ViT-L/14, and the text encoder is a BERT-base model.
    Step 3: Data De-Duplication (D3): 1. Randomly select some images and feed them into an unsupervised visual encoder (e.g., DINO) to extract visual features. 2. Use K-Means clustering to group the images into K categories. 3. Uniformly sample a certain percentage of data points from each pre-clustered center during each training epoch to ensure data diversity and reduce redundancy.
    Step 4: Semantic Enhancement (SE): 1. Use LLaMA to refine the text captions, ensuring grammatical correctness and semantic richness. 2. Use LLaVA to generate text descriptions from images, addressing the issue of image-text misalignment. 3. Combine the refined and generated texts to create a one-to-multiple mapping between images and texts.
    Step 5: Diverse Captions Training Mechanism (DCTM): 1. For each image, use multiple corresponding texts (original, LLaMA-refined, and LLaVA-generated) to form a one-to-multiple mapping. 2. Employ text-to-image contrastive loss and image-to-text multi-positive contrastive loss to align image and text embeddings.
    Step 6: Modality Self-enhancement Training Mechanism (MSTM): 1. Augment images through transformations (e.g., adding noise, random cropping). 2. Use self-supervised loss for images and multi-positive self-supervised loss for texts to enhance uni-modal representation learning.
    Step 7: Training Settings: Train the model on the YFCC15M dataset with ViT-B/32 and ViT-B/16, and on the Laion400M dataset with ViT-L/14. Use a batch size of B and a learning rate of LR. Train for a specified number of epochs, sampling 50% of the data during each epoch.
    Step 8: Get Results: Evaluate the model on zero-shot and linear probe image classification tasks, image-text retrieval, object detection, and segmentation. Use metrics like Top-1 accuracy, mAP, mIoU, and R@K to measure performance.
    Step 9: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of DS-CLIP with baseline methods like CLIP, SLIP, MS-CLIP, DeCLIP, and LaCLIP. Analyze improvements in training efficiency, data diversity, and model performance across various tasks.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in their respective domains. The first paper, "Beyond Stationarity: Convergence Analysis of Stochastic Softmax Policy Gradient Methods," focuses on improving the optimization of policies in finite-time horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The authors propose a novel method called dynamic policy gradient, which trains parameters backwards in time, exploiting the structure of finite-time problems and improving convergence bounds compared to simultaneous training. The paper provides a well-structured experiment plan, including the creation of a synthetic dataset, model architecture, training objectives, and evaluation of convergence rates.

The second paper, "Data De-Duplication and Semantic Enhancement for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training," addresses the issue of noisy and redundant data in vision-language pre-training models like CLIP. The authors propose a novel training strategy called DS-CLIP, which consists of two main components: Data De-Duplication (D3) and Semantic Enhancement (SE). D3 reduces training costs by uniformly sampling a portion of image-text pairs from pre-clustered data prototypes, while SE uses large language models to refine and augment text captions, creating a one-to-multiple mapping between images and texts. The paper also introduces two training mechanisms, Diverse Captions Training Mechanism (DCTM) and Modality Self-enhancement Training Mechanism (MSTM), for effective training.

While both papers make significant contributions to their respective fields, the second paper, "Data De-Duplication and Semantic Enhancement for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training," appears to be more impactful and likely to be accepted at a top AI conference. The paper addresses a pressing issue in the rapidly growing field of vision-language pre-training, which has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed method, DS-CLIP, offers a novel and comprehensive approach to tackle the challenges of data redundancy and semantic misalignment, which are common in large-scale web data used for training these models. The authors provide a detailed and well-structured experiment plan, covering various datasets, model architectures, and evaluation metrics across multiple downstream tasks. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods like CLIP, SLIP, and LaCLIP further strengthens the paper's contribution.

In contrast, while the first paper makes a valuable contribution to the optimization of policies in finite-time horizon MDPs, the impact and applicability of the proposed method may be more limited compared to the second paper. The focus on a specific problem setting and the use of a synthetic dataset for experiments may not demonstrate the full potential of the dynamic policy gradient method in real-world scenarios.

paper 1:
KNIFE: Distilling Reasoning Knowledge From Free-Text Rationales:
  Title: KNIFE: Distilling Reasoning Knowledge From Free-Text Rationales
  Problem Statement: Language models (LMs) have shown impressive results on many language reasoning tasks, but they still make unexpected errors, raising doubts about their reasoning abilities. The problem is how to improve the reasoning capabilities of small-scale LMs (i.e., <1B parameters) using free-text rationales (FTRs) without requiring prohibitively large models or failing to improve performance through existing finetuning methods.
  Motivation: Existing finetuning methods fail to improve LM performance, and prompting methods require prohibitively large LMs (i.e., >50B parameters) to work well. The inspiration behind the proposed method, KNIFE, is to effectively distill reasoning knowledge from FTRs into a small LM, thereby improving its performance. The proposed method is expected to work better than existing baselines because it leverages a teacher-student framework to transfer reasoning knowledge from FTRs to the LM's hidden states, allowing the student LM to perform inference without direct FTR input.
  Proposed Method: KNIFE involves a two-step process: 1) Finetuning a teacher LM with both task input and FTR to predict the task output, thereby transferring reasoning knowledge from the FTRs to the teacher's hidden states. 2) Finetuning a student LM with only the task input, aligning its hidden states with the teacher's hidden states. This endows the student with reasoning knowledge, enabling it to perform inference without direct FTR input. The method uses knowledge distillation (KD) to transfer the reasoning knowledge from the teacher to the student.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate on two question-answering benchmarks: OpenBookQA (OBQA) and StrategyQA. OBQA is a four-choice QA dataset simulating science exams, while StrategyQA is a boolean QA dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning.
    Step 2: Select Models: We use T5-Base and T5-Large as the backbone models for KNIFE and all baselines. For KD-based methods, we consider T5-Base → T5-Base, T5-Large → T5-Large, and T5-Large → T5-Base configurations.
    Step 3: Train Teacher Model: Finetune the teacher LM to predict the task output, taking as input the concatenation of task input and the FTR. This process aggregates reasoning knowledge across all finetuning instances' FTRs and stores it in the teacher's hidden states. The teacher LM has a bottleneck design where the encoder hidden states upon the FTR tokens are masked out in the cross-attention.
    Step 4: Train Student Model: Finetune the student LM with only the task input, aligning its hidden states with the teacher's hidden states. The student is trained using KD losses: LKD-In for encoder hidden states and LKD-Out for decoder hidden states. The total loss is L = λKD-In LKD-In + λKD-Out LKD-Out.
    Step 5: Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the performance of the student LM on the test sets of OBQA and StrategyQA. Compare the results with various baselines, including standard finetuning, finetuned self-rationalization, input augmentation, prompted self-rationalization, pipeline rationalization, and FT Teacher Init.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Analyze the results to determine if KNIFE outperforms the baselines in both fully-supervised and low-resource settings. Conduct ablation studies to validate the design choices of KNIFE, such as the impact of KD objectives, FTR usage, FTR perturbation, teacher bottleneck, and student task loss. Additionally, analyze failure modes on other datasets like ECQA and QuaRTz to identify the importance of FTR quality.

Overthinking the Truth:
  Title: Overthinking the Truth: Understanding how Language Models Process False Demonstrations
  Problem Statement: Modern language models can imitate complex patterns through few-shot learning, enabling them to complete challenging tasks without fine-tuning. However, this imitation can lead models to reproduce inaccuracies or harmful content if present in the context. The paper aims to understand how language models process false demonstrations and identify the internal mechanisms that lead to harmful imitation.
  Motivation: Existing methods do not adequately address the issue of harmful imitation in language models. While models often perform well zero-shot, they can still produce incorrect or harmful outputs when given misleading few-shot demonstrations. The inspiration behind the new method is to study the internal representations of models to identify specific components that cause harmful imitation. The proposed method aims to work better by focusing on intermediate model computations to understand and mitigate harmful behaviors.
  Proposed Method: The paper proposes to study harmful imitation through the lens of a model’s internal representations, identifying two phenomena: overthinking and false induction heads. Overthinking occurs when the model's accuracy decreases after a certain 'critical layer' when given incorrect demonstrations. False induction heads are attention heads in late layers that attend to and copy false information from previous demonstrations. The method involves decoding predictions from intermediate layers and ablating specific attention heads to reduce overthinking.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The study uses fourteen text classification datasets: SST-2, Poem Sentiment, Financial Phrasebank, Ethos, TweetEval-Hate, TweetEval-Atheism, TweetEval-Feminist, Medical Questions Pairs, MRPC, SICK, RTE, AGNews, TREC, and DBpedia. Additionally, a toy dataset called Unnatural is used.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For each dataset, prompts are constructed with either correct or incorrect labels for few-shot classification. Incorrect labels are generated using a cyclic permutation of the classes.
    Step 3: Select Models: The study evaluates 8 pretrained autoregressive language models: GPT-J-6B, GPT2-XL-1.5B, GPT-NeoX-20B, Pythia models (410M, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B), and Llama2-7B. Instruction-tuned versions of GPT-2-XL, GPT-J-6B, and GPT-NeoX-20B are also evaluated.
    Step 4: Decode Intermediate Predictions: Use the logit lens method to decode next-token probabilities from intermediate layers of the models. Measure the calibrated accuracy of these intermediate predictions across all datasets.
    Step 5: Identify Critical Layers: Analyze the layerwise accuracy to identify 'critical layers' where the accuracy given correct and incorrect demonstrations diverges sharply.
    Step 6: Ablate Attention Heads: Identify and ablate specific attention heads in the later layers that are responsible for harmful imitation. Measure the impact of these ablations on the model's performance.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the full model, the model with late layers zeroed out, and the model with specific attention heads ablated. Evaluate the reduction in the accuracy gap between correct and incorrect demonstrations and the impact on performance given correct demonstrations.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Strengths of KNIFE:
1. Addresses the important problem of improving reasoning capabilities in small-scale language models.
2. Proposes a novel method to distill reasoning knowledge from free-text rationales into the model's hidden states.
3. Uses a teacher-student framework to enable the student model to perform inference without direct access to rationales.
4. Provides a clear step-by-step experiment plan to evaluate the method on two question-answering benchmarks.
5. Plans to conduct ablation studies to validate the design choices and analyze failure modes.

Weaknesses of KNIFE:
1. Relies on the availability and quality of free-text rationales, which may not always be present or of high quality.
2. May not generalize well to other types of reasoning tasks beyond question-answering.

Strengths of Overthinking the Truth:
1. Addresses the important issue of harmful imitation in language models when given misleading few-shot demonstrations.
2. Proposes to study the internal representations of models to identify specific components that cause harmful imitation.
3. Introduces the concepts of overthinking and false induction heads to explain the phenomenon of harmful imitation.
4. Provides a clear step-by-step experiment plan to evaluate the method on a diverse set of text classification datasets.
5. Plans to analyze the impact of ablating specific attention heads on reducing harmful imitation.

Weaknesses of Overthinking the Truth:
1. Focuses primarily on text classification tasks and may not generalize well to other types of language tasks.
2. Does not propose a concrete solution to mitigate harmful imitation beyond ablating attention heads.

Comparison:
Both papers address important problems in language models and propose novel methods to tackle them. KNIFE focuses on improving reasoning capabilities in small-scale models, while Overthinking the Truth focuses on understanding and mitigating harmful imitation. KNIFE's strength lies in its novel approach to distilling reasoning knowledge from rationales, while Overthinking the Truth's strength lies in its analysis of internal model representations to identify the causes of harmful imitation.

However, KNIFE's method is more concrete and provides a clear path to improving model performance on reasoning tasks. In contrast, Overthinking the Truth's method is more exploratory and does not propose a definitive solution to mitigate harmful imitation. Additionally, KNIFE's focus on question-answering tasks is more specific and potentially more impactful than Overthinking the Truth's focus on text classification.

Therefore, based on the strengths and weaknesses of both papers, KNIFE appears to be the more promising and potentially accepted idea.

Phenomenal Yet Puzzling:
  Title: Phenomenal Yet Puzzling: Testing Inductive Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models with Hypothesis Refinement
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of evaluating and improving the inductive reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs). Inductive reasoning, the ability to derive underlying principles from a handful of observations and generalize to novel situations, is central to human intelligence. Despite their success on various benchmarks, LMs often fall short in this area.
  Motivation: Existing methods typically use standard input-output prompting, which does not closely mirror the human inductive process. These methods often fail to capture the iterative nature of human reasoning, where hypotheses are proposed, tested, and refined. The proposed method, iterative hypothesis refinement, aims to better emulate this human process. By generating, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules, the method leverages the strengths of LMs as hypothesis proposers while addressing their weaknesses in rule application.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, iterative hypothesis refinement, involves a three-step process: 1) Hypotheses Generation: LMs generate a set of candidate rules based on observations. 2) Hypotheses Selection: A symbolic interpreter evaluates these rules and selects the best one based on accuracy over seen examples. 3) Hypotheses Refinement: The selected rule is refined iteratively by the LM, using feedback from the symbolic interpreter. This process is repeated until the rule achieves strong performance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The study evaluates the method on four distinct tasks: ACRE (Abstract Causal Reasoning), MiniSCAN (language-like compositional instructions), List Functions (symbolic operations), and MiniARC (visual concepts).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts:
      Hypothesis Generation: Generate a rule that maps the following inputs to their corresponding outputs. {Task description} {Examples} Please format your rule as follows: {Rule format}
      Hypothesis Refinement: Your rule: {Rule} This rule does not work for the following examples. {Feedback} Generate a new rule that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. {Feedback description} Please format your rule as follows: {Rule format}
      Hypothesis Translation: You are an expert Python programmer. Write a Python function ‘fn‘ for the following rule. {Translation Example description} Rule: {Rule}
      Rule Application: Generate an output corresponding to the given input based on the rule. {Application Example description} Rule: {Rule} Input: {Test input} Output:
    Step 3: Select Models: The primary model used for experiments is GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613). Additional results are provided for GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613), Claude-2, and LLaMA2-70B.
    Step 4: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of the models on the datasets using both the baseline (standard input-output prompting) and the proposed method (iterative hypothesis refinement).
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the models using raw accuracy and task accuracy metrics. Analyze the discrepancies between rule induction and rule application, and evaluate the robustness of the models to noisy and unfamiliar examples. Conduct human studies to compare LM-induced rules with human-induced rules.

NL2ProGPT:
  Title: NL2ProGPT: Taming Large Language Model for Conversational Protein Design
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the challenge of generating macromolecular protein sequences using Large Language Models (LLMs) in a way that bridges the gap between natural language and protein language. This problem is interesting and important because it leverages the vast amount of human-curated protein knowledge in text form to advance protein design, which has significant implications for biomedical research and applications.
  Motivation: Existing methods for protein sequence generation primarily focus on either sequential or structural information of proteins, lacking the ability to generate proteins in a controlled, conversational manner. These methods do not effectively utilize the wealth of textual descriptions available for proteins. The proposed method, NL2ProGPT, aims to overcome these limitations by integrating protein functions, properties, and structural information into a coherent framework that allows for precise and controlled protein design. The method is expected to outperform existing baselines by ensuring high consistency in text-to-protein generation and effective exploration of disordered regions.
  Proposed Method: NL2ProGPT is a framework that fine-tunes LLMs for protein sequence generation by incorporating textual and structural information. The method involves three key steps: (1) Synthesizing protein functions and properties into specific text guidelines for controlled protein design. (2) Enhancing protein descriptions by clustering embeddings from pre-trained protein language models to inject structural information. (3) Training a reward model to align the protein language model with the Rosetta energy function using Reinforced Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). This approach ensures that the generated protein sequences are both structurally sound and consistent with the provided textual descriptions.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Randomly select over 1 million proteins from the Pfam dataset as the training dataset. Use the standard 25 amino acid names in IUPAC for vocabulary representation.
    Step 2: Data Construction: For each protein sequence, perform multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) using InterProScan to capture functional information and domain characteristics. Extract embedded features using pre-trained protein representation models (e.g., ESM-2 and OntoProtein) and reduce dimensionality using UMAP. Cluster the reduced features using K-means to obtain cluster representations. Construct text templates embedding these representations and generate diverse protein text descriptions using ChatGPT.
    Step 3: Self-supervised Fine-tuning: Combine the textual description with the amino acid sequence into a sequence x = [w:a] and model its probability distribution P(x) using a neural network. Fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-2 model to learn the conditional distributions between amino acid sequences and protein descriptions. Use cross-entropy loss for guidance during fine-tuning.
    Step 4: Reinforced Learning from AI Feedback: Define a reward function considering generality (using Rosetta energy function) and consistency (using cluster representation scores). Fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize the expected reward. Balance the contributions of each reward score using hyperparameters.
    Step 5: Protein Generation Application: Use the fine-tuned model to generate protein sequences given target structures. Inject the target protein structural embedding into the protein description to produce self-consistent sequences. Evaluate the generated sequences for structural similarity and consistency with natural proteins.
    Step 6: Get Results: Generate 1000 protein sequences using the model and predict their structures using ESMFold. Calculate Rosetta scores, pLDDT scores, and self-consistent perplexities to evaluate the quality and reliability of the generated sequences.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of NL2ProGPT with existing methods (e.g., ProGen-2, ESM-2MR, ProtGPT2) in terms of Rosetta scores, pLDDT scores, and self-consistent perplexities. Evaluate the consistency of generated sequences with textual constraints and analyze the secondary structure distribution. Perform case studies to assess the biological interpretability of cluster representations and the model's ability to explore disordered regions.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important problems in their respective domains and propose novel methods to tackle them. However, there are notable differences in the clarity, novelty, and potential impact of the two ideas.

Paper 1, "Phenomenal Yet Puzzling," focuses on evaluating and improving the inductive reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs). The proposed method, iterative hypothesis refinement, aims to better emulate the human reasoning process by generating, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. The paper provides a clear problem statement, motivation, and a well-structured experiment plan. The method leverages the strengths of LMs while addressing their weaknesses, making it a promising approach to enhance the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs. The evaluation on diverse datasets and the comparison with baseline methods demonstrate the thoroughness of the study.

Paper 2, "NL2ProGPT," addresses the challenge of generating macromolecular protein sequences using LLMs by integrating textual and structural information. The proposed method aims to bridge the gap between natural language and protein language, enabling controlled and conversational protein design. While the problem statement and motivation are well-articulated, the experiment plan lacks some clarity and specificity compared to Paper 1. The method's novelty lies in its integration of protein functions, properties, and structural information, but the potential impact and superiority over existing methods are not as strongly demonstrated as in Paper 1.

Considering the clarity of the problem statement, the novelty of the proposed method, the thoroughness of the experiment plan, and the potential impact on the respective fields, Paper 1 appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance. The iterative hypothesis refinement method presents a more innovative and well-defined approach to address the limitations of current methods in evaluating and improving the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs. In contrast, while Paper 2 tackles an important problem, the proposed method's novelty and potential impact are not as clearly demonstrated, and the experiment plan could benefit from more specificity.

paper 1:
In-Context Pretraining:
  Title: In-Context Pretraining: Language Modeling Beyond Document Boundaries
  Problem Statement: Current language models (LMs) are trained to predict tokens given document prefixes, which limits their ability to reason across document boundaries. This limitation affects their performance on tasks requiring complex contextual reasoning.
  Motivation: Existing pretraining pipelines concatenate random sets of shorter documents to create longer context windows, but the prior documents provide no signal for predicting the next document. This results in inefficiencies and limits the model's ability to understand and reason across document boundaries. The proposed method, IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, aims to address this by training LMs on sequences of related documents, thereby enhancing their ability to read and reason across document boundaries.
  Proposed Method: IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING involves reordering the pretraining data so that each context contains related documents. This is achieved by using approximate algorithms for finding related documents with efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent input contexts with a graph traversal algorithm. The method involves two main steps: (1) finding related documents at scale using a retrieval model, and (2) creating input contexts by traversing a document graph to concatenate related documents into coherent sequences.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use the English CommonCrawl dataset, sampling 235 million documents amounting to 306 billion tokens.
    Step 2: Construct Document Graph: Use the contriever model to map each document to an embedding and retrieve the top-k most similar documents using approximate nearest neighbor search with the FAISS library. Construct a document graph where each document is a node and edges represent semantic similarity.
    Step 3: Create Input Contexts: Formulate the document sorting as a maximum traveling salesman problem. Use a greedy algorithm to traverse the document graph, ensuring each document is included only once, and concatenate documents into fixed-sized input contexts (e.g., 8192 tokens).
    Step 4: Pretrain Models: Adopt the model architecture and pretraining objective of LLaMA. Pretrain models of various sizes (0.3B, 0.7B, 1.5B, and 7.0B parameters) using the constructed input contexts. Use the AdamW optimizer and a cosine learning rate schedule. Employ flash attention to reduce memory consumption.
    Step 5: Evaluate Language Modeling: Evaluate the language modeling perplexity on Wikipedia, Arxiv, and Books corpora. Compare the performance of IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING with standard and kNN baselines.
    Step 6: Evaluate In-Context Learning: Use seven text classification datasets (SST-2, Amazon, Yelp, AGN, Dbpedia, Hate, Offensive) to evaluate in-context learning with 32 demonstration examples. Report accuracy as the metric.
    Step 7: Evaluate Reading Comprehension: Evaluate on RACE (High and Middle), SQuAD, BoolQ, DROP, and HotpotQA using 2-shot in-context learning. Report exact match scores for HotpotQA and SQuAD, and accuracy for other datasets.
    Step 8: Evaluate Retrieval-Augmentation: Conduct evaluations on Natural Questions (NQ) and TriviaQA in both closed-book and open-book settings. Report exact match scores.
    Step 9: Evaluate Factuality: Evaluate on NQ-Swap and MemoTrap datasets to assess the model's ability to generate outputs faithful to prior contexts. Report exact match scores.
    Step 10: Evaluate Long Context Reasoning: Evaluate on the SCROLL benchmark (NarrativeQA, Qasper, ContractNLI, QMSum, GovReport) to assess long context reasoning. Report F1 scores for NarrativeQA, Qasper, and ContractNLI, and ROUGE-1 scores for QMSum and GovReport.
    Step 11: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING with standard and kNN baselines across all tasks. Analyze the impact of document relevance and deduplication on model performance. Monitor training loss and downstream task performance throughout the pretraining process.

AntifakePrompt:
  Title: AntifakePrompt: Prompt-Tuned Vision-Language Models are Fake Image Detectors
  Problem Statement: Deep generative models can create remarkably photorealistic fake images, raising concerns about misinformation and copyright infringement, known as deepfake threats. The challenge is to develop a deepfake detection technique that can generalize well against emerging and more advanced generative models.
  Motivation: Existing methods typically learn classifiers in the image domain or various feature domains, but they struggle with generalizability against new and advanced generative models. Inspired by the zero-shot advantages of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the proposed method leverages VLMs and prompt tuning techniques to improve deepfake detection accuracy over unseen data. The hypothesis is that VLMs, with their strong generality and zero-shot capabilities, can capture more general instruction-aware features from images, enhancing the transferability of the deepfake detector.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method formulates deepfake detection as a visual question answering (VQA) problem. It uses VLMs like InstructBLIP and tunes soft prompts to answer whether a query image is real or fake. Specifically, a 'pseudo-word' is inserted into the prompt, and the corresponding word embedding is optimized to correctly answer 'Yes' or 'No' for real and fake images, respectively. This approach significantly reduces training costs and improves performance on both held-in and held-out testing datasets from a full spectrum of generative models.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Use Microsoft COCO (MS COCO) and Flickr30k datasets. Select 90K images from MS COCO for training and 3K images from Flickr30k for held-out testing.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: Formulate the deepfake detection task as a VQA problem with the prompt 'Is this photo real?' and append a pseudo-word to the end of the prompt, resulting in 'Is this photo real S*?'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use InstructBLIP as the VLM. Initialize the model from the instruction-tuned checkpoint provided by LA VIS and only fine-tune the word embedding of the pseudo-word while keeping all other parts of the model frozen.
    Step 4: Train the Model: Train the model with a maximum of 10 epochs using AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9 and β2=0.999, batch size 6, and a weight decay of 0.05. The learning rate is initially set to 10^-8 and decays with a cosine schedule. Use 4 NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs for training.
    Step 5: Generate Fake Images: Generate fake images using various generative models: SD2, SDXL, DeepFloyd IF, DALLE-2, SGXL, GLIDE, ControlNet, LaMa, LTE, SD2 inpainting model, and SD2 super resolution model. Also, include images from face swapping datasets (Deeperforensics, DFDC, FaceForensics++) and images generated under adversarial, backdoor, and data poisoning attacks.
    Step 6: Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model on datasets from 3 held-in and 16 held-out generative models, covering modern text-to-image generation, image editing, and adversarial image attacks. Measure the deepfake detection accuracy and compare it with baseline methods.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method with baseline methods like Wang-2020, DE-FAKE, DIRE, LASTED, J. Ricker 2022, QAD, InstructBLIP without prompt tuning, and InstructBLIP with LoRA tuning. Analyze the generalizability and robustness of the model against unseen generative models and attack scenarios.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- The proposed method relies on the performance of the underlying vision-language model (InstructBLIP)
- The effectiveness of the prompt tuning approach may depend on the choice of the pseudo-word and the prompt formulation

Comparison and Decision:
Both papers make significant contributions to their respective fields. However, Paper 1 stands out due to its novel approach to addressing a fundamental limitation of current language models. The proposed IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING method has the potential to improve the performance of language models on a wide range of tasks that require complex contextual reasoning. Moreover, the comprehensive evaluation plan and the comparison with standard and kNN baselines demonstrate the thoroughness of the research.

In contrast, while Paper 2 addresses an important problem, the proposed method relies heavily on the performance of the underlying vision-language model and may be sensitive to the choice of prompt formulation. Additionally, the societal impact of the research in Paper 1 is likely to be more significant, as improved language models can benefit a wide range of applications in natural language processing.

Therefore, based on the strengths and potential impact of the research, Paper 1 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

Aligner: One Global Token is Worth Millions of Parameters When Aligning LLMs:
  Title: Aligner: One Global Token is Worth Millions of Parameters When Aligning LLMs
  Problem Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) require frequent alignment to new behaviors or value systems, but fine-tuning the entire model is often impractical due to the massive number of parameters involved. The challenge is to develop a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that can achieve comparable performance to full fine-tuning while using significantly fewer parameters.
  Motivation: Existing PEFT methods like LoRA and LLaMA-Adapters can achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning but still require millions of parameters. These methods often involve layer-specific modifications, which may not be the most efficient way to achieve form alignment. The inspiration behind Aligner is to explore whether a globally shared set of tunable tokens can achieve the same or better performance with a fraction of the parameters. The proposed method leverages the idea that 'form' should have a global influence over 'ability,' and thus a global component within the Transformer architecture could be more efficient.
  Proposed Method: Aligner introduces a globally shared set of tunable tokens that modify the attention of every layer in the LLM. This method employs a single token accounting for about 5,000 parameters, which is significantly fewer than the millions required by methods like LoRA. The globally shared tokens are attended to by each layer, and their influence is modulated by a gating factor. This design allows the Aligner to affect the LLM globally, making it highly parameter-efficient.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We use the Alpaca dataset for instruction following and the PKU-Beaver dataset for value alignment tasks. For reasoning tasks, we use the MMLU benchmark and the MetaMath dataset for training, and the GSM8K benchmark for evaluation.
    Step 2: Model Selection: We use LLaMA2 7B and 13B as the base models for all experiments. We compare Aligner with state-of-the-art PEFT methods like LoRA and LLaMA-Adapter.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: For instruction following, we perform supervised fine-tuning to minimize the next-token prediction loss. For value alignment, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the model with human values. For reasoning tasks, we fine-tune the models on the MetaMath dataset.
    Step 4: Construct Prompts: For instruction following, we prompt the model to generate responses to various instructions. For value alignment, we prompt the model to respond to safety-related queries. For reasoning tasks, we prompt the model with math problems and multiple-choice questions.
    Step 5: Get Results: Evaluate the models on the Vicuna benchmark for instruction following, the PKU-Beaver Safety Benchmark for value alignment, and the MMLU and GSM8K benchmarks for reasoning tasks.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of Aligner with LoRA and LLaMA-Adapter in terms of parameter efficiency and task performance. Analyze the quality of responses and the insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs provided by Aligner.

Activation Patching in Language Models:
  Title: Towards Best Practices of Activation Patching in Language Models: Metrics and Methods
  Problem Statement: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the internal mechanisms of machine learning models, with localization—identifying the important model components—being a key step. Activation patching, also known as causal tracing or interchange intervention, is a standard technique for this task. However, the literature contains many variants with little consensus on the choice of hyperparameters or methodology. This paper systematically examines the impact of methodological details in activation patching, including evaluation metrics and corruption methods, to provide recommendations for best practices.
  Motivation: Existing methods for activation patching vary significantly in their choice of hyperparameters and methodologies, leading to disparate interpretability results. This lack of standardization raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of prior interpretability findings. The paper aims to systematically study these variations to understand their impact and provide empirical and conceptual arguments for why certain metrics or methods may be preferred. The proposed recommendations are expected to lead to more reliable and consistent interpretability results.
  Proposed Method: The paper systematically examines three degrees of freedom in activation patching: (1) Corruption methods, specifically Gaussian noising (GN) and Symmetric token replacement (STR); (2) Evaluation metrics, comparing probability, logit difference, and KL divergence; (3) Sliding window patching, which jointly restores the activations of multiple MLP layers. The study involves empirical experiments on several interpretability tasks, including factual recall and circuit discovery in language models, to assess the impact of these hyperparameters.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For factual recall, use the PAIRED FACTS dataset, which consists of 145 pairs of prompts with the same sequence length but distinct answers. For IOI circuit discovery, use the pIOI distribution to sample clean prompts.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For factual recall, create clean and corrupted prompts. For example, 'The Eiffel Tower is in' (clean) and 'The Colosseum is in' (corrupted). For IOI, use sentences like 'When John and Mary went to the office, John gave a book to Mary.' and corrupt the S2 token.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT-2 XL for factual recall experiments and GPT-2 small for IOI circuit discovery.
    Step 4: Apply Corruption Methods: For GN, add Gaussian noise to the token embeddings of key tokens. For STR, replace key tokens with semantically related ones.
    Step 5: Perform Activation Patching: Run three model passes: (1) Clean run with clean prompt and cache activations; (2) Corrupted run with corrupted prompt; (3) Patched run with corrupted prompt but replace specific activations with cached clean activations.
    Step 6: Evaluate Patching Effects: Compare the model performance between the corrupted and patched runs using different metrics: probability, logit difference, and KL divergence.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Examine the impact of different corruption methods and evaluation metrics on interpretability tasks. For example, assess how GN and STR affect the localization of factual recall in GPT-2 XL and the discovery of the IOI circuit in GPT-2 small.
    Step 8: Provide Recommendations: Based on empirical observations, provide recommendations for best practices in activation patching. Advocate for STR as the preferred corruption method and logit difference as the evaluation metric.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important topics in the field of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. The first paper, "Aligner: One Global Token is Worth Millions of Parameters When Aligning LLMs," proposes a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that aims to achieve comparable performance to full fine-tuning while using significantly fewer parameters. The motivation behind this work is clear, and the proposed method of using globally shared tunable tokens to modify the attention of every layer in the LLM is innovative and well-explained. The step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive and covers a range of tasks, including instruction following, value alignment, and reasoning. The comparison with state-of-the-art PEFT methods like LoRA and LLaMA-Adapter strengthens the paper's contribution.

The second paper, "Towards Best Practices of Activation Patching in Language Models: Metrics and Methods," focuses on the important task of mechanistic interpretability in language models. The paper aims to systematically examine the impact of methodological details in activation patching, including evaluation metrics and corruption methods, to provide recommendations for best practices. The motivation for this work is well-justified, given the lack of standardization in existing methods and the potential impact on the reliability and consistency of interpretability results. The proposed systematic study of corruption methods, evaluation metrics, and sliding window patching is thorough and well-designed. The step-by-step experiment plan is detailed and covers relevant interpretability tasks, such as factual recall and circuit discovery.

While both papers make valuable contributions, the first paper, "Aligner," stands out as the more impactful and innovative work. The proposed PEFT method has the potential to significantly reduce the computational cost and environmental impact of aligning LLMs to new behaviors or value systems. The globally shared tunable tokens approach is a novel and efficient way to achieve form alignment, and the extensive experiments on a range of tasks demonstrate its effectiveness. In contrast, the second paper, while important for establishing best practices in activation patching, is more focused on refining existing methods rather than proposing a groundbreaking new approach.

In conclusion, both papers are well-written and address important topics in the field. However, the first paper, "Aligner," is likely to have a more significant impact on the research community and is more suitable for acceptance at a top AI conference like ICLR or ACL.

Headless Language Models:
  Title: Headless Language Models: Learning without Predicting with Contrastive Weight Tying
  Problem Statement: Self-supervised pre-training of language models typically involves predicting probability distributions over large token vocabularies, which can be computationally expensive and inefficient. This paper addresses the problem of reducing the computational requirements of training language models while improving their performance on downstream tasks.
  Motivation: Existing methods for language model pre-training rely on predicting token probabilities, which necessitates a language modeling projection head. This approach requires significant memory and computational resources, especially as the token vocabulary size increases. The proposed method, Contrastive Weight Tying (CWT), aims to eliminate the need for probability prediction by focusing on reconstructing input embeddings in a contrastive manner. This shift is inspired by the weight-tying trick and is expected to reduce computational costs and improve data efficiency and downstream performance.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method, Contrastive Weight Tying (CWT), involves pre-training language models by reconstructing input embeddings contrastively rather than predicting token probabilities. The key steps are: 1) Masking or altering input sequences, 2) Using the model's own input embeddings as static target representations, 3) Applying a contrastive loss that maximizes the scalar product between input embeddings and output representations, and 4) Using in-batch negative examples to regularize the contrastive objective. This method is applied to both encoder and decoder models in monolingual and multilingual contexts.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For monolingual encoders, use the OpenWebText2 dataset. For monolingual decoders, use the same dataset.

Positional Description Matters for Transformers Arithmetic:
  Title: Positional Description Matters for Transformers Arithmetic
  Problem Statement: Transformers, despite their success in Natural Language Processing (NLP), struggle with arithmetic tasks, especially with larger numbers. This is due to their naive reliance on positional information, which leads to poor performance on arithmetic problems involving a large number of digits.
  Motivation: Existing methods fail to address the core issue of positional encoding in transformers, which causes them to perform poorly on arithmetic tasks with larger numbers. The inspiration behind the proposed method is to modify the positional encoding or the representation of arithmetic tasks to better leverage standard positional encoding. The proposed method aims to improve the performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks by addressing the limitations of positional encoding.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves two main approaches: (1) Directly modifying the positional encoding, such as using randomized embedding, and (2) Modifying the representation of arithmetic tasks to leverage standard positional encoding differently. These modifications are tested on three tasks: classical multiplication, length extrapolation in addition, and addition in a natural language context.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: For classical multiplication, create a dataset with 300k samples of 1-to-n-digit multiplication. For addition tasks, create a dataset with 120k samples of 2-to-10-digit addition. For natural language addition, generate dialogue data using GPT-3.5 and arithmetic data programmatically.
    Step 2: Construct Data Formats:
      Classical Multiplication:
        Basic: Present the multiplier, multiplicand, and their product straightforwardly.
        Add Padding: Pad numbers with zeros to ensure all numbers have the same length.
        Reverse Product: Reverse the digits in the product.
        Add Padding + Reverse Product: Combine padding and reversing the product.
      Addition Tasks:
        Basic: Write down the two addends followed by the digit-wise summation steps and the final sum.
        Random Space: Introduce random spaces between characters in the data.
        Recursive Scratchpad: Increase information repetition for each digit-wise step.
      Natural Language Addition:
        Dialogue Data: Generate dialogues where a student asks a teacher to add two numbers.
        Addition Data - Basic: Present the addition problem and its solution straightforwardly.
        Addition Data - Random Space: Introduce random spaces between characters in the addition data.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use GPT2-small (124M parameters) for all tasks. Train models with and without positional embedding, and with random embedding.
    Step 4: Train Models:
      Classical Multiplication: Train models on datasets with different data formats for 300 epochs with a learning rate of 2e-5.
      Addition Tasks: Fine-tune pretrained GPT2-small for five epochs with a learning rate of 2e-5.
      Natural Language Addition: Train models on dialogue data and mixed data (dialogue + addition) for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 2e-5.
    Step 5: Get Results:
      Classical Multiplication: Evaluate models on 100 samples for each combination of digit lengths.
      Addition Tasks: Evaluate models on 100 samples for each number of digits (9-13 digits).
      Natural Language Addition: Evaluate models on 100 samples for each number of digits (2-5 digits) in both dialogue and pure arithmetic contexts.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of models with different data formats and positional encoding modifications. Analyze the impact of data format and positional encoding on the generalization capacity and accuracy of the models.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and propose novel methods to tackle these issues. However, there are notable differences in the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the two ideas.

Paper 1, "Headless Language Models," presents a novel approach to pre-training language models by eliminating the need for predicting token probabilities. The proposed Contrastive Weight Tying (CWT) method aims to reduce computational costs and improve data efficiency while maintaining or enhancing downstream performance. The motivation behind this work is well-justified, as the current approach to language model pre-training is computationally expensive and resource-intensive. The proposed method is clearly explained, and the step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured, covering monolingual and multilingual contexts for both encoder and decoder models. The evaluation metrics and datasets chosen are appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

On the other hand, Paper 2, "Positional Description Matters for Transformers Arithmetic," focuses on a more specific problem: the poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks involving larger numbers. While the problem statement is clear, the motivation and novelty of the proposed method are less compelling compared to Paper 1. The proposed modifications to positional encoding and the representation of arithmetic tasks are interesting but lack the same level of potential impact as the CWT method in Paper 1. The experiment plan is well-designed, covering various tasks and data formats, but the scope of the work is narrower compared to Paper 1.

Considering the novelty, potential impact, and broader applicability of the proposed methods, Paper 1 appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference. The CWT method has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and performance of language model pre-training, which is a fundamental aspect of NLP research. In contrast, while Paper 2 addresses an important issue, its impact is more limited to the specific domain of arithmetic tasks.

In conclusion, based on the meta-review, Paper 1 demonstrates greater novelty, broader potential impact, and a more compelling motivation compared to Paper 2. Therefore, Paper 1 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

Fine-tuning Multimodal LLMs to Follow Zero-shot Demonstrative Instructions:
  Title: Fine-tuning Multimodal LLMs to Follow Zero-shot Demonstrative Instructions
  Problem Statement: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to comprehend demonstrative instructions that consist of multiple, interleaved, and multimodal instructions. This is due to the inherent bias in Visual Prompt Generators (VPGs) which focus primarily on the main visual content necessary for caption generation, often neglecting other crucial visual details.
  Motivation: Existing methods train VPGs on millions of image-caption pairs, which biases them to concentrate on primary visual contents sufficient for caption generation, neglecting other visual details. This results in MLLMs underperforming in tasks requiring comprehension of demonstrative instructions. The proposed method introduces a Visual Prompt Generator Complete module (VPG-C) to infer and complete missing details essential for understanding demonstrative instructions. The synthetic discriminative training strategy fine-tunes VPG-C without the need for supervised demonstrative instructions, making it more effective than existing baselines.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves a lightweight Visual Prompt Generator Complete module (VPG-C) that infers and completes missing visual details. VPG-C first derives instruction-specific guidance by intercepting the intermediate LLM’s output of the primary contents extracted by a conventional VPG. It then guides the VPG to recover the missing visual residual details, which are reintegrated into the intermediate LLM’s layer via a skip connection. A synthetic discriminative training strategy is used to fine-tune VPG-C, eliminating the need for supervised demonstrative instructions.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: The evaluation is conducted on the DEMON benchmark, which includes 31 diverse tasks across 7 categories. Further evaluation is done on the MME and OwlEval benchmarks.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, the model generates responses directly from the given instructions. For the proposed method, the VPG-C module first generates instruction-specific guidance and then extracts missing visual details. These details are reintegrated into the LLM’s intermediate layer to generate the final response.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used include Vicuna-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and Vicuna-13B. The visual encoder is ViT-G/14 from EV A-CLIP, and the visual prompt generator is the Q-Former from BLIP-2.
    Step 4: Get Results: Obtain predictions from the models on the DEMON, MME, and OwlEval benchmarks using both the baseline and the proposed method.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of the proposed method against existing MLLMs. Metrics include zero-shot performance on the DEMON benchmark, and evaluation scores on the MME and OwlEval benchmarks. Analyze the effectiveness of VPG-C in improving comprehension of demonstrative instructions.

When does In-context Learning Fall Short and Why? A Study on Specification-Heavy Tasks:
  Title: When does In-context Learning Fall Short and Why? A Study on Specification-Heavy Tasks
  Problem Statement: In-context learning (ICL) has become the default method for using large language models (LLMs). However, ICL falls short of handling specification-heavy tasks, which are tasks with complicated and extensive task specifications requiring several hours for ordinary humans to master, such as traditional information extraction tasks. The performance of ICL on these tasks mostly cannot reach half of the state-of-the-art results.
  Motivation: Existing methods like ICL are not good enough to solve specification-heavy tasks due to three primary reasons: inability to specifically understand context, misalignment in task schema comprehension with humans, and inadequate long-text understanding ability. The proposed method of fine-tuning LLMs can achieve decent performance on these tasks, indicating that the failure of ICL is not an inherent flaw of LLMs but rather a drawback of existing alignment methods. This suggests that better alignment methods could enable LLMs to handle more sophisticated human demands.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves fine-tuning LLMs on specification-heavy tasks to achieve better performance. Additionally, dedicated instruction tuning is performed to align LLMs with human expectations for these tasks. This involves manually curating instructions and diversifying them through augmentation techniques. The fine-tuning and instruction tuning processes help LLMs better understand and handle the complex specifications of these tasks.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect 18 specification-heavy tasks across 6 different types from conventional natural language understanding tasks, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), Event Detection (ED), Event Argument Extraction (EAE), Event Relation Extraction (ERE), and Sentiment Classification (SC).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For the pilot experiments, use human-written instructions and 8-shot demonstrations (2-shot for DocRED and MA VEN-ERE due to limited input length, and 10-shot for FewRel 2.0). For the instruction tuning, manually curate 10 instructions per task and diversify the set through augmentation techniques such as random shuffling of the predefined task schema.
    Step 3: Select Models: Investigate several competitive LLMs, including FLAN-UL2, Alpaca, Vicuna, GPT-3.5 Turbo (ChatGPT), text-davinci-003 (Davinci), and GPT-4. For fine-tuning experiments, use FLAN-UL2 and the FLAN-T5 model family (from SMALL to XXL).
    Step 4: Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune FLAN-UL2 and FLAN-T5 models on each of the investigated specification-heavy tasks. Convert all datasets into text-generation format and use the same input-output format as in the pilot experiments, excluding instructions and demonstrations. Use appropriate hyper-parameters for fine-tuning, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
    Step 5: Instruction Tuning: Perform instruction tuning on FLAN-UL2 using the mixed datasets sampled from original training sets. Use examples-proportional mixing method with a mixing rate of 3k. Instruction-tune FLAN-UL2 with 32k gradient steps using AdamW optimizer, a batch size of 32, and a learning rate of 1.0×10−3. The maximum input and output sequence lengths are all 512.
    Step 6: Get Results: Evaluate the performance of LLMs on the test sets of the investigated tasks using F1 scores calculated via string matching with ground-truth annotations. Compare the performance of fine-tuned models, instruction-tuned models, and the original ICL performance.
    Step 7: Analyze Results: Analyze the reasons behind the failure of ICL on specification-heavy tasks through error analyses and dedicated analytical experiments. Identify the main failure reasons: inability to specifically understand context, misalignment in task schema comprehension with humans, and inadequate long-text understanding ability. Compare the performance improvements achieved through fine-tuning and instruction tuning.


Now decide which one is the accepted idea. Think step by step by writing a meta-review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of both ideas and explain why one idea is better than the other. After the meta-review, start a new line and directly return a number 1 or 2 to indicate the accepted idea and end the response.

full response:  Meta-Review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus and approach.

Paper 1 tackles the problem of multimodal LLMs struggling to comprehend demonstrative instructions consisting of multiple, interleaved, and multimodal instructions. The proposed Visual Prompt Generator Complete (VPG-C) module aims to infer and complete missing visual details essential for understanding demonstrative instructions. The synthetic discriminative training strategy eliminates the need for supervised demonstrative instructions, making it more effective than existing baselines. The evaluation plan is comprehensive, covering diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Paper 2 investigates the limitations of in-context learning (ICL) in handling specification-heavy tasks. The authors identify three primary reasons for ICL's shortcomings: inability to specifically understand context, misalignment in task schema comprehension with humans, and inadequate long-text understanding ability. The proposed method involves fine-tuning LLMs and performing dedicated instruction tuning to align LLMs with human expectations. The experiment plan is well-structured, covering a wide range of specification-heavy tasks and comparing the performance of various LLMs.

While both papers contribute to advancing the field, Paper 2 has a slight edge due to its more comprehensive analysis of the limitations of ICL and its potential impact on a broader range of tasks. The study provides valuable insights into the reasons behind ICL's failure and proposes a promising approach to address these issues through fine-tuning and instruction tuning. The extensive evaluation plan, covering 18 specification-heavy tasks across 6 different types, strengthens the paper's findings and conclusions.

In contrast, Paper 1 focuses on a more specific problem of demonstrative instructions in multimodal LLMs. Although the proposed VPG-C module is innovative and the evaluation plan is solid, the scope of the paper is relatively narrower compared to Paper 2.

Language Model Agents Suffer from Compositional Decision Making:
  Title: Language Model Agents Suffer from Compositional Decision Making
  Problem Statement: Language model agents (LMAs) have shown promise in multi-step decision-making tasks, often outperforming humans and other reinforcement learning agents. However, their performance on real-world applications that involve combinations of tasks remains underexplored. This paper addresses the challenge of compositional decision-making in LMAs, particularly in web automation tasks.
  Motivation: While existing LMAs perform well on base tasks, their performance significantly degrades on compositional tasks. This indicates a gap in their ability to generalize to more complex, real-world scenarios that require combining multiple tasks. The proposed method aims to bridge this gap by introducing a new benchmark and training strategies that improve the generalization capabilities of LMAs.
  Proposed Method: The paper introduces CompWoB, a benchmark consisting of 50 new compositional web automation tasks. It evaluates the performance of existing prompted LMAs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4) and transferred LMAs (finetuned only on base tasks). Additionally, a new model, HTML-T5++, is trained by balancing data distribution across tasks. This model surpasses human-level performance on MiniWoB and achieves the best zero-shot performance on CompWoB.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets from MiniWoB and CompWoB. MiniWoB includes 65 base tasks, while CompWoB consists of 50 compositional tasks created by combining base tasks.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For prompted LMAs, use few-shot exemplars for base tasks. For compositional tasks, test different prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot with first-task exemplars, second-task exemplars, and combination exemplars.
    Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate the following models: gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, HTML-T5, HTML-T5++, RCI, AdaPlanner, and Synapse. HTML-T5++ is trained with a rebalanced dataset to improve performance.
    Step 4: Get Results: Run 100 episodes per task for each model on both MiniWoB and CompWoB. Measure the success rate for each task and analyze the performance degradation from base tasks to compositional tasks.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of prompted and transferred LMAs. Identify the factors that contribute to the performance degradation, such as instruction length and HTML complexity. Evaluate the robustness of LMAs to different instruction compositions and the impact of using advanced LLMs like gpt-4.

Humans vs ChatGPT: Uncovering the Non-trivial Distinctions by Evaluating Parallel Responses:
  Title: Humans vs ChatGPT: Uncovering the Non-trivial Distinctions by Evaluating Parallel Responses
  Problem Statement: The advent of ChatGPT and similar Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the generation of human-like natural language text. This raises the question of whether human-generated text and ChatGPT-generated text are truly indistinguishable. The study aims to identify and analyze the differences between human-generated content and text generated by ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Davinci-3.
  Motivation: Existing methods have shown that it is possible to differentiate between human and ChatGPT-generated text using machine learning techniques. However, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the non-trivial distinctions between the two. The study leverages Roget's thesaurus and various machine learning models to uncover thematic, contextual, and lexicographic differences. The proposed method aims to provide a more comprehensive analysis of these differences, which could lead to better classification models.
  Proposed Method: The study compares human-generated content to ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Davinci-3 using the same technical questions from StackOverflow and general questions from Yahoo Answers. Roget's thesaurus is used to uncover thematic similarities and differences. A chi-square test is performed on Roget's 1034 categories to identify significant differences in word appearance. The MIT Embedding Comparator is used to distinguish GloVe base vectors trained on human and ChatGPT corpora. Pre-trained BERT and Sentence-BERT models are used to measure semantic similarity. Various machine learning models are then employed to classify the text based on the identified differences.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: A novel dataset is constructed with 13,496 data points. 6250 are human-generated content from StackOverflow, Yahoo Answers, and YouTube. 6144 data points are from GPT models answering the same questions or producing content for the same title. 1106 data points are of ChatGPT being told to pretend to be a user of StackOverflow or a YouTuber when generating content.
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For ChatGPT-3, the 'prompts' created from the questions from StackOverflow and Yahoo Answers are fed into a new instance of chat. For contextual answers, the prompt is modified by adding a phrase before the question. For ChatGPT-4, the prompt asks it to write a YouTube script with the title.
    Step 3: Select Models: The models used are ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Davinci-3. Pre-trained BERT and Sentence-BERT models are also used for semantic similarity analysis.
    Step 4: Perform POS Tagging, Stop Word Analysis, and BLEU Score Calculation: Analyze the Parts-Of-Speech (POS) distribution, stop word usage, and BLEU scores between human-generated text and ChatGPT-generated text. Compare the most frequently occurring POS tags and calculate BLEU scores from BLEU-1 to BLEU-4.
    Step 5: Map to Roget's Thesaurus: Map the words in the text to corresponding categories in Roget's thesaurus. Calculate the chi-square score and p-value for each category to identify significant differences.
    Step 6: Compare Word Neighborhoods: Use GloVe to map words into a high-dimensional space and cluster them. Use the MIT Embedding Comparator to perform a global comparison of embedding spaces and analyze local neighborhoods.
    Step 7: High-Level Textual Comparison Using BERT Models: Propagate the data through pre-trained BERT and Sentence-BERT models. Calculate the cosine similarity between human-text and GPT-text embeddings. Visualize the embeddings using T-SNE plots and stacked histograms.
    Step 8: Model with Machine Learning and Baseline BERT: Clean the data and encode it using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer. Train various classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, XGB) on a binary classification task. Perform feature reduction on linear SVM. Use baseline BERT for comparison.

Weaknesses of Paper 2:
- Focuses primarily on text classification rather than providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of language generation in LLMs
- Does not propose a novel method or model for improving the performance of LLMs or the classification of human vs. ChatGPT-generated text

Comparison and Decision:
Both papers address important problems in the field of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. However, Paper 1 stands out for its novelty in addressing the challenge of compositional decision-making in LMAs. The introduction of a new benchmark and the proposed HTML-T5++ model demonstrate a significant contribution to the field. Additionally, the detailed experiment plan and the focus on real-world applications make Paper 1 more impactful.

In contrast, while Paper 2 provides a comprehensive analysis of the differences between human and ChatGPT-generated text, it lacks the novelty and potential impact of Paper 1. The focus on text classification, rather than proposing new methods or models, limits its contribution to the advancement of LLMs.

Therefore, based on the strengths and potential impact, Paper 1 is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference.

paper 1:
Neural Language of Thought Models:
  Title: Neural Language of Thought Models
  Problem Statement: The Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) suggests that human cognition operates on a structured, language-like system of mental representations. While neural language models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently and explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from non-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge.
  Motivation: Existing neural language models benefit from the compositional and symbolic structure in language data but struggle to learn such structured representations from non-linguistic data like images. This is significant because humans, including infants, can learn these structures from observing objects and events before acquiring language skills. Current models like VQ-VAE and its variants fail to capture the holistic structure and semantics of scenes, often representing them as grids of small patches. This limitation hinders their ability to perform tasks requiring relational reasoning and out-of-distribution generalization.
  Proposed Method: The Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM) is introduced for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and generation. NLoTM consists of two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (SVQ-VAE), which learns hierarchical, composable discrete representations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT Prior (ALP), an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens compositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. SVQ-VAE achieves discrete semantic decomposition of a scene by learning hierarchical, composable factors that align with objects and their properties. ALP generates a representation of a scene one object at a time, based on their properties.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: We evaluate NLoTM on two variants of a 2D Sprites dataset and three variants of the CLEVR dataset (CLEVR-Easy, CLEVR-Hard, CLEVR-Tex). The 2D Sprites datasets contain objects of varying shapes and colors, while the CLEVR datasets contain objects with varying shapes, colors, positions, sizes, and materials.
    Step 2: Model Architecture: For SVQ-VAE, we use a slot attention encoder to obtain object-centric representations, which are then split into blocks representing different factors. Each block is quantized using a corresponding codebook. The decoder reconstructs the image using an autoregressive transformer decoder. For ALP, we use a simple autoregressive transformer decoder to model the distribution of the discrete tokens generated by SVQ-VAE.
    Step 3: Training Objectives: Train SVQ-VAE with a reconstruction loss, a VQ-VAE commitment loss, and EMA updates on the codebooks. Train ALP to model the distribution of the discrete tokens generated by SVQ-VAE.
    Step 4: Baseline Comparisons: Compare NLoTM with VQ-VAE (with a PixelCNN prior), dVAE (with a transformer decoder prior), and GENESIS-v2 (a continuous latent object-centric model with an autoregressive prior).
    Step 5: Metrics and Evaluation: Evaluate the models on image generation quality using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and generation accuracy. For downstream tasks, evaluate on an odd-one-out task and a property comparison task to assess the models' ability to generalize to out-of-distribution tasks.
    Step 6: Analyze Results: Compare the performance of NLoTM with the baselines in terms of FID, generation accuracy, and downstream task performance. Analyze the learned codebooks to understand the semantic representations captured by NLoTM.

Taming AI Bots: Controllability of Neural States in Large Language Models:
  Title: Taming AI Bots: Controllability of Neural States in Large Language Models
  Problem Statement: The paper addresses the problem of whether an agent can control an AI bot to any state by suitable choice of prompts. Specifically, it investigates the controllability of large language models (LLMs) in producing sequences or sentences that convey certain meanings, rather than just individual words.
  Motivation: Existing methods view LLMs as discrete-time dynamical systems that are trivially controllable in the embedding space of word tokens. However, these methods do not address the control of sequences that convey specific meanings. The proposed method aims to fill this gap by defining meanings as equivalence classes of complete trajectories of tokens and framing the problem as determining the controllability of a dynamical system evolving in the quotient space of discrete trajectories induced by the model itself. This approach is novel and has not been tackled before.
  Proposed Method: The proposed method involves characterizing a 'well-trained LLM' through conditions largely met by today's LLMs and showing that, when restricted to the space of meanings, a well-trained AI bot is controllable under verifiable conditions. The method includes a functional characterization of AI bots and derives necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability. The approach leverages the LLM's ability to map incomplete sequences of tokens to an inner product space of discriminant vectors and complete sequences to a vector space, aligning them with human supervision during fine-tuning.
  Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
    Step 1: Gather Datasets: Collect datasets that include both pre-training data (e.g., large text corpora from the internet) and fine-tuning data with human annotations (e.g., datasets with labeled sentences for toxicity, helpfulness, etc.).
    Step 2: Construct Prompts: For baseline, prompt the model to generate sequences directly. For the proposed method, prompt the model to generate sequences and then use the same model to evaluate the meaning of the generated sequences. Example prompts include: 'Generate a sentence that conveys the meaning of [input context]' and 'Evaluate the meaning of the following sentence: [generated sentence]'.
    Step 3: Select Models: Use state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2-70B-chat. Ensure that the models are both pre-trained and fine-tuned with human annotations.
    Step 4: Get Results: Generate sequences using the models and evaluate their meanings using the same models. Record the sequences and their evaluated meanings.
    Step 5: Analyze Results: Compare the controllability of the models by analyzing whether the generated sequences align with the intended meanings. Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling the AI bot to produce desired meanings. Metrics to be used include the accuracy of meaning alignment, the diversity of generated sequences, and the robustness of the model against adversarial prompts.

full response:  Meta-review:

Both papers address important challenges in the field of natural language processing and large language models. However, they differ in their focus and approach.

Paper 1, "Neural Language of Thought Models," tackles the problem of learning structured, language-like representations from non-linguistic data, such as images. The motivation is clear and well-articulated, highlighting the limitations of current models in capturing the holistic structure and semantics of scenes. The proposed method, NLoTM, introduces novel components like SVQ-VAE and ALP to learn hierarchical, composable discrete representations aligned with objects and their properties. The step-by-step experiment plan is detailed and includes appropriate datasets, model architecture, training objectives, baseline comparisons, and evaluation metrics.

Paper 2, "Taming AI Bots: Controllability of Neural States in Large Language Models," addresses the problem of controlling AI bots to produce sequences or sentences that convey specific meanings. While the motivation is interesting, the problem statement and proposed method are less clear and lack the same level of detail as Paper 1. The functional characterization of AI bots and the conditions for controllability are not fully explained. The experiment plan is also less comprehensive, lacking specific details on datasets, model architecture, and evaluation metrics.

Comparing the two papers, Paper 1 has several strengths:
1. A well-defined problem statement and clear motivation
2. A novel and detailed proposed method (NLoTM) with specific components (SVQ-VAE and ALP)
3. A comprehensive experiment plan with appropriate datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics
4. Potential for significant impact in learning structured representations from non-linguistic data

In contrast, Paper 2 has some weaknesses:
1. A less clear problem statement and motivation
2. A proposed method that lacks sufficient detail and explanation
3. An experiment plan that is less comprehensive and lacks specific details
4. Limited potential for impact compared to Paper 1

Based on this analysis, Paper 1 appears to be the stronger submission and is more likely to be accepted by a top AI conference like ICLR or ACL.
