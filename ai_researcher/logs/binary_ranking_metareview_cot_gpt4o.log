#### LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models

**Novelty:**
LongLoRA introduces two key innovations: Shifted Sparse Attention (S2-Attn) and an improved version of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA+). These innovations are designed to address the computational inefficiencies and limitations of existing methods for extending the context length of large language models (LLMs). The combination of these techniques is novel and has the potential to significantly reduce the computational cost associated with long-context LLMs.

**Soundness:**
The proposed method is well-grounded in existing research and builds upon established techniques like LoRA and sparse attention mechanisms. The step-by-step experiment plan is detailed and methodologically sound, covering dataset selection, model selection, training procedures, and evaluation metrics. The use of specific datasets and evaluation metrics like perplexity and retrieval-based evaluations ensures that the results will be robust and meaningful.

**Potential Impact:**
If successful, LongLoRA could make long-context LLMs more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources. This would have a significant impact on various applications that require long-context understanding, such as document summarization and long-form question answering. The compatibility with existing techniques like Flash-Attention2 further enhances its practical applicability.

#### Large Language Models as Superpositions of Cultural Perspectives

**Novelty:**
The idea of viewing LLMs as superpositions of cultural perspectives rather than stable entities is a fresh and thought-provoking perspective. The concept of 'unexpected perspective shift effect' and 'perspective controllability' introduces new dimensions to the study of LLMs, challenging the conventional methods of evaluating their behavior and values.

**Soundness:**
The proposed method is well-structured and involves a systematic approach to studying the context-dependency of LLMs. The use of established psychology questionnaires and statistical tests like ANOVA and posthoc Tukey HSD adds rigor to the study. However, the reliance on psychological tools designed for humans to measure LLM behavior may raise questions about the validity of the results.

**Potential Impact:**
This research could significantly alter how we understand and evaluate LLMs, particularly in terms of their ethical and societal implications. By highlighting the context-dependency of LLMs, it could lead to more nuanced and accurate methods for studying and deploying these models. However, the practical applications of this research are less immediately clear compared to LongLoRA.

**Soundness:**
The methodology is sound, with a clear experiment plan involving a multi-agent Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task. The use of hand-annotated metrics and user studies to evaluate the generated explanations adds rigor to the evaluation process. However, the lack of specificity regarding the LLM used (implied to be GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) is a minor drawback.

**Potential Impact:**
The ability to generate natural language explanations for agent behavior can significantly enhance human-agent interaction, especially in safety-critical settings. The proposal's focus on producing plausible explanations with minimal hallucination and allowing for user interaction is highly relevant and impactful.

The method of systematically masking each word and evaluating its impact is inspired by permutation importance, which is a novel application in the context of LLMs.

**Soundness:**
The methodology is sound and well-explained, with a clear step-by-step experiment plan. The use of different text scores to measure word importance and the introduction of suffixes to discern their effect on the output are well-thought-out. However, the proposal lacks some details on how the results will be validated and compared with existing methods.

**Potential Impact:**
The proposed method has the potential to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs, which is crucial for their ethical use and reliability. However, the impact might be limited to specific applications where understanding word importance is critical. The proposal does not provide a comprehensive evaluation plan on multiple datasets, which somewhat limits its potential impact.

#### Proposal 2: LLM Censorship: The Problem and its Limitations

**Novelty:** This proposal tackles the important issue of censorship in LLMs, framing it as a security problem rather than a purely machine learning challenge. The introduction of 'Mosaic Prompts' as an attack method is a novel concept that highlights the limitations of current censorship approaches.

**Soundness:** The methodology is sound but less detailed compared to Proposal 1. While the step-by-step experiment plan is clear, the proposal lacks specific details on how the security-based censorship mechanisms will be developed and integrated. The concept of 'Mosaic Prompts' is intriguing but requires more elaboration to fully understand its implications and effectiveness.

**Potential Impact:** Addressing the censorship problem from a security perspective is a valuable contribution, especially given the increasing concerns about the misuse of LLMs. However, the impact is somewhat limited by the lack of detailed implementation strategies and the potential challenges in integrating security-based defenses into existing LLM frameworks.

### Conclusion

#### Proposal 2: An Axiomatic Approach to Model-Agnostic Concept Explanations

**Novelty:**
The proposal aims to develop a model-agnostic approach to concept explanations that satisfies three natural axioms: linearity, recursivity, and similarity. While the axiomatic approach is interesting, the concept of model-agnostic explanations is not entirely new. The novelty here is more about the formalization and integration of existing ideas rather than introducing a fundamentally new concept.

**Soundness:**
The methodology is sound and well-detailed, with a clear step-by-step experimental plan. The use of different models and datasets, along with the implementation of new measures, provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the proposed approach. However, the reliance on axioms may limit the flexibility of the method in practical applications.

**Potential Impact:**
The potential impact is somewhat limited compared to the first proposal. While the method could improve the interpretability of machine learning models, the practical benefits may be constrained by the need for human-labeled concept vectors and the specific nature of the axioms. The proposal does not address scalability or applicability to a wide range of models and datasets as effectively as the first proposal.

### Conclusion

While both proposals are well-crafted and address important issues in their respective domains, Proposal 1 stands out due to its higher novelty, soundness, and potential impact. The introduction of Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD) offers a new approach to mitigating the train-inference distribution mismatch, which is a critical problem in knowledge distillation for language models.
