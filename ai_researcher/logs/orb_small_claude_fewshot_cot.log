Here are the key reasons:

Novelty and Originality:
Paper 1 introduces a novel trigger called VSSC-trigger that is designed to be visible, semantic, sample-specific, and compatible. This is a new approach compared to existing methods that focus on invisible triggers. The use of large language models for trigger selection and advanced image editing techniques for generating poisoned images is also an innovative aspect.

In contrast, paper 2 primarily provides a theoretical analysis of why prefixLM performs better than causalLM for in-context learning. While the insights are valuable, the overall novelty seems lower compared to paper 1.

Soundness and Methodology:
Paper 1 presents a well-structured experiment plan that covers various aspects such as dataset selection, model choice, poisoned dataset generation, robustness testing against visual distortions, and out-of-distribution generalization. The step-by-step methodology demonstrates the soundness of the approach.

Paper 2 also has a solid methodology with theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. However, the focus is more on understanding the behavior of existing models rather than proposing a significantly new method.

Potential Impact:
Paper 1 addresses the practical challenge of making backdoor attacks more robust against visual distortions, which is a critical issue for real-world applications. The proposed VSSC-trigger has the potential to advance the field of adversarial machine learning and improve the understanding of backdoor attacks.

Paper 2 provides valuable insights into the convergence behavior of prefixLM and causalLM, which can guide the design of more effective transformer models for in-context learning. However, the immediate practical impact may be less significant compared to paper 1.

In summary, while both papers have their strengths, paper 1 stands out in terms of novelty, soundness, and potential impact. The introduction of the VSSC-trigger and the comprehensive experiment plan make it a stronger candidate for acceptance in a top AI conference.

predicted:  After carefully analyzing both papers, I believe that paper 2 (SmoothLLM) is more likely to be the accepted idea between the two. Here are the key factors that led to this conclusion:

Novelty:
- Paper 1 (Masked Structural Growth) proposes a novel progressive learning framework for language model pre-training, which is an interesting approach. However, the idea of progressive growth in neural networks is not entirely new and has been explored in previous works.
- Paper 2 (SmoothLLM) introduces a novel defense mechanism against jailbreaking attacks on LLMs, which is a highly relevant and pressing issue in the current landscape of AI safety. The approach of perturbing prompts and aggregating outputs to detect adversarial inputs is a fresh perspective on this problem.

Soundness:
- Paper 1's methodology seems sound, with well-defined growth schedules and function-preserving growth operators. The experimental plan is comprehensive, covering both Bert and GPT models, and includes fine-tuning on various downstream tasks.
- Paper 2's methodology is also sound, leveraging the brittleness of adversarial prompts to character-level changes. The proposed perturbation and aggregation steps are well-defined, and the experimental plan covers a wide range of LLMs and evaluation metrics, including attack success rate and nominal performance.

Potential Impact:
- Paper 1's impact lies in accelerating language model pre-training, which can benefit the research community by reducing computational costs and carbon footprints. However, the 2x speedup mentioned in the title may not be a groundbreaking improvement.
- Paper 2's impact is significant, as it addresses the critical issue of jailbreaking attacks on LLMs, which can have severe consequences in various applications. The proposed defense mechanism, SmoothLLM, has the potential to greatly enhance the safety and reliability of LLMs, making it a highly impactful contribution.

Considering these factors, paper 2 (SmoothLLM) stands out as the more likely accepted idea due to its novelty in addressing a critical issue, soundness in methodology, and significant potential impact on the safety and reliability of LLMs.

Novelty:
- Text2Reward proposes a novel approach to automate the generation and shaping of dense reward functions using large language models (LLMs) based on natural language goals. This is a significant advancement compared to existing methods that require specialized knowledge, domain data, or human effort.
- Fusion Token, while enhancing the efficiency of language model tokenization, is an incremental improvement over the well-established Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) method.

Soundness:
- Text2Reward's methodology is well-structured and grounded in a compact representation of the environment. The three-stage approach (Expert Abstraction, User Instruction, and User Feedback) provides a solid foundation for generating interpretable and flexible reward functions.
- Fusion Token's methodology is sound but lacks the same level of innovation as Text2Reward. The proposed algorithm for grouping n-grams is a straightforward extension of the BPE approach.

Potential Impact:
- Text2Reward has the potential to significantly reduce the development costs and effort required for designing reward functions in reinforcement learning. By automating this process using LLMs, it can make RL more accessible and applicable to a wider range of tasks and domains.
- Fusion Token's impact is limited to improving the efficiency of language model tokenization. While this is important for optimizing computational resources, it does not have the same broad impact as Text2Reward in terms of enabling new applications or reducing development costs.

Considering these factors, Text2Reward stands out as the more innovative, impactful, and likely to be accepted idea compared to Fusion Token.

0.300585
predicted:  Based on the provided information, I believe paper 1 (LLM-Prop) is more likely to be the accepted idea compared to paper 2 (Rethinking Model Ensemble in Transfer-based Adversarial Attacks). Here are the key reasons:

Novelty:
- LLM-Prop tackles the understudied problem of predicting crystal properties from text descriptions, which offers a new perspective compared to traditional graph neural network (GNN) based methods.
- While paper 2 proposes improvements to model ensemble methods for adversarial attacks, the overall approach of using model ensembles is not entirely novel.

Soundness:
- LLM-Prop leverages the strong language understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to capture rich information from crystal text descriptions. The proposed method of finetuning the T5 encoder for regression and classification tasks is well-justified and grounded in the strengths of LLMs.
- Paper 2's proposed method, Common Weakness Attack (CWA), is based on promoting flatness of the loss landscape and closeness to local optima. While these properties are relevant to adversarial transferability, the connection may not be as direct or well-established compared to LLM-Prop's use of LLMs for text understanding.

Potential Impact:
- LLM-Prop has the potential to significantly improve the prediction of crystal properties, which is crucial for crystal design and discovery. The ability to leverage text descriptions can enable more efficient and accurate property prediction compared to GNN-based methods.
- While paper 2's proposed method aims to improve adversarial transferability, the overall impact on the field of adversarial attacks may be more incremental compared to LLM-Prop's potential to advance crystal property prediction.

Considering these factors, LLM-Prop (paper 1) appears to be the more promising and impactful idea, with a higher likelihood of being accepted compared to paper 2.

paper 1 meta review:
 This paper proposes OctoPack, a new approach for instruction tuning code large language models using a large dataset of Git commits called CommitPack. The authors create a new benchmark HumanEvalPack to evaluate code LLMs on code repair, explanation and synthesis tasks across 6 programming languages. Using CommitPack for instruction tuning, they train OctoCoder and OctoGeeX models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among permissively licensed models on HumanEvalPack.

The paper addresses an important problem of improving code LLMs using instruction tuning in a permissive setting, without relying on closed-source APIs. The proposed CommitPack dataset and HumanEvalPack benchmark are valuable contributions that can enable further research in this area. The OctoCoder and OctoGeeX models demonstrate strong performance gains from the proposed instruction tuning approach.

Some weaknesses are that the paper lacks ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components like the dataset size, filtering, mixing ratios etc. More analysis is needed on where the performance gains are coming from. The comparison with non-permissive models like GPT-4 is also not entirely fair.
Justification for why not higher score: While the results are strong, some more analysis and ablation studies would have made the contributions clearer and more impactful. The comparison with non-permissive models is also a bit misplaced.
Justification for why not lower score: The paper makes several valuable contributions including the new dataset, benchmark and instruction-tuned models that advance the state-of-the-art among permissively licensed code LLMs. The results are convincing and can enable further research.

paper 1 score:  7.0



paper 2 meta review:
 This paper proposes a novel approach for making statistical models more explainable and steerable by representing model parameters as natural language strings. Instead of opaque numerical parameters, the models use interpretable natural language predicates that can be steered using language-based constraints. The key technical insight is to interpret these predicates as binary feature extractors over input data using the denotational semantics of language. The learning algorithm involves a continuous relaxation of the discrete predicates which allows optimization via gradient descent, interleaved with a discretization step that generates new predicates from an LLM.

The proposed idea is highly original and could significantly improve the interpretability and controllability of statistical models. Using language as an interface between humans and models is an elegant solution. The technical approach is sound and the continuous relaxation enables efficient optimization. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a range of tasks like clustering, topic modeling and regression. 

One weakness is that the current discretization step using an LLM is a bit of a black box and more analysis is needed on what makes for good discrete predicates and how well this scales to more complex constraints and domains. The compute cost of iterative relaxation and discretization could also be a concern for large datasets.
Justification for why not higher score: While highly original, some of the components like LLM-based discretization need more analysis and robustness. Compute efficiency is also a potential concern.
Justification for why not lower score: The core idea is novel and impactful. The approach is technically sound and the results are promising. This work can spur significant follow-up research in interpretable and steerable ML.

paper 2 score:  8.0


accepted paper:  Based on the meta-reviews, paper 2 seems to be the stronger submission and more likely to be accepted. While both papers propose novel and valuable ideas, paper 2 stands out in terms of the originality and potential impact of using natural language as an interface for making statistical models more interpretable and steerable. The idea of representing model parameters as language predicates that can be optimized and steered using constraints is elegant and technically sound. 

In contrast, while paper 1 makes useful contributions in the form of the CommitPack dataset and HumanEvalPack benchmark for instruction tuning code LLMs, the gains from the proposed instruction tuning approach need more analysis and ablation studies to be fully convincing. The comparisons with non-permissive models are also not entirely appropriate.

So in terms of the novelty of the core idea, technical soundness, and broader impact on improving the interpretability and controllability of ML models, paper 2 appears to be the stronger contender and more likely to be accepted by the committee. The constructive feedback for paper 1 is to dig deeper into the results to clearly bring out the source of improvements and focus the comparisons on permissively licensed models.

0.35313
predicted:  After carefully analyzing both papers, I believe that paper 2, "PixArt-α: Fast Training of Diffusion Transformer for Photorealistic Text-to-Image Synthesis," is more likely to be the accepted paper. Here are the reasons:

1. Novelty: While both papers address important problems, PixArt-α introduces a novel approach to efficient training of text-to-image models. The decomposition of the training strategy, optimization of the Transformer architecture, and use of high-informative data are innovative techniques that set it apart from existing methods.

2. Soundness: The methodology proposed in PixArt-α is well-structured and grounded in solid principles. The three-stage training strategy, incorporation of cross-attention modules, and the use of high-information-density captions demonstrate a thoughtful approach to improving training efficiency while maintaining image quality.

3. Potential Impact: The problem addressed by PixArt-α has significant implications for the AIGC community. Reducing training costs and CO2 emissions while maintaining competitive image generation quality can make advanced text-to-image models more accessible to researchers and startups. This can foster innovation and democratize access to these powerful tools.

4. Evaluation: The evaluation plan for PixArt-α is comprehensive, using established metrics like FID and compositionality, as well as human-preference rates. The comparison with state-of-the-art models like DALL-E 2, SDv2, and SDXL provides a strong benchmark for assessing its performance.

While AutoDAN in paper 1 also tackles an important problem of adversarial attacks on LLMs, the potential impact and novelty of PixArt-α appear to be more significant. The focus on efficiency and accessibility in text-to-image synthesis has the potential to drive broader adoption and innovation in the field.

Novelty: 
Paper 1 proposes a neural sandbox framework to identify spurious concepts in LLM decisions, which is an interesting approach. However, the use of concept words and relevance scores is not entirely novel, as similar techniques have been explored in interpretable AI research.

In contrast, Paper 2 introduces a novel method, Raidar, that leverages the rewriting behavior of LLMs to detect AI-generated text. The insight that LLMs tend to make fewer modifications to AI-generated text is unique and forms the basis for a new detection approach.

Soundness:
Both papers present well-structured experiment plans, including dataset selection, prompt construction, model selection, and evaluation metrics. However, Paper 2 provides a more comprehensive evaluation plan, including robustness testing against adversarial rephrasing and different LLMs, which strengthens the soundness of the proposed method.

Paper 1's experiment plan includes foreign injection of cop-words and bias terminologies, but it lacks a clear explanation of how these tests contribute to the overall soundness of the method.

Potential Impact:
While both papers address important problems, the potential impact of Paper 2 is more significant. Detecting AI-generated text is a critical challenge with far-reaching implications in various domains, such as misinformation, phishing, and academic integrity. Raidar's compatibility with black-box LLMs and its robustness against adversarial attacks make it a promising solution for real-world applications.

Paper 1's neural sandbox framework aims to improve the interpretability of LLM decisions, which is valuable for understanding and mitigating biases. However, its impact may be more limited in scope compared to the broader applicability of Raidar.

In summary, while both papers present interesting ideas, Paper 2 (Raidar) stands out in terms of novelty, soundness, and potential impact. The unique approach of leveraging LLM rewriting behavior, the comprehensive evaluation plan, and the significant real-world implications make it a stronger candidate for acceptance.

predicted:  Based on the provided information, I believe paper 2 (Contrastive Preference Learning) is more likely to be the accepted idea between the two proposals. Here are the key factors that support this decision:

Novelty:
- Paper 2 introduces a novel approach, Contrastive Preference Learning (CPL), which directly learns optimal policies from human preferences without the need for reinforcement learning or learning reward functions.
- CPL leverages the regret-based model of human preferences, which is a recent development in the field and addresses the flawed assumptions of existing RLHF methods.

Soundness:
- The proposed CPL method is derived using the principle of maximum entropy and is based on a well-founded theoretical framework.
- CPL uses a simple contrastive objective and is fully off-policy, making it applicable to arbitrary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
- The experiments are well-designed, covering a range of tasks from the MetaWorld robotics benchmark and using both synthetic and real human preference datasets.

Potential Impact:
- CPL addresses the limitations of existing RLHF methods, such as high-variance policy gradients and instability in approximate dynamic programming, making it more scalable to high-dimensional and sequential problems.
- The method's simplicity and efficiency in learning directly from human preferences without the need for RL could have significant implications for aligning models with human intent in various domains.
- The applicability of CPL to real-world scenarios, as demonstrated by the experiments on D4RL real human preference datasets, highlights its potential for practical impact.

In contrast, while paper 1 (Language as Kernels) proposes an interesting approach to combine LLMs with kernel machines, it lacks the same level of novelty and potential impact as paper 2. The experiments are limited to the GLUE benchmark, and the focus on resource-constrained environments, while important, may have a narrower scope compared to the general problem of aligning models with human intent addressed in paper 2.

Therefore, considering the novelty of the approach, the soundness of the methodology, and the potential for broader impact, paper 2 (Contrastive Preference Learning) is more likely to be the accepted idea.

predicted:  Based on the provided project summaries, I believe that paper 2, "Efficiently Measuring the Cognitive Ability of LLMs: An Adaptive Testing Perspective," is more likely to be the accepted idea between the two.

Here are the key factors that support this decision:

Novelty:
- Paper 2 introduces a novel adaptive testing framework inspired by Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) from psychometrics, which dynamically adjusts the difficulty of test questions based on the model's performance. This approach is more innovative compared to the traditional benchmarking method proposed in paper 1.

Soundness:
- The adaptive testing framework in paper 2 is based on well-established theories and methods from cognitive science and psychometrics, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Fisher Information. This solid theoretical foundation enhances the soundness of the proposed method.
- The experiments in paper 2 are designed to compare the cognitive abilities of LLMs with human performance across three key areas: Subject Knowledge, Mathematical Reasoning, and Programming. This comprehensive evaluation approach strengthens the validity of the results.

Potential Impact:
- The adaptive testing framework proposed in paper 2 has the potential to revolutionize the way we evaluate the cognitive abilities of LLMs. By dynamically adjusting the difficulty of test questions, it enables more accurate and efficient assessment of LLMs' abilities using fewer questions.
- The ability to compare LLMs' cognitive abilities with human performance across various domains can provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of these models. This information can guide future research and development efforts in the field of AI and natural language processing.

In contrast, while paper 1 proposes a benchmark for evaluating the low-level visual abilities of MLLMs, it lacks the novelty and potential impact of the adaptive testing framework introduced in paper 2. The traditional benchmarking approach in paper 1 may not be as efficient or accurate as the dynamic evaluation method proposed in paper 2.

Therefore, considering the novelty, soundness, and potential impact, I believe that paper 2, "Efficiently Measuring the Cognitive Ability of LLMs: An Adaptive Testing Perspective," is more likely to be the accepted idea between the two proposals.

1. Novelty: The proposed Hypothesis-based and Structure-based (HS) prompting method addresses a real-world challenge in medical and business diagnosis, which is not well-tackled by existing prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph of Thoughts (GoT). The integration of the MECE framework and the hypothesis generation and validation process brings a novel approach to solving complex many-to-one problems.

2. Soundness: The HS method follows a structured approach, breaking down complex problems into discrete parts using the MECE principle. The step-by-step process of problem definition, structuring, hypothesis generation, efficient search, and solution development provides a solid foundation for the method. The validation through diverse case studies in business consulting and medical diagnosis, evaluated by domain experts, adds to the soundness of the approach.

3. Potential Impact: The proposed method has the potential to significantly improve the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios like healthcare and business. By efficiently identifying root causes and devising appropriate solutions, the HS method can have a substantial impact on decision-making processes in these domains. The successful application of the method could lead to more accurate diagnoses, better treatment plans, and improved business strategies.

In comparison, while paper 2 (SaProt: Protein Language Modeling with Structure-aware Vocabulary) proposes an interesting approach to incorporate structural information into protein language models, its potential impact seems more limited to the specific domain of protein structure and function prediction. The novelty of the structure-aware vocabulary is notable, but the overall approach appears to be an extension of existing protein language modeling techniques.

Therefore, considering the novelty, soundness, and potential impact, I believe that paper 1 (Hypothesis- and Structure-based Prompting for Medical and Business Diagnosis) is more likely to be the accepted idea.

predicted:  After carefully reviewing both project proposals, I believe that the accepted idea is paper 1: GraphAgent: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Learning on Text-attributed Graphs.

Here are the key factors that led to this decision:

Novelty:
- GraphAgent presents a novel approach to learning on text-attributed graphs by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to reframe the problem as an agent planning task. This is a creative and innovative way to address the challenges of balancing effectiveness and interpretability in graph neural networks (GNNs).
- The use of LLMs to provide interpretable explanations in the context of graph learning is a fresh perspective that has not been extensively explored in previous works.

Soundness:
- The proposed method is well-motivated and grounded in the recent successes of LLMs in providing interpretable explanations across various applications.
- The step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive and includes a diverse set of datasets, a systematic approach to prompt construction, and a thorough analysis of the results.
- The hierarchical memory mechanism and the use of in-context learning with high-quality demonstration examples are sound techniques that can enhance the agent's effectiveness and interpretability.

Potential Impact:
- GraphAgent has the potential to significantly improve the interpretability of learning on text-attributed graphs, which is crucial for many real-world applications where understanding the reasoning behind predictions is essential.
- The proposed method can inspire further research on leveraging LLMs for interpretable learning in other domains beyond graph-structured data.
- The comprehensive evaluation plan, including ablation studies and case studies, can provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of the approach, guiding future research directions.

In comparison, while paper 2 (LLM4QPE) presents an interesting approach to quantum property estimation using LLMs, the potential impact and novelty seem less significant than GraphAgent. The application domain is more specialized, and the methodology, while sound, does not present as much of a departure from existing techniques as GraphAgent does.

Therefore, based on the novelty, soundness, and potential impact, I believe that paper 1 (GraphAgent) is the accepted idea between the two proposals.

0.30684
predicted:  After carefully reviewing both papers, I believe that paper 1 (LongLoRA) should be accepted over paper 2 (Large Language Models as Superpositions of Cultural Perspectives). Here are the key reasons:

Novelty and Technical Contributions:
Paper 1 introduces novel techniques, namely Shifted Sparse Attention (S2-Attn) and an improved version of LoRA (LoRA+), to efficiently extend the context length of large language models. These innovations address the computational challenges of training LLMs with long context sizes, making it more feasible for researchers to work with long-context tasks. In contrast, paper 2 primarily focuses on studying the context-dependent behavior of LLMs using existing psychological tools, which, while interesting, does not introduce significant technical advancements.

Soundness and Experimental Design:
Paper 1 presents a well-structured experiment plan, including diverse datasets (Redpajama, PG19, proof-pile, LongAlpaca), multiple model sizes (7B, 13B, 70B), and comprehensive evaluation metrics (perplexity, retrieval-based tasks, supervised fine-tuning). The proposed techniques are clearly explained and can be easily implemented. Paper 2, while using established psychological questionnaires, lacks a rigorous experimental design to control for confounding factors and does not provide a clear methodology for inducing perspectives in LLMs.

Potential Impact:
Paper 1 has the potential to significantly impact the field by enabling researchers to work with long-context tasks more efficiently. The proposed techniques can be applied to various domains, such as summarization, question-answering, and dialogue systems, where understanding long-range dependencies is crucial. Paper 2, while providing insights into the context-dependent behavior of LLMs, has limited practical implications for improving the performance or efficiency of these models.

In summary, paper 1 (LongLoRA) demonstrates strong novelty, technical contributions, experimental soundness, and potential for real-world impact, making it a more suitable candidate for acceptance compared to paper 2.

The key factors that support this decision are:

1. Novelty: Paper 2 proposes a novel approach of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language explanations for agent behavior, which is independent of the underlying model's representation. This is a fresh perspective compared to existing methods that rely on rules, vision-based cues, semantic concepts, or trajectories.

2. Soundness: The proposed three-step process in paper 2, involving policy distillation, decision path extraction, and LLM-based explanation generation, is well-structured and grounded in sound principles. The experiments in a multi-agent search-and-rescue environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in generating explanations as helpful as those produced by a human domain expert.

3. Potential Impact: Explainable AI is a crucial area of research, especially as intelligent agents are increasingly deployed in safety-critical settings. Paper 2 addresses this important problem by providing a method to generate plausible and understandable explanations for agent behavior, which can enhance trust and collaboration between humans and AI systems.

In contrast, while paper 1 "Unveiling and Manipulating Prompt Influence in Large Language Models" also proposes an interesting method for understanding input saliency in LLMs, the meta-review suggests that the evaluation results are not entirely convincing, and there are some confusions about key technical components. This makes it difficult to assess the overall contribution and novelty of the work.

Therefore, based on the provided information, paper 2 appears to be the stronger and more impactful proposal, making it the likely accepted idea.

predicted:  After carefully reviewing both papers, I believe that paper 1, "Structured Video-Language Modeling with Temporal Grouping and Spatial Grounding," is more likely to be accepted at a top AI conference. Here are the key reasons:

1. Novelty: Paper 1 introduces a novel approach, S-ViLM, which incorporates structured video-language interactions during the pre-training stage. The proposed inter-clip spatial grounding and intra-clip temporal grouping techniques are innovative and address the limitations of existing video-language pre-training methods.

2. Soundness: The methodology in paper 1 is well-designed and comprehensive. The authors propose a dual-encoder video-language modeling framework with three primary training objectives, which are clearly explained and justified. The experiment plan is detailed, covering dataset selection, model architecture, training objectives, pre-training setup, fine-tuning setup, and evaluation metrics.

3. Potential Impact: Paper 1 has the potential to significantly improve the performance of video-language models on downstream tasks that require detailed understanding of spatial and temporal aspects, such as text-video retrieval, video question answering, video action recognition, and temporal action localization. The proposed method could lead to more expressive spatiotemporal features and enhanced reasoning capabilities.

In contrast, while paper 2, "Word Importance Explains How Prompts Affect Language Model Outputs," addresses an important problem of understanding the impact of individual words on LLM outputs, the proposed method seems less groundbreaking. The idea of systematically masking words to evaluate their importance is inspired by existing techniques like permutation importance for tabular data. Additionally, the experiments focus on a limited set of scoring functions and datasets, which may not fully demonstrate the generalizability of the approach.

Therefore, based on the novelty, soundness, and potential impact, I believe that paper 1 has a higher likelihood of being accepted at a top AI conference.

Novelty: Paper 1 proposes a novel self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC) that eliminates the need for human-crafted demonstrations in in-context learning (ICL). This is a fresh perspective on ICL, as it challenges the standard paradigm and explores the inherent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate their own demonstrations. In contrast, paper 2 focuses on the known problem of LLM censorship and proposes a shift towards security-based defenses, which, while important, is not as groundbreaking.

Soundness: The SEC method proposed in paper 1 is well-defined and grounded in the inherent capabilities of LLMs. The authors provide a clear step-by-step experiment plan to evaluate the effectiveness of SEC across various benchmarks and compare it against baseline ICL methods. The proposed method is straightforward and has the potential to simplify the ICL process. Paper 2, on the other hand, proposes a high-level idea of treating censorship as a security problem but lacks a concrete method or algorithm to address the issue.

Potential Impact: Paper 1 has the potential to significantly impact the field of in-context learning by making it more efficient and accessible. Eliminating the need for human-generated demonstrations can save time and resources while also reducing selection biases. This could lead to more widespread adoption of ICL and accelerate research in this area. Paper 2, while addressing an important issue, has a more limited scope and does not provide a clear solution that can be readily implemented.

In summary, paper 1 stands out in terms of novelty, soundness, and potential impact. The self-contemplation prompting strategy is a creative and well-defined approach that challenges the status quo in in-context learning. It has the potential to simplify and streamline the ICL process, making it more efficient and accessible. Therefore, I believe that paper 1 is more likely to be the accepted idea.

predicted:  Based on the provided project summaries, I believe paper 2 "How Do Transformers Learn In-Context Beyond Simple Functions? A Case Study on Learning with Representations" is more likely to be the accepted paper compared to paper 1 "LLMatic: Neural Architecture Search via Large Language Models and Quality Diversity Optimization". Here are the key reasons:

Novelty and Significance of the Problem:
Paper 2 addresses a more fundamental and less explored question in the field of in-context learning (ICL) with transformers. It goes beyond the simple function classes studied in existing theories and mechanistic understandings of ICL, and investigates how transformers can handle more complex ICL tasks involving fixed representation functions. This is a significant step towards understanding the capabilities and limitations of transformers in real-world scenarios.
In contrast, paper 1 focuses on the problem of neural architecture search (NAS), which has been extensively studied in the literature. While the proposed method of combining LLMs with quality diversity optimization is novel, the overall problem is less fundamental compared to paper 2.

Soundness and Rigor of the Approach:
Paper 2 provides both theoretical and empirical evidence to support its claims. It theoretically shows that transformers can approximately implement the optimal ICL algorithm for tasks involving fixed representation functions with mild depth and size. Empirically, it demonstrates that trained transformers achieve near-optimal ICL performance and exhibit the desired dissection of lower layers transforming the dataset and upper layers performing linear ICL. The use of linear probing techniques and pasting experiments further strengthens the analysis.
Paper 1, while proposing an interesting method, lacks the same level of theoretical grounding. The experiments are limited to the CIFAR-10 dataset and NAS-bench-201 benchmark, which may not be sufficient to establish the generalizability and robustness of the approach.

Potential Impact:
Paper 2 has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how transformers learn and perform in-context learning in complex scenarios. The insights gained from this study can guide the development of more efficient and effective transformer models for real-world applications.
Paper 1, while proposing a potentially more efficient NAS method, has a relatively narrower scope of impact. It is unclear how well the approach would generalize to other domains and tasks beyond image classification.

In summary, based on the novelty and significance of the problem, the soundness and rigor of the approach, and the potential impact, I believe paper 2 "How Do Transformers Learn In-Context Beyond Simple Functions? A Case Study on Learning with Representations" is more likely to be the accepted paper compared to paper 1 "LLMatic: Neural Architecture Search via Large Language Models and Quality Diversity Optimization".

0.314835
predicted:  After carefully reviewing both papers, I believe that paper 1, "On-Policy Distillation of Language Models: Learning from Self-Generated Mistakes," is more likely to be accepted at a top AI conference. Here are the key reasons:

Novelty and Potential Impact:
Paper 1 addresses a critical issue in knowledge distillation for auto-regressive sequence models, namely the distribution mismatch between training and inference. The proposed Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD) method offers a novel approach by training the student model on its self-generated sequences, reducing the train-inference distribution mismatch. This on-policy approach, combined with the flexibility to use alternative loss functions and integrate with reinforcement learning fine-tuning, has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of model compression for language models. Given the increasing importance of efficient deployment of large language models, this work could have a substantial impact on the field.

In contrast, while paper 2 introduces an axiomatic approach to model-agnostic concept explanations, the novelty and potential impact seem more limited. The proposed method integrates previous research and provides a more efficient implementation, but the overall contribution to the field of interpretable machine learning appears less significant compared to paper 1.

Soundness and Methodology:
Both papers present well-structured experiment plans, covering a range of datasets, models, and evaluation metrics. However, paper 1 demonstrates a more comprehensive evaluation, considering multiple tasks (summarization, translation, arithmetic reasoning) and model sizes (T5 variants). The inclusion of task-agnostic instruction tuning further strengthens the generalizability of the proposed method. Additionally, the comparison with multiple baseline knowledge distillation methods and the analysis of different divergences and student data fractions provide a thorough assessment of the proposed GKD approach.

Paper 2, while presenting a sound methodology, has a more limited scope in terms of datasets and models. The experiments focus primarily on the a-Pascal dataset and a few model architectures (logistic regression, random forest, ResNet-18, CLIP). While the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed measures, the overall evaluation is less extensive compared to paper 1.

In conclusion, based on the novelty, potential impact, and the soundness of the methodology, I believe that paper 1, "On-Policy Distillation of Language Models: Learning from Self-Generated Mistakes," is more likely to be accepted at a top AI conference.

Here are the key factors that led to this decision:

1. Novelty: The idea of using abstraction to guide the reasoning process in LLMs is a novel approach. While paper 1 focuses on fine-tuning and instruction tuning, which are more established methods, paper 2 introduces a new prompting technique called STEP-BACK PROMPTING that draws inspiration from human problem-solving strategies.

2. Soundness: The proposed method in paper 2 is well-motivated and grounded in the observation that humans often step back to derive high-level principles when solving complex problems. The two-step process of Abstraction and Reasoning is clearly defined and demonstrated through few-shot exemplar demonstrations. In contrast, paper 1's approach of fine-tuning and instruction tuning, while effective, is less innovative.

3. Potential Impact: Improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs has significant implications across various domains, from question answering to multi-step reasoning tasks. The STEP-BACK PROMPTING method introduced in paper 2 has the potential to enhance LLMs' performance on a wide range of complex reasoning tasks, making it more impactful than the task-specific fine-tuning approach proposed in paper 1.

4. Evaluation: Paper 2 evaluates the proposed method on a diverse set of tasks, including domain-specific reasoning, knowledge-intensive question answering, and multi-hop reasoning. This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the broad applicability of the STEP-BACK PROMPTING method. Paper 1, while evaluating on multiple specification-heavy tasks, has a narrower focus.

5. Insights: The error analysis proposed in paper 2 aims to understand the types of errors corrected and introduced by STEP-BACK PROMPTING, providing valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of the method. Paper 1's error analysis focuses more on the reasons behind the failure of in-context learning, which, while informative, is less directly related to the proposed method.

In summary, the novelty of the STEP-BACK PROMPTING method, its potential for broad impact, and the comprehensive evaluation plan make paper 2 a stronger candidate for acceptance compared to paper 1.

predicted:  After carefully considering both papers, I believe that paper 1, "Causal Inference Using LLM-Guided Discovery," is the more promising and likely to be accepted idea.

Novelty: Paper 1 presents a novel approach to causal inference by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to guide the discovery process. The use of LLMs to obtain causal order and integrate with established causal discovery algorithms is an innovative and promising direction. In contrast, paper 2 focuses on a more well-known approach of imitating proprietary language models, which has been explored in recent literature.

Soundness: The methodology proposed in paper 1 is well-structured and grounded in established causal inference techniques. The authors provide a clear step-by-step experiment plan, including different prompting strategies and integration with constraint-based and score-based methods. The evaluation metrics, such as Dtop and effect estimation error, are appropriate for assessing the performance of the proposed method. Paper 2, while addressing an important question, lacks the same level of methodological rigor and relies heavily on empirical evaluation without a strong theoretical foundation.

Potential Impact: Paper 1 has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of causal inference by simplifying the process and reducing the dependency on complete graph structures. The proposed method could have wide-ranging applications in various domains where causal understanding is crucial, such as healthcare, social sciences, and policy-making. Paper 2, while providing insights into the limitations of imitating proprietary language models, has a more narrow scope and may not have the same level of broad impact.

In summary, paper 1 stands out for its novelty, soundness, and potential for significant impact in the field of causal inference. The use of LLMs to guide causal discovery is a promising direction that could lead to new avenues of research and practical applications. Therefore, I believe that paper 1 is more likely to be accepted compared to paper 2.

predicted:  Based on the provided information, I believe paper 2 "Chain-of-Experts: When LLMs Meet Complex Operations Research Problems" is more likely to be the accepted paper compared to paper 1 "All Languages Matter: On the Multilingual Safety of Large Language Models". Here are the key reasons:

Novelty: 
- Paper 1 focuses on evaluating multilingual safety of LLMs, which is an important but relatively straightforward extension of existing LLM safety benchmarks to multiple languages. 
- In contrast, Paper 2 proposes a novel multi-agent cooperative framework called Chain-of-Experts to enable LLMs to solve complex operations research problems. The idea of having specialized expert agents collaborating under the orchestration of a conductor agent is quite innovative.

Soundness:
- Both papers have well-designed experiments. Paper 1 creates a new multilingual safety benchmark XSafety covering 14 safety issues in 10 languages. Paper 2 evaluates on an existing elementary OR dataset LPWP and also constructs a new ComplexOR dataset with expert annotations.
- Paper 2 has a more comprehensive and principled approach. The Chain-of-Experts framework is grounded in multi-agent systems and includes well-defined components like conductor, multiple specialized experts, reducer, and incorporates mechanisms like forward thought construction and backward reflection. This structured approach makes the methodology more sound.

Potential Impact:
- Paper 1 makes meaningful contributions in highlighting and quantifying the multilingual safety gaps in LLMs. The prompting methods to improve safety are also valuable. However, the overall impact is somewhat limited to the safety aspect.
- Paper 2 has the potential for a broader impact. Enabling LLMs to automatically model and solve complex OR problems can significantly accelerate and scale up the application of OR in various domains. The Chain-of-Experts framework is also a general approach that could inspire new ways of combining multiple agents/models for complex reasoning tasks.

In summary, while both papers are well-motivated and have their merits, Paper 2 demonstrates more novelty in the multi-agent framework, has a sound and principled methodology, and promises a wider-ranging impact in empowering LLMs for complex problem-solving. Therefore, Paper 2 is more likely to be favored by the program committee and get accepted.

After carefully reviewing the two project proposals, I believe that paper 1, "Controllable Text-to-Image Generation with Automatic Sketches," is more likely to be the accepted idea between the two.

Here are the key factors that led to this decision:

Novelty:
Paper 1 introduces a novel approach, Control-GPT, that leverages the power of GPT-4 to generate programmatic sketches in TikZ code based on text prompts. This innovative use of LLMs to enhance the controllability of text-to-image generation models is a fresh and creative solution to the problem of spatial reasoning in image generation.

Soundness:
The proposed method in paper 1 is well-structured and logically sound. The step-by-step experiment plan is clearly outlined, and the authors have considered the lack of aligned text, images, and sketches datasets by converting instance masks from existing datasets into polygon representations. The evaluation metrics and comparison with baseline models demonstrate a rigorous approach to validating the effectiveness of Control-GPT.

Controllable text-to-image generation has numerous applications, from creative design to data augmentation. The ability to generate images that accurately follow complex textual instructions, particularly those involving spatial relationships, could significantly enhance the usability and practicality of text-to-image models. Control-GPT's approach of leveraging LLMs to generate sketches could inspire further research in integrating language models with image generation tasks.

In comparison, while paper 2, "SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask," addresses an important problem in transformer architectures and proposes a novel solution, its potential impact and novelty seem less significant than paper 1. The sparse linear attention mechanism, although innovative, is more incremental in nature compared to the integration of LLMs with text-to-image generation.

Novelty: Paper 2 proposes a novel approach, TP-BERTa, which specifically addresses the challenge of applying pre-trained language models to tabular data prediction. The introduction of relative magnitude tokenization and intra-feature attention is a creative solution to bridge the gap between the discrete text representation space of language models and the numerical feature values in tables. This novel approach has the potential to open up new avenues for leveraging the power of language models in tabular data tasks.

Soundness: The proposed method in paper 2 is well-motivated and grounded in the limitations of existing approaches. The authors provide a clear explanation of the heterogeneity and feature space shifts among tables, which hinder the transferability of deep neural networks. The step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive, covering pre-training, fine-tuning, and extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines. The inclusion of ablation studies further strengthens the soundness of the approach by evaluating the impact of different components.

Potential Impact: Tabular data prediction is a prevalent problem across various domains, and the proposed TP-BERTa method has the potential to significantly improve performance on a wide range of tasks. By leveraging the knowledge transfer capabilities of language models, TP-BERTa could enable more effective and efficient learning on diverse tabular datasets. The successful application of pre-trained language models to tabular data prediction could have far-reaching implications, benefiting industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, where tabular data is abundant.

In contrast, while paper 1 addresses an important issue of worst-performing categories in CLIP models, its potential impact seems more limited in scope compared to paper 2. The proposed method in paper 1 focuses on identifying and improving specific categories, whereas paper 2 presents a more general framework for enhancing tabular data prediction using language models.

This is a fresh perspective on addressing the limitations of existing instruction-based image editing methods. In contrast, paper 1 focuses on analyzing the differences between human-generated and ChatGPT-generated text, which has been explored in previous studies.

Soundness: The methodology in paper 2 is well-structured and technically sound. The authors propose a clear architecture for MGIE, consisting of an MLLM for generating instructions and a diffusion model for performing the actual image editing. The training objectives and fine-tuning process are clearly defined, and the evaluation metrics cover various aspects of image editing quality. Paper 1, while interesting, relies heavily on existing tools like Roget's thesaurus and pre-trained models, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences between human and ChatGPT-generated text.

Both papers address important problems in their respective domains. Paper 1 focuses on improving the robustness and stealthiness of backdoor attacks in deep neural networks, while Paper 2 investigates the theoretical and empirical differences between prefix language models (prefixLM) and causal language models (causalLM) in the context of in-context learning.

Paper 1 proposes a novel trigger called VSSC-trigger, which aims to overcome the limitations of existing invisible triggers by being more resistant to visual distortions during inference. The authors present a well-structured experiment plan that covers various aspects of the proposed method, including trigger selection, poisoned dataset generation, and robustness evaluation against different types of distortions. The potential impact of this work is significant, as it highlights the need for more robust defenses against backdoor attacks in real-world scenarios.

Paper 2, on the other hand, provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of prefixLM and causalLM, showing that prefixLM converges to the optimal solution in linear regression tasks, while causalLM's convergence dynamics follow that of an online gradient descent algorithm. The authors support their theoretical claims with empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets using various types of transformers, including large language models. The findings of this paper have important implications for the design and application of transformer models in in-context learning tasks.

While both papers make valuable contributions, Paper 2 stands out in terms of its novelty and potential impact. The theoretical insights provided by the authors shed light on the fundamental differences between prefixLM and causalLM, which can guide the development of more effective transformer architectures for in-context learning. Moreover, the empirical experiments demonstrate the generalizability of the findings across different settings and tasks, making the work more broadly applicable.

In conclusion, although both papers have their merits, Paper 2 is the stronger candidate for acceptance due to its novel theoretical contributions and the potential impact on the design and application of transformer models in in-context learning.

Paper 1 tackles the problem of workload imbalances caused by dynamic training schemes in distributed LLM training. The proposed DYNPIPE framework offers a practical solution by dynamically redistributing workloads among accelerators and elastically adapting GPU resources. The experiments are well-designed, covering both single-node and multi-node environments, and the results demonstrate significant improvements in training throughput and cost savings. However, the novelty of the approach may be limited as it builds upon existing load balancing techniques.

Paper 2 introduces Thought Propagation (TP), a novel approach to enhance the complex reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging insights from analogous problems. The motivation behind TP is well-justified, addressing the limitations of existing prompting methods that reason from scratch. The three-module design of TP (LLM Propose, LLM Solve, and LLM Aggregate) is innovative and has the potential to generalize to a wide range of tasks. The experiments cover diverse tasks, including Shortest-Path Reasoning, Creative Writing, and LLM-Agent Planning, demonstrating the broad applicability of the proposed method.

Both papers address important challenges in the field of large language models (LLMs). Paper 1 focuses on accelerating pre-training while maintaining model performance, while Paper 2 tackles the issue of jailbreaking attacks on LLMs.

Paper 1 proposes a novel progressive learning framework called Masked Structural Growth (MSG) to speed up pre-training by 2x. The key innovations are the growth schedules involving all possible dimensions and the strictly function-preserving growth operators. The experiments are well-designed, covering both Bert and GPT models, and the evaluation on downstream tasks like GLUE, SQuAD, and Wikitext2 provides a comprehensive assessment of the method's effectiveness.

Paper 2 introduces SmoothLLM, an algorithm to mitigate jailbreaking attacks by perturbing input prompts and aggregating predictions. While the problem of jailbreaking attacks is crucial, the proposed method seems to be more of an engineering solution rather than a fundamental advancement. The experiments cover a range of LLMs and datasets, but the evaluation metrics (attack success rate and nominal performance) may not fully capture the method's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Considering the novelty, soundness, and potential impact, Paper 1 appears to be the stronger submission. The MSG framework addresses a fundamental bottleneck in LLM pre-training and offers a principled approach with theoretical grounding. The 2x speedup in pre-training could significantly accelerate research cycles and reduce the carbon footprint of LLM development. In contrast, while Paper 2 tackles an important problem, the proposed solution seems less innovative and may have limited long-term impact.

On the other hand, the Text2Reward paper tackles a longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning by leveraging the power of large language models to generate interpretable and flexible dense reward functions. The proposed framework is data-free and allows for iterative refinement with human feedback, addressing the limitations of existing methods. The experiments on diverse robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated reward codes in training successful RL policies.

While both papers make valuable contributions, the Text2Reward paper stands out in terms of its potential impact and broader applicability. Automating reward shaping with language models can significantly reduce the development costs and expertise required for designing effective reward functions in RL. The ability to generate interpretable and customizable reward codes based on natural language goals opens up new possibilities for applying RL to a wide range of real-world problems.

LLM-Prop addresses the limitations of current graph neural network-based methods in modeling complex interactions within crystals. By leveraging the expressive power of text data and the capabilities of LLMs, LLM-Prop has the potential to outperform existing methods in predicting crystal properties. The proposed experiment plan is well-structured, with clear steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The comparison with GNN-based models and a text-based model ensures a fair assessment of LLM-Prop's performance. The potential impact of LLM-Prop is significant, as it could streamline the crystal design process and accelerate materials discovery.

On the other hand, paper 2 focuses on understanding and improving the transferability of adversarial attacks. While the problem is important, the proposed method, Common Weakness Attack (CWA), lacks a strong theoretical foundation. The authors introduce two properties, flatness of the loss landscape and closeness to the local optimum, but do not provide a rigorous justification for how these properties contribute to transferability. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering both image classification and object detection tasks, and includes comparisons with various baseline methods. However, the novelty and potential impact of the proposed method are less clear compared to LLM-Prop.

Considering the novelty, soundness, and potential impact, LLM-Prop (paper 1) appears to be the stronger candidate for acceptance. The authors present a well-motivated and innovative approach to predicting crystal properties, backed by a solid experiment plan. The potential impact of LLM-Prop in accelerating materials discovery is more evident compared to the incremental improvements in adversarial transferability offered by paper 2.

Both papers address important problems related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose novel methods to tackle them. However, the Neural Sandbox Framework (Paper 1) stands out in terms of its potential impact and the soundness of its approach.

The Neural Sandbox Framework addresses the crucial issue of identifying and mitigating spurious concepts in LLM decisions, which can lead to biased or incorrect predictions. The proposed method not only aims to improve the accuracy of LLMs but also enhances their interpretability by providing a descriptive tool for understanding the model's decision-making process. The incorporation of predefined concept words (cop-words) to guide the classification process is a novel approach that sets it apart from existing methods.

Moreover, the extensive experiment plan, which includes evaluations involving the injection of foreign cop-words, intrachanged cop-words, neutral cop-words, and bias terminologies, demonstrates the authors' commitment to thoroughly testing the robustness and reliability of their method. This comprehensive evaluation strategy strengthens the soundness of the proposed framework.

In contrast, while Raidar (Paper 2) presents an interesting approach to detecting AI-generated text, its novelty and potential impact seem less significant compared to the Neural Sandbox Framework. The method relies on the observation that LLMs tend to make fewer modifications to AI-generated text when asked to rewrite it, which, although insightful, may not be as groundbreaking as the cop-words approach in Paper 1.

The LongLoRA paper tackles a critical issue in LLM training - the computational cost of training models with long context sizes. By introducing Shifted Sparse Attention (S2-Attn) and an improved version of LoRA (LoRA+), the authors propose an efficient and effective method for extending the context length of LLMs while maintaining their original architectures. This innovation has the potential to make long-context LLMs more accessible to researchers and enable their application in tasks that require understanding long documents or answering complex questions.

The proposed metaphor of viewing LLMs as superpositions of perspectives is thought-provoking but may not directly lead to improvements in LLM performance or efficiency.

Furthermore, the experimental plan in the LongLoRA paper is well-structured and includes a range of datasets and evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also provide specific details on the training procedure and implementation of S2-Attn and LoRA+, demonstrating the soundness of their approach.
