Both papers tackle interesting questions related to the capabilities and generalization behavior of transformer-based language models. However, the second paper, "Tell, Don't Show: Internalized Reasoning influences how LLMs generalize," presents a more novel and impactful contribution to the field.

The first paper, "When can transformers reason with abstract symbols?", investigates the relational reasoning capabilities of transformers and proposes modifications to improve data efficiency. While this is a valuable contribution, the problem of relational reasoning in transformers has been explored in prior work, and the proposed modifications are relatively incremental.

On the other hand, the second paper addresses a more fundamental question about how declarative knowledge influences the generalization behavior of language models during domain shifts. This is a crucial problem for ensuring the safety and fairness of LLMs in real-world applications. The authors propose a novel approach to study this question using toy models and carefully designed experiments with ablations to rule out trivial explanations.

The second paper's findings have the potential to significantly impact our understanding of how LLMs internalize knowledge and generalize to unseen examples. This could lead to new techniques for controlling and improving the generalization behavior of LLMs, which is essential for their safe and effective deployment.

In terms of methodology, both papers present well-designed experiments with clear steps and evaluation metrics. However, the second paper's use of toy models and ablations demonstrates a more rigorous approach to isolating the effect of declarative knowledge on generalization.

Overall, while both papers make valuable contributions, the second paper's novelty, potential impact, and methodological rigor make it a stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.
