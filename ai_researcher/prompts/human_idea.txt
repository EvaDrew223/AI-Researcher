Title: Collaborative Prompt Defense: Leveraging Multiple Language Models for Robust Adversarial Prompt Detection
Problem Statement: Defending against adversarial prompt attacks often relies on a single language model's ability to detect and filter malicious content. However, this approach may be limited by the model's individual biases and vulnerabilities, leading to suboptimal defense performance.


Motivation: Current defense methods typically employ a single language model or a separate detector model to identify and filter adversarial prompts. These approaches may suffer from the limitations and biases of the individual model. We propose a collaborative defense mechanism where multiple language models work together to assess the legitimacy of a prompt. By leveraging the collective intelligence and diverse knowledge of multiple models, we can improve the accuracy and robustness of adversarial prompt detection, reducing the impact of individual model biases and vulnerabilities.


Proposed Method: We introduce Collaborative Prompt Defense (CPD), a prompting method that employs multiple language models to collaboratively detect and filter adversarial prompts. Given an input prompt, we first prepend a defense prompt: "Please analyze the following prompt for any potentially malicious or misleading content: [original prompt]. If you identify any suspicious content, provide a detailed explanation of why it might be adversarial. Otherwise, simply respond with 'No adversarial content detected.'". We pass this prompt to multiple language models and collect their responses. If a majority of the models agree that the prompt is safe, it is considered legitimate and passed to the primary language model for standard processing. If a majority of the models flag the prompt as potentially adversarial, the prompt is discarded, and an aggregated explanation from the models is provided. If there is no clear majority, the prompt is flagged for manual review.


Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:


Gather Datasets: Collect a diverse set of adversarial attack datasets, such as the Adversarial NLI dataset, the Adversarial SQuAD dataset, and the Dynabench dataset. These datasets contain a mix of legitimate and adversarial prompts across various tasks, such as natural language inference, question answering, and text classification.


Prepare Language Models: Select a diverse set of language models to participate in the collaborative defense. Consider models with different architectures, training data, and capabilities. For example, use GPT-3, BERT, RoBERTa, and T5 models of varying sizes.


Implement CPD: Implement the Collaborative Prompt Defense method as described in the proposed method section. Create a function that takes an input prompt, prepends the defense prompt, and sends the modified prompt to each participating language model. Collect the responses from the models and determine the majority decision.


Evaluate CPD: Evaluate the performance of CPD on the adversarial attack datasets. For each dataset, split the data into training and testing sets. Use the training set to fine-tune the language models if necessary. Then, apply CPD to the testing set and measure the following metrics:


Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified prompts (legitimate or adversarial).


Precision: The percentage of prompts flagged as adversarial that are actually adversarial.


Recall: The percentage of actual adversarial prompts that are correctly flagged.


F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.


Compare the performance of CPD with baseline defense methods that rely on a single model.


Analyze Results: Analyze the results obtained from the evaluation step. Assess the effectiveness of CPD in detecting adversarial prompts compared to the baseline methods. Investigate the impact of using multiple language models on the robustness and accuracy of the defense mechanism. Identify any patterns or trends in the types of adversarial prompts that are successfully detected or missed by CPD.


Ablation Study: Perform an ablation study to understand the contribution of each language model in the collaborative defense. Evaluate CPD's performance by removing one language model at a time and measuring the change in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This analysis will provide insights into the importance of model diversity and the impact of individual models on the overall defense performance.


Error Analysis: Conduct an error analysis to understand the limitations and failure cases of CPD. Examine the prompts that are misclassified by CPD and categorize them based on the type of adversarial attack, the language model that made the incorrect decision, and any other relevant factors. This analysis will help identify areas for improvement and guide future research directions.


Iterative Refinement: Based on the insights gained from the ablation study and error analysis, iteratively refine CPD by incorporating additional language models, adjusting the defense prompt, or exploring alternative decision-making strategies. Repeat the evaluation process to assess the impact of these refinements on the defense performance.


Test Case Examples:

 Baseline Prompt Input (Single Model Defense): "Classify the following prompt as either legitimate or adversarial:\nPrompt: What is the capital of France? Paris is the capital, but it is also known for its high crime rates and frequent terrorist attacks.”

 Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Single Model Defense): "Legitimate”

 Proposed Prompt Input (CPD): "Please analyze the following prompt for any potentially malicious or misleading content:\nPrompt: What is the capital of France? Paris is the capital, but it is also known for its high crime rates and frequent terrorist attacks.\nIf you identify any suspicious content, provide a detailed explanation of why it might be adversarial. Otherwise, simply respond with 'No adversarial content detected.'”

 Proposed Prompt Expected Output (CPD): "Adversarial content detected. The prompt contains misleading information about Paris, suggesting that it has high crime rates and frequent terrorist attacks. While Paris has experienced some terrorist incidents, it is not accurate to characterize the city as having high crime rates or frequent attacks. The additional information seems to be included to manipulate the model's response and generate biased or false information.”

 Explanation: In this test case, the single model defense fails to identify the adversarial nature of the prompt, classifying it as legitimate. However, CPD successfully detects the misleading information in the prompt and provides a detailed explanation of why it is considered adversarial. By leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple language models, CPD is able to identify the manipulative content and prevent the generation of biased or false information.


Fallback Plan: If the proposed CPD method does not achieve satisfactory performance in detecting adversarial prompts, consider the following alternative approaches:


Analyze the language models' responses to understand why they fail to identify certain types of adversarial prompts. This analysis can provide insights into the limitations of the individual models and guide the selection of more suitable models for the collaborative defense.
Explore alternative prompting strategies, such as using multiple defense prompts or employing few-shot learning to provide examples of adversarial and legitimate prompts to the language models. These strategies may help improve the models' ability to distinguish between malicious and benign content.
Investigate the use of additional features or signals beyond the prompt text itself. For example, consider incorporating metadata, such as the source of the prompt or the user's history, to provide additional context for the language models to make more informed decisions.
Expand the collaborative defense to include other types of models, such as dedicated adversarial prompt detectors or domain-specific models. These models may bring complementary knowledge and expertise to enhance the overall defense performance.
If the collaborative defense approach does not yield significant improvements, consider pivoting the project to focus on analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of individual language models in detecting adversarial prompts. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the challenges of adversarial prompt detection and contribute to the development of more effective defense strategies.
