On the other hand, the second paper delves into a fundamental question of how transformers perform in-context learning in complex scenarios involving fixed representation functions. The paper provides a solid theoretical analysis, showing that transformers can approximately implement optimal ICL algorithms with mild depth and size. The empirical results further support the theoretical findings, demonstrating that trained transformers achieve near-optimal ICL performance and exhibit the desired dissection of lower layers transforming the dataset and upper layers performing linear ICL.

The second paper's approach to understanding the inner workings of transformers in more realistic settings is both novel and insightful. The findings have the potential to guide future research on improving transformer architectures and training methods for complex ICL tasks. Additionally, the paper's methodology, combining theoretical analysis with carefully designed experiments, is sound and rigorous.

In summary, while both papers have merits, the second paper's novelty, theoretical grounding, and potential impact on the field make it the stronger candidate for acceptance at a top AI conference.

Both papers present novel approaches to important problems in natural language processing and model interpretability. The first paper, "On-Policy Distillation of Language Models," addresses the issue of distribution mismatch in knowledge distillation for auto-regressive sequence models. The proposed method, Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD), trains the student model on its self-generated output sequences, reducing the train-inference distribution mismatch. The paper also explores the use of alternative divergence measures and the combination of GKD with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. The step-by-step experiment plan is well-structured, covering a range of tasks and models, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the effectiveness of model compression techniques.

The second paper, "An Axiomatic Approach to Model-Agnostic Concept Explanations," introduces a novel approach to concept explanations that is model-agnostic and satisfies three natural axioms. The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing concept explanation methods, which are often model-specific and require white-box access. The paper defines three measures (symmetric, class-conditioned, and concept-conditioned) and provides an efficient algorithm for estimating these measures. The experiment plan is well-designed, comparing different models and optimizers, and evaluating the effectiveness of prompt editing using the new measures.

While both papers make valuable contributions, the first paper has a slight edge in terms of potential impact. The proposed GKD method addresses a fundamental issue in knowledge distillation and has the potential to improve the performance of compressed models across a wide range of tasks. The combination of GKD with reinforcement learning fine-tuning also opens up new possibilities for optimizing sequence-level rewards while distilling knowledge from the teacher model.
